"SPIRITED AWAY","gogoschka-1","26 December 2013","Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) as a young quiet kid idolized explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) and his discovery of Paradise Falls. Ellie is much more animated and also a great fan of Muntz. Together they would marry and live their lives together until the day she dies. Now Carl is hounded by a property developer and forced to go to a retirement home. Instead he ties a sea of helium balloons to his home and float away to Paradise Falls. Wilderness Explorer scout Russell who's trying to get an Assisting the Elderly badge gets dragged along on the adventure.The first part of this movie is a real tear jerker. When Carl and Ellie's lives flash through the years, all the heart breaks and all the love just jump off the screen. Then there is comedy as the journey to Paradise Falls starts. The movie gets very surreal with dog translators, and a very colorful bird. The villain is a bit too villainy. The story gets too serious at times. But it ends almost as emotionally as it starts. It is one of the best of Pixar.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Buddy-51","3 May 2003","This film is possibly one of the best animated films of all time as it tells an emotional moving story while being funny. As I said the emotion in this film is full of heart and even though I didn't cry it will make most people cry. The characters in this are perfect even if it is a small character like Ellie or big character like Carl everybody gets so much development even Charles Muntz the villain of the film is also given development, even more than some superhero films nowadays. Also this film has comedy some Pixar films now just want to make you cry but in the 2000s they had mix of sad and funny moments. So overall this film is as close to perfect as an animated film can get, it is has a mix of emotions it is funny and sad when it needs to be it has so much heart and the characters are perfect. This film in my opinion is the best Pixar film.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Morejambo54","29 December 2020","I love Pixar and feel they have been pretty consistent. True I do prefer Toy Story over Cars and Finding Nemo over Ratatouille, but I find their films amazingly animated and thrilling. I thought that after the first two Toy Story films, that Pixar wouldn't be able to make a film to top them. WALL-E, yes I loved it, came pretty close, but in my opinion Up is Pixar's masterwork. And why do I say that? Because it is widely imaginative and astonishing in its emotional range.First of all, the animation is stupendous, beautiful backgrounds, beautifully drawn characters and stunning colours. The scenery and sights are just fantastic, down to the colour and visual detail that went into the film. Michael Giacchino's music is stunning as well, simple yet melodious and sublime. And I do have to concur with the majority about the opening montage; Finding Nemo had some beautiful moments and WALL-E's haunting isolation moved me close to tears but this opening montage was so poignant and utterly heart-breaking. It is quite simply one of the most beautiful and effective beginnings ever to an animated film.I have heard complaints that the story meanders when the talking dogs are introduced and that they were irritating. Can I respectfully disagree? What I loved about Up was how widely imaginative it was, in short why shouldn't a dog talk? It's an animated film, why does it have to COMPLETELY realistic? Elephants don't fly, look at what Disney did with Dumbo.The story, back on target was well written, thrilling and startling with a sense of adventure with enough action and high-flying escapism for kids and adults. The script had some truly hilarious and surreal moments, while Toy Story had wonderful sophisticated dialogue, the dialogue in Up made me laugh and it made me cry.And finally the characters, I loved them all, grumpy old widower Carl, stowaway Russell, eccentric adventurer Charles Muntz, the big bird and the hilarious Doug. Russell may be a tad annoying at first, but he grows on you. The voice acting is exceptional- Carl is voiced with real demeanour and depth by Ed Asner and Christopher Plummer, the wonderful underrated actor he is, is superb as Charles Muntz. But I do have to give mention to Bob Peterson, he is simply brilliant as Doug, he is really funny when he needs to be and never overdoes it.Overall, this is a wonderful film. There may be controversy over how Beauty and the Beast is no longer the only animated film to be nominated for best picture. Beauty and the Beast has been and always will be my favourite animated film and one of my favourite films of all time (The Lion King is a very close second), but Up is a great film and does deserve an award of some kind. 10/10 Bethany Cox","

"SPIRITED AWAY","supertom-3","2 April 2004","A young Carl Fredricksen wanted to find and explore Paradise Falls. Years later, he and Boy Scout Russell embark, transporting his house with thousands of balloons.I don't think an animation ever had such a huge impact on me, as Up did. I watched it in the cinema with my young nephews, they sat there laughing their heads off and giggling, I sat there in floods of tears.The story is wonderful, and I know it's an animation, but how nice to see an elderly gentleman as the lead. Carl is a fascinating character, he's a little quirky, he's funny, but he's heartbroken.The animation is glorious, it holds up incredibly well, and looks better than many that followed, it also sounds marvellous. It's wonderfully bright and vivid, it will appeal to viewers young and old.Up never gets tired, it's an outstanding, funny, moving and heart-warming movie.10/10.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","shanebuckland","4 November 2002","Carl Frederickson (Ed Asner) has lived a long life, but dreams of adventuring to South America. He wants to spend his remaining days in his home, but new high-rises are being constructed around it. After a chance accident, Carl loses his home, and is set to be taken into a retirement home. Unhappy with this idea, the former balloon salesman ties thousands of balloons to his house and simply floats away, en route to his dream adventure. Except, he is not alone – young ""wilderness explorer"" Russell (Jordan Nagai) inadvertently shows up in mid-air, and Carl sees no other choice but to bring the boy with him.The fact that this plot line is even relevant enough to get made into a movie is more than enough reason to praise Up. Ever since Toy Story, Pixar has consistently delivered the most radically original and unique ideas for animated films, and live action films. Sure, not all of them are as amazing as others (Cars is quite simply stale compared to the likes of Ratatouille and WALL-E), but there is something brilliantly imaginative and exciting going on at the studio, and Up is no exception.Coming off the breakthrough of WALL-E, I was not expecting the same reaction to Up, but I was more than just pleasantly surprised. The film is hilarious, heartfelt, moving and depressing all at once. This may sound like it is an issue, and that the film has a problem holding its ground with its tonal structure. But instead, it handles it quite well; splitting the film into quadrants and allowing the themes and plot line to coincide with whatever emotional response the filmmakers are going for. And while there is plenty for young children to enjoy and take from the film, it is the older audience that will get the biggest reaction from it. There is a lot going on in the film, but it never loses its speed and never loses control of what it wants to say and do. It knows exactly where it wants to be and when. And where other recent Pixar films have failed (specifically in their lengthy runtimes and frequent need to drag themselves out), Up does not. It practically blasts its way through its beginning, all the way up to its ending, with time left to spare.What makes Up work so well, much like WALL-E before it, is the focus on very few characters. Where WALL-E spent the majority of its runtime primarily on Earth with its main character, a love interest and a cockroach, Up spends its majority with Carl, Russell, a ""bird"" named Kevin and a talking dog named Dug (voiced by co-director Bob Peterson). It does allow for more characters to enter in later on, but the focus never strays from these main characters. Some may say the film is trying to tell multiple stories, but as the film progresses, it is clear it is telling one story – the tale of a man who never experienced what he wanted the most. The film builds up Carl's backstory heavily in startlingly moving moments that surprisingly were surprisingly kept rather secretive in the marketing for the film. We know from the very first trailer that Carl is a fairly mean old man, but the film spends a great deal of time to develop him into an emotional wreck of a man.But the real success of the film is in its imagination and adventure. While WALL-E is perhaps the most startlingly unique and original animated picture of the last decade, Up still manages to pack in a lot of uniqueness. But while WALL-E got caught up in its own environmentally sound message, Up sticks with being an almost straight adventure picture. It is frequently thrilling and exciting, and lets up only for a few moments at a time. For such an older character, the film really stuns with some of its fantastical ideas. Sure, it is obvious this is a film that could only ever be done as an animated film, but what it lacks in realism it makes up for in fun – something that has been sorely missing from the movies for years. It came back for a short while with the first Pirates of the Caribbean film, but the focus as of late for any film has been on deeply conflicted, depressing narratives. And while this film is struck with having some of the most depressing scenes the year has seen so far, it never wallows in the sadness. It throws the moments at you, and then quickly moves on. And as said previously, the tonal shifts work excellently in Up's favour.But of course, an animated movie cannot work without its animation. While Up is not a breakthrough in the way other Pixar films have been, it keeps with the tradition of still looking stunning and leading the curve for computer animated films. It does look cartoony and fantastical in many instances, but this only continues to work towards it being even better. The locales are realistic looking; the dog fur is near perfect. For me, watching Carl's facial hair gradually grow in as the story moves along was simply amazing. The little details and minute perfections have always been key to the Pixar films, and Up is no different. Additionally, the 3D effects really add a layer to the film, and bring the movie to life (unlike other recent efforts like Monsters vs. Aliens and Bolt).I cannot praise Up enough. Words cannot do justice for how excellent the film is. Pixar continues to outdo itself year after year, even with their subpar films. While each film has their own flaws, Up revels in being as close to perfect as the company has been in years. I adored every minute, and look forward to watching it again with an even bigger smile on my face.10/10.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Marshall-D-Teach","15 February 2020","What's up? Up is up! It was very successful movie! It even was nominated for Best Picture by the Academy Awards. It was the second animation film to do that. Directed by Pete Docter, Up is Pixar's tenth film in their series and their first full-length 3-D film. The film tells the story of an elderly widower named Carl Fredricksen (Voiced by Edward Asner) whom trying to fulfill his late wife's dream by taking their house to South America. The only problem is, that an earnest Boy Scout named Russell (Voiced by Jordan Nagai) has tagged along, making the simple trip, so much, more complex. Can Carl make it to South America or will his late wife's dreams be shattered? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found this movie to be very entertaining. The movie is gorgeous and colorful. Sadly, the 3D isn't worth it, but it's still, beautiful to the eyes. I love the amazing music by Michael Giacchino. I just wish, the tune sound more South or Latin American, than European, because it would make more sense. The movie is unsurprisingly well action part. Great pacing. The film is also well-acted. Everybody did their parts, very well. Edward Asner was a great choice as Mr. Fredricksen. I love his grumpiness in his voice. The use of mostly grunts, make it seem, like his responses come from a protective stance, rather than his own grouchy nature. Jordan Nagai as Russell is just as likable. He has the most lines, in the film, and none of it, sounds too annoying. I guess, there was something, sweet about his voice. You really do hear it, whenever, Russell speaks. I love that the actor wasn't even trying to get cast for the role, but end up, getting it, over his brother who was. It show, how charming, his voice is. The supporting cast's voice acting is just as memorable. Christopher Plummer as the villain, Charles Muntz, the explorer was fun to listen to. Bob Peterson as Dug, the dog, was pretty amazing. His voice in this, remind me so much of veteran voice actor, Dom DeLuise. I also love the cameo from Pixar's own favorite actor, John Ratzenberger in his minor role. As much as I love the voice acting; I really love, how the cartoon characters appear in this film. I like how, they have more child-like appealing cartoony look. The whole over the top celebrity caricatured facial appearances kinda works, because the older computer model for humans, used in Toy Story 1&2 are just way too bland-looking and unappeased. It has that creepy uncanny valley look to it. Anyways, I think, the new model gives the movie, the amount of surrealism to make the plot to work. I really doubt, the film could work, with more realistic facial appearances, because how bizarre, the premise is. While, the appearance of Carl is meant to resemble Spencer Tracy as he appeared in his final film, 1967's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. I like his short square status, and cartoony facial expressions. It makes Carl stand out. Unlike some critics, I also love, how Russell look. He doesn't look, like a kid with Down syndrome. He looks like a normal kid. I think, they were a little too harsh in their judgment. I also love the fact, that Russell is clearly Asian American, but his character lack the typical Asian over-stereotyping. Surprising, it makes the character, so much, more appealing, because it's not stepping over to over-used racial clichés. Charles F. Muntz really looks like, an old explorer, but his character's looks was a bit jarring. I really had a hard time, believing, that he's that well maintain, at his age, when he spent, most of the film, living for so long, outside of civilization. In my opinion, he should have, look, a little more broken-down. Last is Dug. He's a very realistic looking golden retriever. I own one, and they got it exactly right. I like how he closes his mouth and freezes when he notices a squirrel. Funny moment right there. For the story, it's both a hit and miss. I love that the film deals with more adult like drama, than childish antics. Having Carl still dealing with the loss of his wife, gave the movie, so much depth. It was really needed. However, besides the awesome and unexpected genuine tearjerker opening marriage montage, the film goes into another direction, with its absurdity. It's really off the wall, crazy and convenient, that Carl able to travel to South America in the way, he's traveling. The movie takes great artistic license, when it comes to engineering and physics. You have to really, be willing to suspension your disbelief from the rest of the entire film. Especially, when Russell was designed to be the child that Carl and his wife were unable to have, in both a figurative and literal spirit. Another thing, I didn't get about the plot, is how Charles Muntz can be, easily discredited. Clearly, the amount of what he found, in his short life, would give, his statements about the exotic bird, some credit. Clearly, much of the unexplainable questions in the plot, could be solve in the Carl is crazy theory that certain people has latch on. In theory, Carl didn't travel to South America, instead the Balloons are metaphors, reflecting Carl's happy and uplifting memories of his wife. Hints, why he was stubbornly clinging to them and refuses to let go, as if he's afraid he's going to fall. It wasn't until he did, was he able to live life, once more. Other people have notice, some themes similarity in the plot to John Milton's great poems Paradise Lost, Harvey Potter's Balloon Farm by Jerdine Nolen, and most of all, several really obvious references to Studio Ghibli. Overall: It deserve its good praise. A must-watch. Things can only go up from here.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Balibari","18 October 2004","This is another film in which it really helps to know in advance what it is, or more specifically, what it isn't. Then, you go from there. I enjoyed the animated film very much but, some of that was due to the fact a friend clued me in first, saying ""this isn't really a comedy or a film for little kids. Don't expect a ton of laughs."" So, instead of seeking laughs (although I still got them here and there), I just enjoyed the adventure story and marveled at the amazing artwork. Seen on Blu-Ray, this is yet another example in which you shake your head and wonder, ""How does the artwork get any better than this?"" Then, about six months from now, another will come along and I'll say the same thing. Overall movies may not be better today than ""in the old days,"" but there is no dispute there are two areas in which films keep getting better and better: special-effects and animation. This is another example of that.The colors and the detail in here are almost beyond description. The artwork ranges from bold to subdued, but always stunning. I lost track how many times I wanted to just pause and admire the picture for a few minutes. From super-sharp closeups of the old man's face to lush jungle scenery, this high-definition disc is worth every penny/Back to the story, I found it a combination adventure-fantasy-comedy-suspense-sentimental story, about in that order, too. Generally-speaking, I would think adults would like this more than kids, but I may be wrong. Everyone - regardless of age - will have their jaw drop more than once viewing the incredible-looking scenes. It's really a feast for the eyes. Finally, if you like extras, there are tons of them in the four-disc DVD set.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","JWick23","18 December 2020","Greetings again from the darkness. Another crackling collaboration of Pixar and Disney, and as expected, it is touching, funny, thrilling and amazing to look at and watch. Only a step below Toy Story just because it is not quite as ground-breaking, though the story is even better.While I love technology and effects, I am first and foremost a story guy when it comes to movies. This has as good of story as any film you will see. My only caution is that it seems geared towards grown-ups, not kids. The montage of Carl and Ellie growing old together is without dialogue and will probably bore some kids. Their parents certainly won't be bored; however, as it will resonate with most anyone over age 40 who hasn't taken the time to chase their childhood dreams.No question, this film is a barrage of color and eccentric characters, and can even be a bit frightening at times. Still, the key to this one are the stories and quests of the elderly Mr. Fredrickson and the young Russell, trying to earn his badge of honor. From the beginning, Disney has always had a finger on the pulse of youngsters. Here, we aren't given the usual Hollywood garbage of brainiac kids who make the adults look stupid. Instead we are given a pudgy, slightly goofy kid just trying to get his parents to take note.Special kudos to Ed Asner for bringing Mr. Fredrickson to life ... in good times and bad. He never goes overboard and is quite often absolutely perfect. Christopher Plummer has a limited role as bad guy Charles Muntz. Or is he really so bad? Cast aside by society, he has spent his life searching for redemption.I am not saying the kids won't enjoy, but I am saying make sure parents and grandparents tag along. You will be entertained, delighted and moved.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","rtsdynamite","28 July 2022","Seriously, I'm convinced, Pixar is maybe the only movie studio that is providing the best movies around. Who said that animated films can't be considered real movies? Can't be considered an art form? Up is the latest creation from Disney and Pixar, after last year's smash hit WALL-E, I felt like they couldn't at all top themselves and they did it again with this incredibly charming story. Admittingly from the trailer, I wasn't sure this story was going to work as well, but I got the opportunity to see Up this week and was just totally blown away by it's story, animation and characters. The thing I adore about these movies that Disney and Pixar are creating is that they're not just for the kids, but the adults as well, this is something that I could even see an adult seeing by themselves. This story doesn't insult kid's intelligence and is extremely entertaining for anyone to enjoy, to go through this adventure with an old man who just wanted to make his wife happy.Carl Fredricksen, a quiet young boy, meets Ellie in her clubhouse, discovering together they share the same interest in exploration as their hero, famed explorer Charles F. Muntz. Ellie expresses her desire to move her clubhouse to Paradise Falls in South America, a promise she makes Carl keep. Carl and Ellie fall in love, wed and grow old together in the old house where they first met. Ellie dies of old age before they can take their trip, leaving Carl living alone in their home. After a tussle with a construction worker over Carl's broken mailbox, the court orders Carl to move into a retirement home. Carl comes up with a scheme to keep his promise to Ellie, and creates a makeshift airship using thousands of helium balloons which lift his house off its foundation. Russell, a Wilderness Explorer trying to earn his ""Assisting the Elderly"" badge, has stowed away on the porch after being sent on a snipe hunt by Carl the day before. After a storm throws them around for a while, they find themselves across a large ravine facing Paradise Falls. With their body weight providing ballast allowing Carl and Russell to pull the floating house, the two begin to walk around the ravine. As they walk towards Paradise Falls, Russell finds a colorful tropical bird which he names Kevin, not realizing that the bird is actually female. They later run into a dog with a translating collar named Dug. They discover Dug's owner is Charles Muntz, who has remained in South America for several decades to find a bird like Kevin in order to restore his reputation after bringing back a skeleton and being called a fraud. Though Carl is initially thrilled to meet his hero, when he realizes that Muntz is after Kevin and will kill to obtain her, Carl takes steps to save the bird and escape from Muntz.Up is seriously the best movie I have seen so far this year, it's actually one of my favorite movies of all time, I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this film. Wither it was the fun and charming story between Carl and Russell, the crazy bird Kevin, or the story that nearly killed me in laughter, the dogs that have collars that make them talk. I don't remember the last time a movie that made me laugh so hard that my stomach hurt, it also made me tear up and smile. If someone ever tells you that an animated film can't be considered a real movie, just show them Up. I absolutely adore this movie, can't wait for it to come out on DVD and watch it again. This is a perfect family film, actually scratch that, it's a perfect film, the animation is incredible, the characters are lovable and the story is magical. Up is going to be a film to be remembered for all time, great movie, go see it.10/10","

Truth is I really should have made the time before.Although I enjoy all the other Disney/pixar movies, I am at that teenage age where I mainly seek Violence, sex and gore. Thankfully my teenage boredom did me a big favour in helping what this fantastic masterpiece. This film was so fantastically deep, meaningful and moving beyond relief, as soon as I switched it off I rang my grandparents to tell them I love them.It should be made necessary that everyone everywhere should see this film and I think the world would be a much better place - it really is that good.100/10","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Foxbarking","2 May 2005","If there's a list of great computer animation movies of all time, Pixar would dominate most of the top positions. Great story, great voice talent, great timing, great for all ages. It'd be hard to pick just one above another and perhaps another viewing of Up may be in order to figure out where I'd place it among so much stellar work.Up is by far the most emotional human drama of any Pixar movies thus far, very heavy, so much so if you're looking for pure fun with some jaw-dropping chase and/or thematic scenes and no downer moments, Up may not be for you. I saw it in a packed theatre of about a 65% adult, 35% adult split audience and it's the only time I can remember being in ANY animated movie where there was sniffles and watery eyes, and that was within the first 10 minutes of the movie. There's an undercurrent of life after losing a loved one in this movie, which I don't feel gives anything away. It's pretty heavy subject matter, Pixar handles it, like they do everything they touch, incredibly well, but it doesn't make it any less sad to have the material threaded throughout much of the movie you're reminded of it, but I suppose it's up to one's own interpretation of loss and how to place it in your life that perhaps will have an emotional effect on you.Story is what makes a great movie great. Without story, you don't really have anything, maybe some effects, some action, maybe some cute or clever sight gags, maybe some laughs, hopefully some emotion, where Pixar shines above all others in animation and over a good 99% of the movies out there is they can intertwine it all and do it seemingly effortless, which is an incredible feat. To do this in a few movies is one thing, but Pixar has pretty much nailed this now for their entire career of making movies, that's just simply unprecedented. I should note I saw the 3D version which, to be honest, didn't really take the movie to the next level. One of the more well known syndicated reviewers had said you're better off seeing the non-3D version on screen, and I actually agree. The 3D glasses added little to nothing to the movie except for an eye-strain headache later in the night. It didn't take away from Up mind you, it just didn't add to it either. Up is a great movie either way you slice it and it should be noted, the theatre I saw it in gave it a fairly loud round of applause at the end. It's pretty rare these days that an audience applauds after a movie, perhaps we as a society has become too jaded, or too just expecting of the goods or feeling we're entitled to the entertainment. It's nice when a movie hits on all cylinders and elicits such a range and emotional reaction people who don't know each other in a packed room all gasp, laugh, cry, and applaud together. Great movies however can do that and Up is truly a great movie.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Matti-Man","24 January 2005","UP, Pixar's latest animated feature, is just delightful. But how do you go about extolling the movie's virtues without giving away its surprises? Like the kid at the beginning of the movie, you don't try to conquer the immovable force; you work around it.The one clue I can give away – because it's the movie's heavily hyped premise – is that Carl Fredrickson, a gruffy old widower (voiced with gruffy old charm by Ed Asner), miraculously inflates enough balloons to use his house as an aircraft. Soon, he finds himself reluctantly sharing his ride with a short-attention-spanned kid named Russell.I'll also mention a couple of other items that can gauge your potential interest in the movie. One is a gag that is a take-off on a famous painting – perhaps too inside of an inside joke, but typical of Pixar's cheery attempts to appeal to viewers of all ages.Also, part of the plot involves Carl's long-held wish to meet a Lindbergh-type adventurer named Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer!). This is another in-joke that's even vaguer than the first one. Cartoon historians know that Walt Disney started in the cartoon biz by creating Oswald the Rabbit for producer Charles Mintz, who then greedily stole the rights to Disney's creation. This gives you a pretty good idea where the ostensible hero Muntz stands in the scheme of things.Beyond that, I can only offer you some enticing clues about the characters. There's a dog who's the leader of his pack and in menacing beyond measure, until he opens his mouth and gets one of the movie's biggest laughs. There's a huge, awkward bird that is a big laugh-getter at first. Then she becomes a real enough character that – at least in the audience I was in – when she's injured, she elicits screams of fright worthy of Bambi's late mother.There's surprising, heartfelt emotion, vivid imagery (you can almost touch the landscapes and skies), and a music score by Michael Giacchino that's practically a character in the movie – particularly in a thoughtful montage that takes Carl from childhood to widowhood.There aren't many (or at least not enough) live-action movies that are engrossing as this cartoon. Pixar Studios has gotten to be one of those movie icons that shouldn't even have to deliver a premise to get funded anymore. The moneymen should just shut up, hand over the money, and trust they'll get a product that will appeal to everyone.UP is only the second Pixar feature to get a PG rating, only for mildly intense imagery and action – nothing off-color in the least. Again, if you can handle ""Bambi,"" this film should be a breeze.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","kraley","4 October 2002","This lovely film tells the story of Carl Fredrickson, a little friendly widower who lives alone in a house restored along with his late wife, Ellie, whose memory he cherishes constantly. Forced to leave his home, threatened by real-estate interests, to live in a nursing home where he didn't want to go, Carl decides to go on a long journey that always wanted to do with his wife but that life never allowed... and departs with your home through a system that he created and that makes it fly. But the journey is bound to change radically when he meets the scout Russell, eight-year-old, grabbed on his porch, an unwitting passenger on that trip.Directed by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson, two brilliant directors of Pixar Animation Studio behind hits like ""Wall-e"", ""Monsters Inc."" or ""Finding Nemo"", this film has a number of experienced voices and a touching soundtrack, which earned the Academy Award that year for Best Original Score. A curious fact: the place represented as a destination point for Carl's trip - the fictional Paradise Falls - exists on the real life, in the border between Venezuela and Brazil: its Mount Roraima.The most touching on this film is to see the love of Carl and Ellie, alive even after her death and visible in the way he keeps her memory alive and ever present. Russell's goodness also move us, especially when he is confronted with the harsh ways of stubborn Carl, who sees in Russell a problem. Another deeply moving character is Dough, a friendly and affectionate dog who speaks through a device placed on his leash.For all these things, ""Up"" is a film for the whole family, is a film that touches us, moves us and thrills. It proves that, if love cannot move mountains can still move homes, and that no one is too old to live an adventure or fulfill a dream.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","minimeltheminx","11 October 2004","One of the best Pixar movies, the beginning of the movie makes anyone cry even if they turn them from your stone, and do not cry from any movie. The beginning of the movie and the movie stars were excellent. I'm really sympathetic to Carl. Rarely is a cartoon character well written in a target for children. The story of the movie was excellent, the message of the movie was, and I feel that the movie made me feel the magic of the Disney films that I missed a lot, the evil of the film was disappointing and was not convincing unlike the rest of the bad guys at Pixar and Disney, my rating for the movie is 9.2","

"SPIRITED AWAY","TheLittleSongbird","5 April 2010","As I am much more hesitant to give a movie a score of 10 than most reviewers, take my score of 9 as a ringing endorsement for this sweet CGI film from Pixar. In addition, the film is the first 3-D film by the studio and it looked lovely.The film begins with a sweet but VERY emotionally draining prologue. You see Carl Fredricksen as a very young boy along with his first two loves--the adventures of the explorer, Charles Muntz, and his meeting and falling in love with Ellie. All this is done with a minimum of dialog and it is one of the sweetest segments I've seen in years--and is a first for something this deep and emotional from a computer generated film. Keep a few Kleenex nearby--you'll likely need it.Then, the film jumps ahead to the present day. Carl is now elderly and alone. His life is quite sad and he dwells on the recent loss of Ellie. Fortunately, the film doesn't dwell on this too long or become maudlin--though it did come a bit close at times. Now, with nothing in his life other than memories AND the court pushing him into a retirement home against his will, Carl comes up with a crazy plan--to float his home away with a bazillion balloons and take it to South America!! Unfortunately, while the plan works, Carl also gets an unwelcome passenger (Russell). Now Russell is an absolutely adorable character--wonderfully rendered and with a fittingly cute voice. You cannot help but love him. But, since Carl is alone and childless and grumpy, he is less than enthralled with this hitchhiker.Eventually, they arrive in South America and meet some new friends--a bizarre giant bird and Dug, the dog. But, being a family film, you KNOW that there must be some villain and sure enough, along comes a very, very, very elderly Muntz who seems a tad...""touched"". This sets off some very hair-raising adventures and you'll just need to tune it to see what happens next.Technically speaking, this film was incredible and shows that the same old software is NOT being used but a newer generation with greater clarity and richness. I loved how through the course of the film, for instance, Carl's beard stubble starts to slowly grow in as well as the lovely shading and colors. While I loved RATATOUILLE and WALL-E for their animation, this looked a lot better--plus came in 3-D. I just saw Dreamworks' latest film the week before (MONSTERS VS. ALIENS) and frankly UP looked immensely better--there was just no comparison.As for the story, it was highly imaginative and strange--in a good way. I can only think of one other film that is like UP at all, and that is the wonderful French live action film, LE PAPILLON. It, too, is about an elderly single man who has an adorable child dumped in his lap and like UP, by the end of the film the old man has essentially been adopted by the kid. Both are rather predictable in that sense, but both also make it work due to brilliant writing, adorable kids and plot elements that are very unique and magical. Heck, in UP, the many dogs in the film can talk AND are excellent chefs--where have you ever seen that before?! Overall, it's a great film for almost all ages. I did notice in the theater that one kid (about 4) got very, very, very upset when the cute bird was captured--and he screamed and cried for some time. Keep this in mind if you do take young kids to see it--it may elicit come tears though there is no dirty language and the violence is mostly mild. For Pixar, this is among their best.","

An old man as a protagonist? It definitely blew my expectations. The first 5 minutes demolished every other Pixar feature just because it was the first time I cried in a theater.This just shows how much heart there is to the movie. I really don't want to get into specifics because of spoilers but the movie literally has everything.Amazing visual effects.Amazing sound.Hilarious comedy.Breath taking action.Heart.All those combined equal something special. Today's movies like to blow you away with gimmicks, Pixar is different. Each movie shows soul and UP definitely has it.I can't wait until it comes out so I can see it in 3d, im bringing everybody.10/10","

"SPIRITED AWAY","classicsoncall","15 August 2012","Viewed at the Festival de Cannes 2009 The opening film of this year's festival, and the first animated film ever to have this honour, Up is truly a film for all ages. The story of the adventures of an old man and a young boy, a flying house tethered to countless balloons, a long-lost (and mad) explorer, a giant bird called Kevin and assorted 'talking' dogs gets funnier and more exciting as it goes along.This isn't slapstick humour, although there are some lovely visual gags, but deeper, more thoughtful. At times Up is even touching and poignant.Visually, this is a treat and while I was sceptical about the use of 3D to begin with, it is built into the story so seamlessly that it really is worth the effort to seek it out. At the same time, I can't help feeling the 2D version could be even better because the 3D glasses had the effect of dimming the picture. The use of colour in the film is especially noteworthy, with various palettes used according to mood, character and phase of the story. Character voicing and music are also spot on.I have no connection with Pixar, Disney or the film whatsoever, even if this review reads like a puff piece. The fact is, Up is an incredible piece of cinema, was a big hit with a very demanding press audience, and is worthy of your time and money.Anyone who says animated films cannot amuse and entertain, while at the same time delivering any kind of emotion, does not know what they are talking about.Up is so good I can now forgive Pixar for Cars!","

"SPIRITED AWAY","WeAreLive","30 March 2020","If Pixar - as a studio - has any weakness, it's that they have no idea how to make a bad film. Again and again they release entertaining movies with not only a terrific sense of humor, but a level of storytelling that has set a standard for today's films, animated or otherwise. While I was obviously extremely excited to see Up, never did I expect it - or, to be honest, anything else from this year - to reach the level of quality of this year's first animated film, Coraline (which, along with last year's Bolt and Wall-E, became one of my favorite films of all time). Well, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Simply put, Up is a perfect movie.Easily the most emotionally impactful portion of the entire film, the first ten to fifteen minutes of Up are nothing short of beautiful. Using little to no dialogue, the opening ""montage"" of this film tells the story of Carl and his wife Ellie, and the wonderful life that they share together. Carl is such a lovable character, that you feel for him from the very beginning. Without trying to come off as cliché or anything, you feel the joy that he feels, and when his wife passes away, you feel his loss. By the end of the whole sequence, I was in tears.This movie is freakin' hilarious. Without a doubt the funniest film that Pixar has ever made, each and every character in Up provides their own bit of humor. Dug the dog (voiced by co-director Bob Peterson) is especially hilarious every single time that he ""opens his mouth"", and yet still proves to be a key part of this emotional roller coaster ride. The movie also does a terrific job at making you feel a sense of wonder, and you just buy into the adventure of these two characters. Finally, I want to give a special nod to Christopher Plummer as the famous wilderness explorer, Charles Muntz, who is easily my favorite Pixar villain.I love Up. Go see it now, as my review just can't do it justice. Not only is it extremely entertaining, but also gut-bustingly hilarious, and beautifully told throughout. To quote John Campea of TheMovieBlog.com, ""The only negative thing I have to say about this movie is that it ended."" The result is a film that's on par with Wall-E and The Incredibles as my favorite Pixar movie to date (which, again, is saying a hell of a lot, considering that they're two of my top 10 favorite films of all time) and while it may take a couple more viewings to say for certain, I have no qualms with saying that Up is one of the finest films I've ever seen.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","sailvane-1","12 January 2005","What can I say about Pixar? Amazing?? Perfect?? Got to see this at the Cannes Film Festival in France (went on a trip with my family) and Pixar gives us another instant classic: Up.The movie focuses on 78-year old man Carl Fredrickson's (voiced by Edward Asner) life who always had a dream of going on a journey to South American to see the wilds of it. He buys thousands of balloons just to attach it to his house to float up in the sky. So, he starts with his journey up in the sky in his house with balloons attached to it. Suddenly, he's not alone and somebody's at the door while flying, it's a boy scout kid named Russell. He invites the boy with him on his journey to South America.Just brilliant and simple story-telling, beautiful visuals as usual with Pixar, awesome voice work, funny and smart dialogue, beautiful score once again by Michael Giacchino & very, very enjoyable characters. Speaking of characters, the highlight of the film: Dug the Dog. A sort of ""robot"" dog that will have you have you in a lot of stitches each scene that dog is in and that was the case with me. Simply, one of the funniest characters Pixar ever made. Pete Doctor, one of the four Pixar directors (John Lassester, Andrew Stanton, Brad Bird) who directed Monster's Inc (2001) needs and should get nominated for his clever, genius and smart directing of this but if Stanton didn't get the nods for (Finding Nemo and WALL-E) and Bird for (The Incredibles & Ratatouille) which they should of been, then the Oscars are making another HUGE mistake for not nominating this guy for this movie.Up is the funniest Pixar movie, funnier than the Toy Story movies, A Bug's Life & Finding Nemo which were the funniest, in my opinion. The movie is not just hilarious, it's emotional and sad at times. Like WALL-E, it focuses on the character feelings but not as magical as WALL-E. Still, Up is full of emotional, fun and hilarious proportions. Your in for a BIG ride in this!! 10/10.","

When he meets the girl Ellie, who also worships Munts, they become close friends. However Charles Munts falls in disgrace, accused of forging the skeleton of the monster of Paradise Falls, and he travels in his blimp to South America to bring the monster alive and he is never seen again. Carl and Ellie get married and they promise to each other to travel together to Paradise Falls and build a house there. Many years later, Ellie dies and the lonely Carl refuses to move from their house despite the offers of the owner of a construction company. When Carls hits one worker that damaged his box-mail, he is sentenced to move to a retirement home. However, he uses many balloons to float his house and travel to Paradise Falls. While floating, he finds that the boy Russell, who is in the Wilderness Explorer Training trying to get his assisting the elderly badge to be promoted to senior, is a stowaway on board. They travel together to South America where Russell finds a weird bird that he names Kevin and the talking dog Doug. Then they meet the insane villain Charles Munts that spent his life in the forest trying to catch Kevin with his talking dogs. But Carl and Russell decide to protect Kevin and they have the adventure of their lives. ""Up"" is a surrealistic adventure full of sentiments, where the heroes are an old widower and an annoying fat boy. The first point that impresses is how touching this story is with the dramatic situation of the elder Carl after losing his beloved Ellie, lonely and forgotten by the world that is changing. I slightly recalled the situation of Walt Kowalski, performed by Clint Eastwood in ""Gran Torino"". The annoying Russell is responsible for most of the funniest sequences, especially those with Kevin and the talking dog Doug. There are many details and layers in this beautifully sad tale. Further, it is also impressive how Disney and Pixar succeed in releasing one excellent movie after another like ""Wall-e"" or ""The Incredibles"". My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Up – Altas Aventuras"" (""Up – High Adventures"")","

"SPIRITED AWAY","A_Kind_Of_CineMagic","31 October 2013","""Up"" is a winner, and I couldn't be less surprised. Anyone still putting a limit on how new and inventive they think a Pixar film can be deserves to have their socks blown off. For the rest of us, just buy a ticket and expect to be taken away. This new flick is the work of writers/directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson, two guys who have each been around the making of Pixar flicks before. Docter was a director on ""Monsters Inc"", a writer on ""Toy Story"" and a co-writer and director on ""Wall*E."" Peterson was a writer on ""Finding Nemo"". Both know the guidelines for success and while ""Up"" doesn't reach the heights of say a ""Wall*E"" or a ""Toy Story"", it's still a fantastic movie because, well, I don't think the people Pixar hires know how to make anything other than fantastic movies.This one is about Carl Fredericksen (Edward Asner), a 78-year old retired balloon salesman living alone in a house full of old memories. Carl and his wife Ellie met each other as young children, both enamored by the newsreels about adventurer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). They eventually married and planned on seeing the world together, especially Paradise Falls in South America, but life kept getting in the way and before he knew it, Ellie died.As the world changes, Carl refuses to change with it. When developers threaten to move him out of his house and into a retirement home, the old codger rigs his house up with thousands of balloons and before you can say ""way to go Carl"", he floats away, determined to have the adventure he and his wife never had. He doesn't plan on taking 8-year old chubby wilderness explorer Russell (Jordan Nagai) with him or crash landing on the other side of Paradise Falls, or finding an exotic female snipe (that Russell names Kevin) or a group of talking dogs (one named Dug befriends them) tracking down the bird for Muntz, who it turns out is a sinister villain, but things kinda turn out that way.You're grabbed instantly. The adorable opening montage of the Carl and Ellie love story is more endearing and moving in its dialogue-less 10-minute entirety than any other romance this year by a long shot. This is another Pixar flick that goes in a daring direction. We next see Carl as a heartbreaking old man, his wife dead and the world no longer needing him. You forgive him his bitterness and you love him for the sentimental streak he has towards the things he and his wife shared together. His crabbiness is a little funny but there are also some heavy scenes early on as well. It sets up a beautiful, multi-layered story about enduring love and learning to live life without limits.When a thrilling rainstorm crashes Carl and Russell on the other side of Paradise Falls, the two must each harness themselves to the house floating above them. The characters each look terrific and share a good chemistry. Russell is the usual 8-year old kid, talkative, inquisitive, and annoyingly overeager. He is a good comic foil to crabby Carl, his big, rosey smile and plump round stature a counter to the stout, frowningly square-faced Carl. As the two spend more time together, a wonderfully written friendship develops.The movie is full of visual gags and the talking dog-henchmen are great fun. Muntz, an adventurer who travels around the world in a big blimp, offers a menacingly evil villain to chase Carl and Russell through rough mountainous terrain before the exciting final house vs. blimp in-air showdown. Plus the movie looks fantastic, a lush array of candy color and grand scenery. And the vocal cast, from Edward Asner to Christopher Plummer and Jordan Nagai each deftly voice their roles. ""Up"" is one of the year's rare treasures, a movie that flies in every way possible and from Pixar, you shouldn't expect anything less.","

Heartfelt throughout, aesthetically romantic and emotionally lasting, the only negative is perhaps there is about 20-30 minutes where the movie becomes a bit of a drag featuring the antagonist. To this day, the beginning of the film is one of my most memorable cinema experience.","

He has guilt over the adventure they planned but never got to take. When his house is condemned he plots to sail away with the house and take the home he and Ellie shared . Enter Boy Scout Russell trying to earn his help the elderly badge.You can pretty much guess Russell ends up going along even if neither of them planned it. In spite of his determination not to Carl ends up caring about Russell . There is a funny, sweet bird , a lovable robot dog and a treacherous villain who all come into play .When Carl reads Ellie's scrapbook he sees she considered their whole life together an adventure and she wants him to have another one . He's finally able to move on .For some reason many mainly like the first part of the movie but to me the whole thing is special and it wouldn't be the same without sweet little Russell.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","paul_mampilly","27 September 2003","I was lucky enough to get a ticket to a special pre-release screening of Up at Pixar studios in Emeryville, organized by the San Francisco Film Society. After a hour-long reception in the atrium of their beautiful main building we went through some rigorous security (metal detectors!) and were treated to an hilarious short (Partly Cloudy) and Pixar's new high water mark, Up.My favorites to date have definitely been Wall-E and the Incredibles, and Up is another slightly-left-of-center masterpiece. The emotional impact of the beautiful, wordless summation of Carl's life that opens the movie is the bass note that resonates through the whole film and is at least as affecting as the scene in Wall-E when he holds his own hands while watching Hello Dolly. The rest of the movie, of course, is breathtaking on just about every level, especially the tactile quality of all the characters and textures and the completely realized weather effects and action scenes. With no ""new"" technical milestones (fur in Monsters, Inc., water in Finding Nemo, realistic camera effects in Wall- E), the design is the main focus, from the hilariously stylized characters to the amazing setting of the tepui.As the associate producer who participated in the Q&A following the movie pointed out, the past three Pixar movies have not been easy sells to their parent company Disney (they'll be back in familiar territory with Toy Story 3 and Cars 2), but Pixar's commitment to inventive, story-driven films continues to pay off here. All of the good press is true, and I can't wait to see it again. Thanks for staying true to yourselves Pixar!","

The first 15 minutes of this movie is a masterpiece in storytelling. Nobody can tell me otherwise. I think literally every single time my mom has watched it she has cried. I don't cry during movies, but there are a couple things that definitely get me close... and the first 15 mins is one of them. The rest of the movie is a super fun adventure and is one of the funniest Pixar films to date. The kid, the bird, the dogs, all great. The message the film implies is also very important and sadly true for all. Watched this so much as a kid, and can't wait to show it to my kids.

"SPIRITED AWAY","badtothebono","24 November 2005","Sadly, there aren't enough superlatives in the English language with which to laud Up, the latest offering from the folks at Disney/Pixar. This is quite simply the best movie of any genre to emerge thus far this year. No small praise considering how I've long been adverse to ""kids movies"", pegging them as being shallow, vapid, and simplistic - a personal preconception which Pixar mercifully shattered with 2004's The Incredibles and 2008's WALL-E, which proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that for all their acclaim as an animation studio, they are equally brilliant story tellers Up tells the story of Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner), who as a child meets Ellie, later to become the love of his life. Carl and Ellie find they share a common dream – to one day visit Paradise Falls, a mysterious tropical oasis in South America made famous in vintage newsreels chronicling the exploits of explorer/adventurer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). Life, however, manages to get in the way as the two grow up, get married, experience the pain of miscarriage, and eventually grow old, so much so that father time catches up on Ellie, leaving Carl a widower. All of this is conveyed with little dialog in a masterful sequence that had the audience, old and young alike, sniffling throughout.If you're thinking this isn't the usual stuff you see in ""kids movies"" you're right. But all credit is due to Pixar and the directorial and writing team of Pete Docter and Bob Peterson for realizing that children aren't idiots, and can handle complex, often tragic stories, if conveyed in the proper manner. It's a refreshing change from the over-protective mentality that once saw all hints of violence edited out of Warner Bros/Looney Tunes cartoons.In Up, characters bleed, there's implied murder, and it's all counter-balanced with some of the most delightfully twisted humor that's as inspired as anything the Zucker brothers ever came up with. The story literally had me careening from being misty-eyed to laughing heartily, frequently in the span of minutes.Faced with forced relocation to a retirement home, Carl opts for one final gambit, to fly his house down to Paradise Falls with the aid of a multitude of helium-filled balloons affixed to the roof of his house. Along for the ride is Russell (Jordan Nagai), a Wilderness Scout seeking to add a merit badge to his collection. Eventually the duo are complimented by Dug (voiced by co-director and writer Bob Peterson) a dopey derelict dog equipped by the now aged Muntz with a translator collar that converts dog thoughts to English.Like WALL-E, Up manages to imbue its characters with depth and humanity, while at the same time tell a story that is mature, delightful, and most of all, terrifically funny. In an era when Hollywood seems only capable of re-boots and do-overs, Up is not merely a refreshing stroke of original brilliance, it is likely the best movie you will see all year.... or until Pixar emerges with their next effort.","

Carl Fredericksen must be not only the best character created by Pixar, but also one of the best movie characters ever made in the story of cinema.Up is funny, exciting, both heartwarming and heartbreaking, but filled with a message of optimism, that makes the film highly enjoyable, even the saddest parts of the story. I never liked so much a film as this one. I can clearly see why most of the reviews were so good: ""Up"" it's a masterpiece that deserves everyone's appreciation. Everything about this is perfect: The music, the animation, the story, the charactersAll is great.""Up"" is easily the best movie of the 2009, and it is the best film of the last decade.

"SPIRITED AWAY","kellokchu","27 June 2019","Some, and you know who you are if you're reading this, may come across the IMDb page for Pixar's Up (and no, it's not Up! with an exclamation point, as that belongs to the 1976 Russ Meyer X-rated flick), and turn your nose up at it as just another Disney and/or Pixar kids flick. ""An old man with balloons tied to his house flying around with an annoying kid, not enough ""art"" for my taste"" (or something similar to that if not as snobbish). I want to relay an example for you that may get you excited: this is for Pixar a riff on Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo. You might remember that crazy little movie where Klaus Kinski, a dreamer obsessed with opera, decides he has to build an opera house in the middle of the South American jungle, so in order to accomplish this he has to drag his big freighter-ship across a mountain to the other side. It is a leap of faith, but we take it because it's led by a filmmaker with a compelling sense of telling a story with an equally compelling protagonist. Balloons tied to a house, ship across a mountain, not much difference if you ask me, just the degree of the ambition.But it's not enough to compare it to Herzog, or even really try to. Pixar's Up, directed by Pete Doctor, is original in its intent to make a serious adventure movie that starts off as something quite mature, makes it big leap to kids, and then straddles that line like that guy who crossed the twin towers on the tightrope in the 70s. Take your adjective, this is beautiful, audacious, heartbreaking, heartrending, sublime, hilarious, surreal, inventive film-making, and it doesn't talk down to any age group in its story of an old man, Carl Frederickson, who fulfills his and his late-wife's dream of having a house on a hilltop called Paradise Falls that their favorite explorer as kids flew to in South America. If you're a kid you'll not get any tasteless jokes (there's one poo joke that actually works since it's brief and, dare I say it, funny as hell), and it helps to get you prepared for some of the hardships that may come in life, like, well, the possibility of not having kids and losing your loved one in old age. Rare does it happen that you'll cry in the first ten minutes of a Disney family film anymore. Here's the rarity.Up is also in the tradition of wild fantasy, like a tale out of the Lost World mixed in with a tale out of Pixar's idols, Studio Ghibli. One could definitely see the kinds of characters like Carl, Russel and the hero-turned-villain explorer Charles Muntz in a Miyazaki film (as Ebert so thankfully noted in his review), but they also remain true to the Pixar tradition that's given them their distinction. They're never card-board cut-outs, and even when faced with certain plot elements reminiscent of Disney fare, such as with the big bird, ""Kevin"", in the jungle they have to help get back to her kids, or the (insane/perfect) comic relief of the dogs that talk with the collars around their necks, its dealt with the kind of love and care that should be given in solid storytelling. Nothing is too frivolous in Up, and there's an undercurrent of sadness to both Carl, for what he's lost and has to achieve without his late wife he's known since childhood, and for Russell lacking a father figure or real mother (this last part is handled really well, watch for ""Phyllis"" mentioned).Oh, and I forgot, it's animated in the usual tradition of Pixar fare: awesomely. Following on the heels of their arguable top-top masterpiece WALL-E, Up features the ordinary (inside a house, an old man) and the extraordinary (the birds, the dogs, the juxtaposition of a floating house with an airship, something else out of say Howl's Moving Castle) with delicacy and subtly while at the same time grandiosity and the vibrancy possible in the medium. I could go on and on, about how howlingly funny it is or how touching it is in the little moments. But make no mistake, Up is modern film art, even if it doesn't fit into your local art-house cinema. Take the (well-behaved/respectful) kids, take the old folks, take your rotten punk kid. It is what it is- squirrel! Good stuff.","

This is exactly what we experienced with ""Up"", a positive film that reflects the times we live, and the sense of fantasy in all of us, told in simple terms, but packing a message of hope about humanity.""Up"", the Pixar creation of 2009 offers a magnificent entertainment for audiences of all ages. The minds behind this animated film were in the right places as they offered us their view of a fantastic voyage to an unknown world that only lived in the imagination of an older man, who in spite of his advanced age, decided to take the road to the unknown because he is at the end of his life and the world in which he lives is not what he once knew. With the help of a boy, he does what he could not have been able to pursue when his beloved wife was still around. The prospect of living his last days in one of those institutions that cater to the old, the sick and the infirm, Carl Fredricksen opts for an escape. His beloved house serves as the vehicle where he will reach the Paradise Falls in South America. Unknown to him, Russell, the boy scout wanting to get another badge for assisting the elderly, comes along for a trip to the unknown. Little did he know the dangers he and Russell will have to face while at their destination, battling the egotistical explorer that once was his idol. Because of his determination, and with the help of Russell, he ends up being the real hero of the story, having escaped the indignities of the stay in the nursing home.Pete Docter and Bob Peterson directed ""Up"" using the Pixar amazing technology of animation. Mr. Docter the director of ""Monsters Inc."", also contributed to the screenplay. It the first time Mr. Petersen, a writer, had been involved in directing. Both men show a great talent for working in a medium that presents challenges for even the most experienced men trying to work in it.Ed Asner's voice is heard as Mr. Fredriksen. It is to the actor's credit to have given his character a human quality that perhaps with another actor would not have the same results. Jordan Nagai lent his voice to Russell, the boy with rare qualities hard to find these days. Christopher Plummer is perfect as the famous Charles Muntz. ""Up"" is an excellent film that will give pleasure to all kinds of audiences as it wants to appeal to the child quality hidden, perhaps, in all of us.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","ehy2k","25 May 2004","Young Carl idolised explorer Charles Muntz (who somehow looks a lot like Kirk Douglas) and his discovery of Paradise Falls somewhere in South America. Others regarded him as a quack and a fake, so Muntz disappeared. Carl wanted to be an adventurer, he met young Ellie who was even more adventurous but real life got in the way. Now Ellie has passed and Carl is a grumpy old man living alone, hounded by property developers who are bull dozing the neighbourhood and want to see him in a retirement home.Carl has tied his house with loads of helium balloons to float to Paradise Falls. He manages to take with him, an unwitting boy scout Russell who was just helping out an elderly person for a badge.Both find adventures including a rare bird, talking dogs and a fallen hero. More importantly Carl finds a yearning for life as he hangs out with young Russell who himself is freindless.I ended up viewing this film as my wife took our kids to the cinema to watch this and upon her return she told me that I would end being like Carl went I am older. I guess it is a roundabout way of telling me that I am a grouch!The film starts with a segment of Carl and Ellie from childhood to old age. It is the junior Carl who is shy, slightly awkward, a pace or two behind the frenetic and energetic Ellie. As life goes on, they could not have children and it is Ellie who slows down as they get older and she passes on, leaving Carl on his own.It is all about Carl rediscovering that zest for life and having that adventure he and Ellie dreamt about all those years ago. This is a fun and imaginative film, slightly surreal and off beat. For a film called UP it actually keeps its feet on the ground in terms of story and emotion.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","electronmove","21 March 2022","Films like Up, with computer-generated animation that captures every tiny human gesture and expression while still presenting a parody of the face and body, are so far removed from traditional animation that they might as well be given a genre of their own. That's not intended to denigrate the work of the likes of Pixar, but simply to point out that what we have here isn't so much another form of animation as another form of non-human images. Where Up! loses the kind of warmth human animators were capable of drawing into their characters, it redeems itself by delivering an emotionally-anchored tale of adventure that relies heavily on it's lead character's melancholy state of mind to keep the audience on board. To this end, Up! is more of an adult's film with elements added to keep the kids entertained rather than the other way around, which is usually the case with films like this.Ed Asner voices the character of Carl Friedrickson, a lonely old man who misses the recently deceased wife he has been with since childhood. He also regrets that they never managed to embark on the kind of adventures they dreamed about when watching newsreel of famous explorer Charles Muntz. All this is shown in an opening vignette that will nail the viewer's backside to their seat more firmly than an entire tub of superglue. Threatened with eviction to an old people's home, Carl decides to launch his house into the sky with the help of 20,000 helium-filled balloons and drift away to Paradise Falls in South America, which was the dream destination of his late wife. Things don't go quite to plan when Carl discovers he has a stowaway on board in the rotund form of Russell, some kind of wildlife ranger who just needs his 'Help the Elderly' badge to become a senior wildlife ranger.Beneath the adventure is the rather less exciting message that it's OK to live a life of ordinariness and routine, and that a life lived with the right person is a journey and adventure in itself (Not quite sure I'm inclined to agree when I'm stuck in a five mile traffic jam on the A428 or washing the dishes, but I'll let that one go). As Russell says, with an innocent insight that belies his youth, it's the small stuff you miss when it's no longer available to you, like sitting on the kerb with your dad, eating ice cream and counting red and blue cars.The film looks incredible, almost to the point that you're drawn away from the story at times to gawp at the growing stubble on the old guy's chin, or the fur on the talking dogs that form the old and embittered Muntz's guard. It isn't really intended to be an out-and-out comedy – it certainly isn't simply out to get as many laughs as it can – but there are a few laugh-out-loud moments and a refreshing lack of sentimentality despite it's essentially emotive subject matter. Definitely worth an hour-and-a-half of anybody's time.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","anirudhajith","20 October 2018","Up (2009): Dir: Pete Docter / Voices: Edward Asner, Jordan Nagai, Bob Petersen, Christopher Plummer, Pete Docter: Adventurous animation regarding living life to the fullest. Elderly Carl Fredricksen descends to the air bound for South American Paradise Falls via thousands of balloons lifting his house. He is accompanied by an eight year old kid out for adventure. While third act is ridiculous with dogs flying planes, director Pete Docter is backed with extraordinary visual images. He previously made another inventive Pixar animation called Monsters Inc.

He will now make the trip with Russell and become the father figure he never was. Jordan Nagai voices the enthusiastic Russell whose meaning is obvious. Bob Petersen voices Dug the dog with a voice collar and a better route in life in mind. Christopher Plummer voices the villain whose story is depressing considering his humiliation. His ability to render dogs in flight with speech collars is insane, and his defeat is at the mercy of his accusers. Pete Docter provides the noises of the rare bird in edition to directing this epic animation. The film teaches our potential regardless of our age. Score: 8 / 10","

"SPIRITED AWAY","kennizle","8 July 2021","A few years ago, I watched the film ""Gran Torino"" and was completely blown away by director Clint Eastwood's take on themes such as aging, friendship, and coming to terms with one's own life. However, those who are easily offended (by either harsh language or non-political correctness) would likely not be able to get past those hang-ups, while kids are ruled out altogether. Thankfully, Pixar's ""Up"" explores those same themes in a much more family-friendly fashion.Basically, the story centers on Carl Fredricksen, a senior citizen widower who's being cajoled out of his old relic of a house by construction (""progress"") on all sides of him. Instead of going out smoothly, though, Carl decides (being a retired balloon salesman) to fly his home (via a gaggle of helium balloons!) to Paradise Falls, the mystical place that him and his deceased wife Ellie always dreamed of, but never quite realized. However, there is one hitch in the plan...that being the completely helpless boy scout, Russell, who just happened to be on the wrong porch at the wrong time. As they make their way towards the falls, Carl and Russell encounter a slew of new characters and challenges, making it truly an adventure in every sense of the word.The first level that this film really works at is with the kiddies...the intended viewers. There are enough sight gags (involving the rotund Russell and crotchety Carl) and crazy characters (the talking dog ""Dug""...squirrel!) to keep their interest the whole runtime.However, on a much deeper level, this film will truly move even the most adult of viewers. An amazing sequence towards the beginning of the film depicts the marriage (both the ups and the downs) of Carl and Ellie, and really sets up Carl's character development as he is forced to venture out into the world again and bond with young Russell. With each passing moment (and new adventure), viewers get the feeling that Carl is taking another small step closer to making a clean break from the past and living for the here and now. The scene where he finally realizes that fact is enough to make your eyes begin to water.Thus, I consider ""Up"" to be the pinnacle (at least so far) of animated films for its ability to make you laugh, tantalizing your senses, and really draw you into the characters and their successes/struggles.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","cosmic_quest","6 October 2004","Co-written by directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson from a story created by them alongside Thomas McCarthy, Up begins with an absolutely moving sequence that, in just a few minutes, depicts the beautiful love story between Carl Fredricksen and Ellie, from childhood to old age. With an extremely elegant narrative economy, this introduction portrays, almost without any dialogue, the routine of a couple who, dreaming of a trip to South America and a house full of babies, is forced to adapt to reality as they the difficulties and disappointments of everyday life get in the way - and when this sequence comes to an end, not only has the film already won and moved the audience, but it has also established, in an incredibly efficient way, the motivations and personality of the interesting protagonist.Pixar's brilliance, by the way, can already be seen in the confident and intelligent way the narrative is conducted: aware that the intro would likely immerse the audience in a melancholy atmosphere, the filmmakers immediately break the mood with a small visual gag, when Carl , getting out of bed, cracks his spine while trying to stretch his body - and the contrast between this brief moment of humor and the sad scene that came immediately before already establishes Up as a film capable of oscillating with talent between pain and joy.And the drama of ""Up"" is so memorable because in addition to dealing with themes that involve relationships and dreams, the film stars characters generally reneged on the role of supporting actors in cinema - especially in adventure works. Here we have an elderly man and a chubby boy who have experiences that bring out feelings of abandonment, and who together will come together to help each other.With a technical refinement typical of Pixar productions, Up represents the studio's first foray into 3D technology - and it is not for nothing that the film already begins with a metalinguistic joke by displaying ""archive"" images that, through the retreat of the camera, become reveal as scenes projected on a cinema screen, establishing a link between that audience's plunge and our own on our respective big screens. That said, directors never use 3D as an end in itself, using the resource only as a complement to the action - and so instead of relying on objects that seem to jump towards the viewer, Docter and Peterson prefer to deposit their energies in the beautiful production design, as when conceiving an airship whose conventional exterior ends up surprising by housing an internal environment whose narrow corridors end up opening up to impossibly wide spaces. Likewise, the look of the characters is an attraction in itself, from Carl's square face, which contrasts with his impeccably round nose, to the villain Charles Muntz (Plummer's) physiognomy, clearly inspired by Kirk's unmistakable face. Douglas. (Also, notice how the protagonist's beard starts to emerge over time, in a careful detail that serves as a typical example of what separates Pixar from other computer animation companies.)Each character in Up is a class in character building. Carl and Russel are, respectively, the maximum characterization of the grumpy old man and the electric child. Even though these ""reductions"" are clichés, in the skillful hands of Pete Docter and Bob Peterson they become the springboard for two lives separated by many years of experience that gradually converge into a ballet of dialogues and small revelations that he is capable of. Soften the most rigid hearts. Before Scout Russell's arrival, Carl symbolized castration. Carl's old age, at the beginning of the film, is represented by a negative look, of disability and decadence. Carl is grumpy, stubborn, no longer has as much physical independence and does not want to interact socially. The cane and the heavy glasses he carries are symbols of old age and growing physical frailty. In addition to losing his physical and mental vigor, Carl also finds himself facing the loss of autonomy to choose where he wants to live, since he is practically expelled from his own house. The difficult interaction between you and the boy turns out to be permeated with a lot of learning. It is the daily life with Russell that makes Carl change his way of looking at the world and allows him to get the bonds of the past to be able to experience the adventures of the present.An explorer, the boy has the strength and energy that Carl no longer has. He is, in a way, the opposite of him, and reminds Carl of the feelings he had as a child. If Carl symbolizes decay, Russell is the potential, the growth. In an original way, it is Russell, at the height of his childhood, who helps Carl to find his place in the world. The film raises the question of the relationship between the exchange of knowledge between the generations that are at both ends of life. The interactions between Carl and Russell allow both characters to mature. This exchange of experiences promotes an enormous identification with the public and awakens the viewer's memory for the relationships between grandparents and grandchildren or the elderly and children in general.We also have other very pertinent criticisms. The expropriation of Carl's house, made unwillingly by the huge construction company, criticizes the contemporary, capitalist world, which prioritizes profits and sees in the widower's house only a space to increase the building he intends to build. When looking at the space and seeing only good ground for the work, the businessman denies the entire life story of Carl and Ellie, the way they rehabilitated the place and transformed the abandoned building into the family residence for decades. Residence is, therefore, a synthesis of life together.The house has a very strong symbology in the plot: the walls of the house witnessed the whole relationship, from the first day of the meeting - when the two played together with aviators - until the wife's last days. The imagination here is what ends up saving Carl, who uses the skills of the profession he had - he was a balloon salesman -, to literally make his own home take off. The rise of the house by the balloons represents a double solution: on the one hand Carl manages to protect the house as it is, protecting it from the interest of those who wanted to demolish it, and on the other hand, it manages, from within its comfort and space, also fulfill your dream. The house also represents Carl's love for Ellie, which did not end with his wife's death. Taking the house to South America also means, in a way, transporting Ellie to visit the longed-for place of her dreams and to honor her. The character's entry into the new phase of his life can be summed up by the moment when he manages to detach himself from the house, throwing away furniture and other memories that proved his resistance to the past. The new, here, is only possible after Carl learns to deal with the memory of what was left behind.And the drama of ""Up"" is so memorable because in addition to dealing with themes that involve relationships and dreams, the film stars' characters generally reneged on the role of supporting actors in cinema - especially in adventure works. Here we have an elderly man and a chubby boy who have experiences that bring out feelings of abandonment, and who together will come together to help each other. But not everything is perfect. What bothers me the most about ""Up"", is really the forced use of talking dogs, with them flying planes or sitting playing cards. But it also needs to be playful and it is a movie for children too, so I understand the purpose of such scenes and in the general balance it does not harm the drama or detract from the merits of the adventure.We also have other obvious problems, which is a pity - and the most disappointing of these concerns the unimaginative way in which the directors conceive the ""locations"" of the film: if we could initially assume that the Paradise dreamed by Carl and Ellie would prove to be a breathtaking place, so we are forced to realize that it is nothing more than a rocky and lifeless environment, wasting the chance that the feature film would have to dazzle us visually (and, in this respect, Up is one of Pixar's most bureaucratic jobs ). As if that wasn't enough, the relationship between Carl and Russell sounds schematic, made even more artificial given the confusing and clichéd way the script portrays the problems the boy faces with his father. And what can I say about the fate of the evil Muntz, who follows the same beaten path as so many other Disney villains?In fact, despite all the atmosphere of adventure and fiction present in the narrative, above all ""Up"" is a story about moving forward and building simple moments with important people. We often seek the grand, but the simple can be the essential that is often not valued, or invested. Up maintains Pixar's tradition of using its light stories to address surprisingly adult themes - and here perhaps the studio attacks one of the most difficult of them: the expectation of the human being in the face of their own dreams and loss. In trying to fulfill what he had promised Ellie, Carl is obviously seeking to recover the closeness he had with his wife, as if reaching the Paradise Falls (meaningful name, this) could bring some kind of comfort to his loss - and by stating that his loneliness and his pain remain unchanged, the protagonist has no choice but to continue living.Joining The Tomb of Fireflies and The Lion King on the list of animations capable of bringing adults to endless tears, Up - is another example of how Pixar digitally manages to build what most filmmakers contemporaries fail to create with real actors: stories and characters full of humanity and sweetness.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Lady_Targaryen","23 January 2006","Pixar has its first truly Disney project. It has all the hallmarks of the Pixal manual: it is obsessed with exploring the third dimension and it has an extremely refined engineering of story. It touches on thoroughly conventional family values in a slightly new way. And it has a strangely relevant short that precedes it.In this case, the three dimensional explorations that Pixar mastered are rendered in visual three D because Disney's corporate strategy requires it. Its a massive shame. That's because of the unintuitive fact that of all the exploration and innovation that Pixar has done has to do with novelties of the projection into a 2-d screen with a frame. The frame , usually constrained by the physics of the camera, has a broader physics in Pixar-land. But to get audiences to ""read"" the 3D, these extended physics are taken away and what we have is ordinary camera movement and framing.I may have a different experience when I see this in 2D, but I think not. All the cinematic fun, the adventure of the Pixar spirit, is missing here.The one thing that is outside the normal Pixar range is the color palette. It much richer here than usual. I think that may have also to do with Disney strategies for dealing with technology threats.The child here is Asian. That's also a market driven decision.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Craigelink","16 March 2020","The opening eleven minutes of Disney/Pixar's animated ""Up"" are pure poetry in motion. Chronicling a man's journey in life from boyhood to married adult to lonely widower, director Pete Docter gives us images which are extraordinarily heartfelt, so elegiac in tone they should take an audience's collective breath away. Big dreamers but relative homebodies, an elderly man and his wife live happily together alone in their house until her passing. Faced with eviction, the man gets an amazing idea overnight: attach thousands of helium-filled balloons to his rickety old house and sail it through the air to a revered point in South America. But, as with 2008's ""WALL·E"", there has to be dramatic conflict, a villain, a chase, and lots of outrageous comedy in order to attract the youthful target audience. In a perfect world, there would be a Pixar effort designed to steadfastly avoid this kind of commercial pandering to 10-year-olds. Once the house reaches the next continent, the man, now joined by a chatty juvenile, encounters a rare bird being hunted by a world-renown explorer--the 78-year-old's childhood hero--who fails to live up to his newsreel notoriety. The bird only wants to get back to her babies in their nest (how's that for conflict?), while the man and his kid-companion are held off by a pack of dogs who have voice-boxes in their collars. If this isn't bad enough, at one point the dogs even prove to be flying aces in fighter planes apparently held in storage since WWI (it's a lackluster homage to ""King Kong"", and a highly unnecessary one). The screenplay, written by Pete Docter and his assistant Bob Peterson from a treatment by Docter, Peterson and Thomas McCarthy, is so wonderfully cognizant of an elderly person's traits and attachments to their beloved belongings, to then witness the central character being chased by talking dogs is an insult. And yet, because the filmmakers are wise enough to keep returning to the tale's likable principles, ""Up"" is often vastly entertaining. The detail is marvelous, often beautiful, as is the subtle music score by Michael Giacchino. There are a handful of near-terrible moments in the film which keep it from being a true masterpiece, but Docter and his team are surprisingly honest when it comes to the sentiment. The friendships made and lost in ""Up"" are genuinely touching; and, though the slapstick is noisy and sometimes mean-spirited, the overall intent to somehow steer this vessel to a happily-ever-after ending is clearly evident and commendable. *** from ****","

This desire to experience things, see the world, live life to the fullest, and to do it with someone we love. All of this makes Carl a very relatable character and one that we can connect to almost instantly. Russell is a bit annoying at times and is there to appeal to the younger audience, but I grew to love him over the course of the film.The central idea is just pure Pixar genius and so full of magic and joy. I defy anyone not to crack a huge smile when that house starts to float. The plot is pretty standard Pixar, following the usual formula and with similar themes. It's very enjoyable, with a great pace to it and a terrific arc for our protagonist.As ever with a Pixar film, the voice performances could not be better. The animation is just breath taking. Some of the cloud animation could have been real, it is just so well done. The use of colour and sound in Up are also magnificent. It's just such a joy to look at.I do think this film is *slightly* over hyped, but maybe that's just because I was over 10 years late to the party watching it.Yet another Pixar gem!","

It's exactly what makes this animated Disney-Pixar adventure so entertaining, fulfilling and enjoyable to watch... Well, that's only IF you can properly make it through the first 10 minutes, although it'll make you ball your eyes out.The plot of the movie consists of a 78-year-old balloon salesman grieving over the death of his wife, but also going on to fulfil their lifelong dream: to fly their house to Paradise Falls. He is accompanied by a small boy named Russell and a cuddly dog named Dug who they encounter on the way. However, the fact that he's run a balloon vendor doesn't matter, and the film's just about his eventful and imaginative adventure to Paradise Falls.This movie will entertain and please everyone of all ages. The story is high on creativity, heavy on emotions, very sweet and uplifting, although it's tearjerking. The animation in this movie is just wonderful.

"SPIRITED AWAY","PIST-OFF","19 April 2021","The Walt Disney company released a series of somewhat ""groundbreaking"" animated films between 1937 and 1942 (""Snow White"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Bambi"", ""Dumbo"" etc). Thereafter it degenerated into a purveyor of a formulaic, predictable and increasingly saccharine features. Over the decades it became nothing less than a cultural force, plucking stories from countries all over the world and then skewing them until they fit the ""Disney formula"". Eventually Disney seemed to have stopped making animated films altogether. Each new release was simply an addition to some already existent, homogeneous, ""Disney Land"". This is a land of fairy tales, princes and princesses, wicked stepmothers, dead parents, song and dance numbers, bumbling sidekicks, lots of anthropomorphic charm, the ubiquitous fear of separation and punishment, and some pretty despicable values relating to gender, monarchs and class. Eventually it got to the point where it didn't matter what Disney's films were about. All that mattered were that they conformed to the rules of ""Disney Land"". The stories, the characters, the customer expectations, the brand awareness, all coalesced to form a kind of bland corporate mission statement.Gradually the company began to shamelessly use its commitment to ""wholesome"" entertainment to market an endless array of toys, gadgets and clothes to children. It all seemed quite innocuous, but beneath Disney's self-proclaimed role as an icon of culture, lies a powerful educational apparatus that provides ideologically loaded fantasies for children and adults alike. Fantasy, for Disney, has no basis in reality, no sense of real conflicts, struggles, motivations or social relations. Instead, ""fantasy"" becomes a marketing device, a form of hype rooted solely in the logic of self-interest and buying. In the early 1990s, Disney received praise for films like ""The Lion King"" and ""Beauty and The Beast"". The studio had re-found its form, some said. By the time Pixar Studios had established itself as a brand in the late 90s, however, Disney had once again lost its cool factor. Burnt by poor box-office returns, the company started making sequels to its more popular animations and began releasing them solely on DVD or TV. Much later they'd begin gobbling up outside mega-franchises (Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars etc).Pixar's evolution very much mirrors Disney's. After a string of somewhat revolutionary films, and Brad Bird's two fairly personal features, Pixar has begun a slow spiral into mediocrity, ""Cars"", ""WALL-E"" and ""Up"" representing the company on a downward slope.""Up"" is about an elderly man and young boy who travel to South America and have a series of adventures. It's a consistently funny film, but virtually every character here is contrived and understood entirely in one dimensional terms. An old man lost his wife, a wife lost her child, a young boy lost his father, a talking dog is bullied by other dogs, a giant bird is separated from its offspring...every single character seems cynically designed or calibrated to quickly illicit unearned sentiment. Pixar's last film, ""WALL-E"", was no different, death (there are about 4 death scenes in that film), loneliness and loss rolled out like Pavlovian commands. See, ""WALL-E"" is dead, why not shed a tear? See, the old man lost his wife, why not weep? Of course Pixar's films have always been sentimental, but they were sentimental in subtler or original ways. Think the smile which ends ""Monster's Inc"", the food critic's flashback at the end of ""Rattatoille"" or the brief shot of unhatched eggs in ""Finding Nemo"".Ignoring Pixar's emotional regression, its plots have also become increasingly generic. ""Up"" in particular feels like a cocktail of bits and pieces plucked from ""Ice Age 3"", ""The House of Small Cubes"", ""The Red Balloon"", ""Fitzcarraldo"", ""King Kong"" etc. For a film which features an airship called ""The Spirit of Adventure"", the film is strangely cowardly, content to trade in stock characters and lazy chase scenes. Elsewhere the film champions adventure with one hand whilst exalting the return to Norman Rockwellesque normalcy; everyday life, we learn, is adventure enough. And those who go off on mighty exhibitions go insane anyway. This is very much the Pixar formula. Pixar's characters live in a small world, discover a bigger world outside of their familiar surroundings, and then retreat quickly back to the box. Beyond all this, ""Up"" is Pixar's attempt to outright mimic Hayao Miyazaki (the director of ""Up"" directed the English voice dubs of Miyazaki's ""Howl's Moving Castle"", another film with old people in a moving house). Pixar/Disney chief John Lasseter has often cited Miyazaki as a key influence on Pixar, but Miyazaki's films have a subtlety and sense of auteurism that these latest Pixar offerings lack. Observe, for example, the gorgeous flying scenes in ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", ""Nausica"", ""Castle In the Sky"" and ""Porcco Rosso"". In comparison, the ""flying"" scenes in ""Up"" are strangely inert. While previous Pixar films have exploited space to great effect, ""Up"" is awash with flat compositions and ordinary camera work.Still, the film has some good moments, most of them occurring in ""Up's"" first half. Here we're treated to several clever visuals, jokes and powerful montages, some of which seem cribbed from Kunio Kato's ""The House of Small Cubes"" and Michael Apted's ""Up"", the latter a noteworthy documentary series which chronicles the lives of several human beings, from cradle to grave. It's all very sad.7.9/10 - Worth one viewing. See ""From Up on Poppy Hill"", ""The Girl who Leapt through Time"" and ""The King of Pigs"".","

Or off it.UP is a unique animated adventure that follows crusty retiree Carl (voiced by Ed Asner) on his adventures in trying to float his house with thousands of balloons to his dream locale.Another humbling display of Pixar's incredible grasp of story structure. How do Pixar do it? Look at their ratings record on IMDb - every major theatrical release (except CARS) scores 8/10 or above. From TOY STORY to THE INCREDIBLES to WALL-E, it is becoming boring referring to them ""batting another out of the park."" They know no other trajectory.The first section of the movie is a sad little vignette all on its own. We first meet Carl as a cute little boy, marveling at the exploits of adventurer Charles Muntz (voice of Christopher Plummer). Also a fan of Muntz, Carl's future wife, Ellie (Elie Docter), whom he Meets Cute in a dilapidated house, as she pretends to fly it to an enigmatic South American rainforest plateau called Paradise Falls. A whirlwind montage of Ellie's and Carl's lives as they marry, move into that house and try to keep ends met while still vowing to trek to Paradise Falls ""someday."" He's a balloon salesman at the zoo, while she works in the South American exhibit. Montage rushes through their married life, dark days of miscarriage, old age, and finally Ellie's death, throughout, a picture of their promised destination on the mantel seeming to recede further into childhood fantasy. It stirs simultaneous nostalgia, bereavement and regret.And it's just a cartoon! As city developers tear down everything around Carl's little house, he resolves to make his fantasy a reality. He attaches thousands of air balloons to his house, rends it from its moorings and takes to the skies, with ingenious steering and sailing mechanisms that were once merely play-acting ropes for young Ellie.Along for the ride is a plump little Asian-American boy scout, Russell (Jordan Nagai), who was on Carl's porch when he lifted off. It is refreshing that Pixar would create this mixed-ethnicity character, as it has always been the provenance of spoiled blond white kids (which Carl was in the opening scenes) to go on adventures such as these.En route to the Falls, Carl and Russell encounter a big exotic bird which Russell names Kevin (and continues to call it that even after it is discovered the bird is a mother), a dog named Dug with a special collar that enables him to speak (voice of co-writer-director Bob Peterson) and Muntz himself as a neurotic recluse with his pack of trained collar-speaking hounds.Using the word ingenious to describe Pixar is like using skank to describe Britney Spears - it's intrinsic; built into every detail of this production, from the logistics of Carl's balloon-powered house to Muntz's airship, to the house-airship chase through canyons, and the endearing little animation details.Characterizations are, once again, as good as you will find in any drama. Though the movie obviously has a strong kiddie demographic, Russell's pathological need to earn his badges to impress his absent father is far from the usual syrupy guff. And watch how artfully Dug's lovable character is carved out in a few seconds of screen time, through his actions, voice and content of his disjointed dialog--squirrel! This is why Pixar shames Disney when it comes to writing ""real"" characters - Disney's are STILL written as naively as Amy Adams plays Giselle in ENCHANTED (2007).Pixar writing vets Pete Docter (TOY STORY, MONSTERS, INC) and Bob Peterson (FINDING NEMO) direct, with Thomas McCarthy sharing co-writing credits with them. Creating an action-adventure without overpowering the people at the heart of it.UP was recommended to me by a screenwriter as an example of the perfect execution of the screenplay form. It is. A whip-cracking put-us-in-our-place illustration of just how a story should be told, with humor, action, poignancy, and every little detail paid off--squirrel!","

"SPIRITED AWAY","subscriptions","7 September 2006","""Up"" may be more emotionally charged than previous Pixar efforts, though almost exclusively in its first act, and is nevertheless a step down in storytelling for the company that last year brought us ""Wall-E"" and before that ""Ratatouille."" ""Up"" suffers in comparison to those films, and happily resigns itself from 'good Pixar' to regular good.The story follows reluctant protagonist Carl Fredrickson, a 78-year old balloon salesman, who along with his now-departed wife, always dreamt of flying to adventure in Paradise Falls, South America. During a moving, poignant montage of his life, it becomes clear that the opportunity for adventure is passing the couple by. So when the widower Carl is sued and his home threatened, he takes the opportunity to take off, the house held afloat by thousands upon thousands of colorful balloons for the adventure he never had. All goes according to plan until he discovers Russell, an overeager ""wilderness explorer,"" has stowed away beneath his porch.The second act is the film's weakest, and the adventure advertised boils down to a few paltry miles. After a brief storm sequence, the unlikely pair find themselves on the other side of the canyon, but nevertheless ""three days"" from Paradise Falls. With the floating home strapped to their backs, Carl and Russell begin their trek, only to be sidetracked by the obligatory supporting characters, amusing though they may be: ""Kevin"" a fictional female dodo-like bird with hilarious favoritism, and ""Doug"" a golden retriever with a dog-to-English translation collar.Where the film finds itself in trouble is in keeping the established themes at the forefront of the story when the arbitrary sequence of events in the second act unfold. The villain, Carl's childhood idol (which makes this guy how old?), a disgraced adventurer by the name of Charles Muntz, is the perfect match as a man who's been corrupted by his dreams, but he's never developed to a satisfying level and receives relatively little screen time.Muntz's minions are a wellspring of only occasionally successful gags, an armada of translation-collared dogs tasked with hunting down Carl, Russell, and most importantly, Kevin. Their presence in the film feels somewhat random, and not quite funny enough to justify. It's becoming an ironically dirty word in reference to Pixar's work, but it all feels a little too cartoony.The visuals are as strong as the best Pixar has offered, though shot composition gives everything a sort of flat feel to it (a problem perhaps 3-D was meant to rectify), with characters seldom moving on more than one plane, leaving the environments feeling oddly like stage backdrops.""Up"" is sadly Pixar's last original film until 2013, but with its glaring screenplay problems, it may be for the best that the studio recharge its creative cannons. After ten feature films, nine completely original, it's hard to leverage complaints against ""Up"" greater than that it simply isn't their best work. It may not be the revelation that ""Ratatouille"" or ""Wall-E"" were, but middle of the road Pixar is still worth the price of admission.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Christopher_Reid","10 June 2007","For a few perilous moments in the middle of ""Up,"" I began to suspect that the folks at Pixar just might be about to register their first major stumble in the studio's hitherto flawless reign as ""king"" of the computer-animated film (a reign which began with ""Toy Story"" all the way back in 1995). But, like the airborne house that floats at the center of the story, the movie eventually righted itself and sailed off smoothly into the wild blue yonder.This generally wistful and enchanting film tells the tale of Carl Fredricksen, a grumpy old man whose beloved wife, Ellie, has recently died, taking their dream - of traveling to South America, to a place called Paradise Falls, and setting up home there - to the grave with her. When Carl is threatened with eviction, he hatches a fantastical scheme of attaching hundreds of helium-filled balloons to the house and flying to South America on sheer wind power alone. This he does, accompanied by an adorable little tyke named Russell, who just happens to be caught under the porch at the moment of liftoff.So far, so good, as ""Up"" captivates us completely with its imagination, its lyricism and its charm, along with its visual homage to such earlier classics as ""The Red Balloon,"" ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Around the World in 80 Days."" There's also a stunning montage sequence which chronicles - without narration or dialogue - the complete married life of the Fredricksens, starting with their wedding and ending in Ellie's eventual death.The trouble for ""Up"" begins to rear its ugly head only after Carl and Russell have arrived at their intended destination. Here they are confronted by a number of strange and exotic creatures, including a hitherto unclassified species of bird and a bunch of dogs who've been given the ability to speak by some sort of shadowy mad scientist who's clearly up to no good in this remote corner of the world. At times, we begin to suspect that once the writers, Bob Petersen and Pete Docter, came up with the idea of launching an old Victorian house into the stratosphere, they never really figured out what to do with it once they got it up there. But the messy mixture of science fiction and jungle melodrama they've come up with is unworthy of all the quality work that has come before it.Yet, what eventually saves ""Up"" from crashing and burning in its second half is the wonderful voice work by Ed Asner, Christopher Plummer and Jordan Nagai, the soaring and sweetly romantic score by Michael Giacchino, and the theme that sometimes our yearning for adventure can make us so myopic that we fail to perceive the ""adventure"" that's happening right in front of our eyes on a day-by-wonderful-day basis (more shades of ""The Wizard of Oz""). These alone are enough to compensate for the occasional narrative misfires, a made-to-order villain, and an overabundance of drooling, snarling pooches that feel strangely out-of-place in a tender and lyrical fable such as this one.The animation and backgrounds aren't quite as rich and compelling as they were in Pixar's previous two ventures, ""Ratatoille"" and ""Wall-E,"" but the less spectacular look actually makes ""Up"" a more contemplative, relaxing work to sit through.","

It's a great kids film and it even holds a lot of comedy for adults.I had a lot of fun and enjoyed a lot of the great comedy throughout this movie, even though it's filled with a lot of sadness. It has a cliché montage in the first ten minutes to show a lot of time passing and allow for the main character of Carl to be old.Russel is quite a show-stealing character with his comedic relief and the dog Dug who is a hyper-active upbeat talking dog helps give some comedy too. It's really unlimited in terms of comedy.It's got a tad bit of romance, and it's filled with tragedy for more than one character. It's a fun movie full of heart. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I'm sad I didn't take a look at it in 2009 when it came out. But I'm glad I finally saw it. It's one of the best Pixar has ever had to offer.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Wccsua_y","1 April 2020","Pixar has become the most dependable studio out there for producing reliable films that don't simply continue to raise the bar in animation but set a level of excellence in storytelling that puts most live-action movies to shame. 'Up' represents another change in style, as significant as Wall-E's shift to photorealism, intricate camera effects and darker themes. It effectively blends moments of tragedy with almost slapstick humor, while showing that their understanding of story structure and pacing gets more refined with every release.Up is about a 70-something ex-balloon salesman who fulfills a lifelong dream of adventure by tying thousands of balloons to his house and flying away to South America. This trip, inspired by his adventure- loving wife who dies before their dream is realized, is forced when property developers attempt a compulsory purchase on his house and try to move him to a retirement home (issues of death and eminent domain in a cartoon?). The problem is that he has an enthusiastic - and fatherless - 8-year old Wildness Explorer stowed away on the property when it takes off. Their adventure focuses on the characters they meet along the way, while our hero Carl is still trying to drag his house to the dream destination at the top of a waterfall.The opening shows the life of Carl, growing from an young boy, meeting his adventuring-loving girlfriend, their marriage and her death just before their adventure starts - it's an incredibly emotional 5-minute intro that's light on dialog and heavy on visuals, and didn't leave a dry eye in the theater. This sequence in particular was reminiscent of the dialog-free sections of Wall-E which deliver their plot punches without exposition or the need for endless sequences that would take twice as long in live action. But this approach doesn't leave the younger audience behind either, and for such a dark start, all I could see in the audience were kids and adults alike glued to the screen.I won't give away any more plot details since the film doesn't open for another three weeks, but every scene and character trait is meticulously plotted so that nothing seems too ridiculous or contrived, even for such a fantastic journey. The graphic stylization is also fresh, in the same way that The Incredibles had a very distinct and authentic look. All of this serves to heighten the humor and there are some extremely funny scenes, helped by the way the characters are quickly and believably established (even the talking dogs, but you'll see what I mean).This is the second time I've been to Pixar to see a pre-release of a movie and I felt a little scared before seeing this one, wondering if their run of first-class work may have hit a plateau. On the surface, I didn't really think a story about a senior in a flying house could live up to Wall-E, yet although the films are as different as they can be, Up is as gripping and entertaining as any Pixar film. Their ability to blends styles and take the audience from laughter to tears in minutes showcases their deep understanding of story, and it's a shame that more films aren't crafted the same way.Up opens on May 29, and I highly recommend it to everyone. The next two films out of Pixar will be Toy Story 3 (2010) and Cars 2 (2011). By the way, look at for a very funny short film before Up called Partly Cloudly.","

However, just as a violent storm carries the airborne building to South America, Carl discovers that he's got an unexpected stowaway.Unfortunately, not everyone at the film company was happy about Peter Docter's idea.

"SPIRITED AWAY","iamanoob0","20 June 2021","It's gotten to the point that most people assume that whatever Pixar does, it's going to hit a home run. But in the case of their latest 3-D animated story, ""Up"", I'm sad to report that this new Pixar concoction does not live up to the all the hype. For those who are watching a Pixar animated film for the first time, of course 'Up' will seem quite impressive. After all, no other studio comes close to Pixar when it comes to the technical aspects of animation. But ultimately, whether a film is animated or not, it's the story and the characters that make a film great.It was a bold move to choose an octogenarian as the film's protagonist—on the surface the crotchety curmudgeon, Carl Fredrickson, the elderly Spencer Tracy look-a-like, is the type of character we haven't seen before especially in an animated film. And 'Up' starts off with two very neat scenes: 1) a take-off on the old Movietone newsreels a la Citizen Kane and 2) a lovely montage sequence which chronicles the graceful aging of Carl and Ellie, the girl he's known since childhood, who becomes his wife.The montage sequence is notably silent and doesn't allow for much character development as to what makes Carl tick. It seems he was always introverted but seemingly happy until Ellie's death. It's perhaps suggested that loneliness has turned Carl into a curmudgeon but with all those happy memories of Ellie, I wonder why he turned into such a sour puss. And that essentially is the problem for most of the film: Carl is simply not very likable. He spends most of his time not acting very nice to Russell, the Explorer Scout stowaway, until the film's climax. But it's quite predictable when Carl finally learns the all-important life lesson that it's much better to be empathetic than uncaring.'Up' is similar to Pixar's prior effort, ""Wall-e', in that it takes too long to introduce the film's antagonist. In Wall-e, we spend a little too much time observing Wall-e as earth's last operable trash compactor. But even those activities prove to be far more interesting than the flying house in 'Up'. After about five minutes, the house with the balloons becomes tiresome; it's not a very clever idea to begin with and all the smashups as it makes it way to South America, prove to be more repetitious than Wall-e's penchant for turning mounds of junk into perfect cubes.When we finally meet up with the long lost ""Man of Adventure', Charles Muntz, and we saw that Muntz was already probably 30 years old in the newsreel at the beginning of the film, then we must conclude Muntz would be at least 110 years old when he meets up with Carl. But he doesn't look a day older than 90! Muntz at least has a little more personality than Carl but he's much too mean a character for such a light-hearted story. For all parents who plan to take their young children to see 'Up', be forewarned: Muntz and his talking dogs are vicious and wholly inappropriate for your young children who will probably leave the movie theater quite scared and some even crying! The giant dodo-like bird, Kevin, is much more appropriate for the kids but when Muntz's pit bulls start attacking him in old-fashioned bi-planes (straight out of King Kong), the charm flies out the door.The film's denouement wouldn't have been so bad had the adventure in South America been a little more engaging. There were just too many scenes of Carl and Russell tethered to the house, huffing and puffing as they try to reach the illusory waterfalls along with the talking dogs. The rest of it was perfectly acceptable: Carl becomes the good guy, realizes that the reaching his goal was an illusion and bonds with Russell back home. The best part of the film are the closing credits which give us a sneak peak into Carl and Russell's life after their return to the 'ordinary world'.In the end, 'Up' is a tale of political correctness. Two outsiders, the elderly Carl and the obesity challenged Wilderness Explorer Russell, are able to not only defeat pure evil but overcome both the forces of nature and their own limitations. For Carl it's his self-pity and for Russell it's his lack of self-confidence. Ultimately 'Up' falls 'down' since it's all rather predictable stuff. Pixar has become complacent, simply resting on its laurels. There is only one direction Pixar can go from now onand that is up!","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Elise_Graham","22 September 2003","Once again, I shouldn't have trusted that preview, or it might have been that the short before ""Up"" was so wonderful, or was it that the mostly silent introduction to our main character was nothing short of glorious... somewhere, though, this film lost its ability to touch in the way other Pixar and animated features have done in the past.""Up"" is supposedly about achieving our dreams, discovering who we really are, learning to adapt to the changes life brings to us, and so many other themes that it is a wonder we even recognize them, as the film changes from an intimate portrayal of two lonely people to a rather hectic adventure that barely rises above average.The animation is, of course, superb, and the vocal work by all the people involved is first-rate. Problems arise when we notice than other than the amazing prologue, most of the good stuff has already been show in the preview. The other sections don't quite muster enough emotional power to make us care. For instance, the vistas aren't impressive, the set action pieces near the end don't carry much wallop, and it's hard to have a movie that lacks. The film just feels like some non-threatening film that is paying tribute to movies that had originality and the right tone. I couldn't help wondering what people like Spielberg and Zemeckis could have done with this movie, and the echoes of ""Wall-e"" kept haunting me, as I remembered the lyricism of that movie that made us remember what it is like to be human in the middle of all these choking technology. ""Up"" doesn't quite take you up for the ride, or make you feel ""up"". There is no cathartic moment, no real payoff, and the best moments are the sentimental moments when pictures of their loving relationship is on the screen.Marketing can do wonders, and this will be a huge moneymaker. Hopefully it will only receive the credit it really deserves, and audiences will be wiser so next, we enjoy something beyond a small, sweet film that couldn't quite give us what we expected.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","IkuharaKunihiko","7 July 2006","The negative reviews for this are horrible. The story was not too sad. It was like life is for old people. Their spouse dies, and they live by themselves. That, however, did not happen to Carl Fredrickson. He meets a lively adventurous little boy, and has a fantastic, exciting, and yes perilous adventure in the place of his childhood dreams. This adventure is in the loving memory of his wife, and although he starts out thinking the little boy is an annoyance, they become almost family by the end of the story. This is not a sad story. It is about a lonely old man, and a boy from a broken family making an unlikely and meaningful friendship. If anyone, says this story is too sad, I point to the ending. Was it sad? No. People compare this to the masterpiece of Wall-E which I think was equally if not more sad. Earth is an inhospitable wasteland, mankind turns into lazy useless blobs. Only at the end of that story is it happy and hopeful, which is the same for UP. UP is an UPlifting masterpiece about hope, friendship, adventure, and love.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","grantss","12 April 2015","The five brains of Docter, Stanton, Lasseter, Peterson & McCarthy, put out yet another heartfelt and moving, family-fun adventure film! They incorporated a lot of emotional notes, with some great laughs! The first act is the best first act Pixar has ever put out! It gets the audience connected and invested so fast, by using detailed flashbacks to set up a sentimental montage; making us truly care for our main protagonist, Carl Fredrickson.Carl Fredrickson, voiced by Ed Asner, had the most pronounced character arch, being a character you truly cared about the whole time, despite his negative attitude half of the time. He brings a lot of mature wit to the film, dishing out the harsh truth at times. Russell, voiced by Jordan Nasgai is a loud, yet optimistic & charming character, that had great merit. He may have gotten to be a tad annoying as the film proceeds, but he is a fantastic addition to Carl. Charles F. Muntz, voiced by Christopher Plummer, is our main antagonist. He really wasn't anything special, or unpredictable; he just served his purpose at a surface level. Dug, voiced by Bob Peterson was nothing but a fury enjoyment at first, but ended up having great character development, and a respectable place in the film. Kevin is just one of those animals, Pixar continues to throw into films, that they try to make important. Kevin was better than most animal additions, but I didn't truly care for his reason, or his character at all.The cinematography and animation created this very vibrant and colorful film. The animations were beautifully detailed, along side the breathtaking backdrops and scenery.Although Up has a lot of entertaining moments, it doesn't come without a few bumps in the road. Even though the opening act is one of the best we've seen from Pixar, it's really hard to keep that pace up for the whole run time. Up does it's best to do just that, but does slack in some areas. With Pixar, they create these mental obstacles that you need to be able to overlook, and in Up's case, it has a few easy nitpicks. I had no problems overlooking some obstacles, but they incorporated a lot of stretched out abilities, with the leeway they were already granted. Another strange thing they did was create a few counteracting tones, trying to be poignant at some points, but silly throughout most of the film.Overall, Up is one of Pixar's finest, and belongs in the top ten!","

It does actually give the impression that some thought has gone into it not to say daring in the storyline of a widower realizing - in the nick of time to borrow Noel Coward's phrase - that life is for living and lighting out in a house propelled by helium-filled balloons for South America. Not least effective is a lovely montage sequence that takes our hero from childhood through dating, marriage and loss of his much-loved wife. To put this at the top of the show and risk alienating the kids was brave indeed. The 'action' may take some swallowing - we are, after all, talking geriatric here - but is easily overlooked.

Sorry - I know lots of people (including critics) love this film, but I'm just calling it as I saw it. There were no earth-shattering scenes that I'm replaying in my mind, quotable quotes that I will quote one day, nor mind-blowing visuals that I will tantalizingly dwell on. For me, it was just a good movie, nothing more.A lot of this movie is like Wall-E. There's a lot of focus on a few main characters and their quirky behaviors and mannerisms. If you like that sort thing, great! The action-oriented plot that comes later in the movie was good, but again, not quite great.A real disappointment was the mysterious, goofy bird that was being sought after in the jungle. A mysterious exotic 'creature' or something would have been far engaging. Instead, we get an ungainly, multi-colored bird that's kind of a cross between an ostrich and the cocoa-puffs cereal bird.3D: This movie was pretty tame in its use of 3D. It's there, but after 10 minutes, I'll it kind of fades to the background. Just a day later, I remember the film only as a 2 dimensional movie, not a 3D one.Soooo ... what do I recommend? I recommend seeing it! Even though I give it a 6/10, I know that my view is in the minority of viewers and that the likelihood that the average movie-goer will like it is high.What I would recommend is, if you care to, give it a fair critical shake after you see it.

One can certainly discuss how well the Disney studio has taken care of this legacy, but the company that kept the innovation going for it has obviously been Pixar. Step by step, movie by movie, the people at Pixar have kept outdoing themselves. To me, Wall-E was them crossing the final frontier, breaking their own roof and kept going towards the stars. That wasn't just a family adventure and it wasn't a kids movie. It was about two machines and the entire human race - a movie for audiences, don't you think?Up is a companion piece on the same level. It's not about the entire human race, but it's about the entire life of a human being - this is a movie that tries to learn very young people a little something about very old people. In the beginning of the movie we meet Carl, a little toddler with stars in his eyes, dreaming about going out into the world for adventure. Coming home from a Newsreel concerning his biggest adventurer hero, he passes a house where adventurous things seem to be in full motion. Thus, he meets Ellie, a happy gal with equally grand dreams as himself. Now, in any other animated movie this would be our two main characters, kids on the screen for kids in the theater to relate to. But what follows is a montage, spawning decades, and upon the end of this montage we meet our main protagonist - it's Carl alright, but now he's Mr. Fredricksen, a cranky old man. The movie has just outrun the eight year olds by 70 years or so! Hey little Charlie, this is your life Mr. Fredricksen. It's dangerously brilliant.Our cranky old hero has a warm and colorful life behind him, but he never got to go out on any of those adventures. While there's still time, and while there's certainly nothing better to do, Carl figure it's time for some adventure so he flies away in his house toward South America, the land of his dreams. His only baggage is Russell, the real kid for the kids in the audience to ""relate"" to. Carl finds him obnoxious and even though Russell is your average modern eight year old, I guess the real modern eight year olds in the movie house should understand why by now. Back in the days, all Carl and Ellie knew about South America was that it was ""America, only south"". Russell takes GPS for granted and says ""You're going to South America? You know, most people take a plane, but you're smart because you'll have all your TV and clocks and stuff."" Russell doesn't seem to have any pure, authentic dreams of adventure in him, and he's certainly not that imaginative, but he does like chocolate.What follows is an adventure as old fashioned as it is fun and original. There's something very classical about the whole fair; an amazing flying machine that has to be repaired somehow, strange dangers in the jungle and giant zeppelins with the insides of luxurious steamboats. In a sense, this is also an adventure movie about adventure movies - it's part of the adventure to explore jungles, discover strange animals and exciting secrets. Carl knew this when he was eight but now, almost eighty, it's all just a nuisance. He is totally uninterested in whatever they discover. ""Can we keep it?"" Russell says. ""No"" Carl keeps replying and continues to limp along. ""But it's a talking dog!!"" Russell finally exclaims.Up also has fairy tale touch to it that is woven into the visual dynamic. It feels as if it's taken inspiration both from the films of Miyazaki, and from that elegant French style of animation that borders to realism. The adventure is strange enough to make you fall back into escapism, but at the same time it's all very close to heart. Carl Fredricksen is as believable as Walter Matthau or Jack Lemmon were in Grumpy Old Men. Up seems to salute these kind of cranky old men too, it seems to give an homage to this soon extinct generation of analog, post- war dream weaving. It also seems to be wanting to tell the kids of today that you should really try and be nice to cranky old men, because being one is not the easiest thing in the world. Another thing the movie seems to be telling us is that no matter how lonely and bittersweet life can be when you're at the end of your days, we are all children at heart.","

More than most seemed to feature some sarcastic little animal,voiced by an irritating overpaid recognisable actor picking up and easy paycheck. So, with trepidation i inserted Up in to my DVD machine and after 10minutes i realised i was watching something as imaginative as it was visually impressive. I never gave a second thought to who was voicing who.To my delight, i just let myself be carried away with the film and at the end i found myself having choked back the tears at least 5 times. Wow. I never thought a digimation could do that to me but it did. My hardened heart has been thawed by the sheer joy and creation on display in Pixars Up. A truly remarkable film done with love and passion that deserves all the plaudits and all the stars in all the magazines and review shows around the world. Perfection.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Dark Raven","21 September 2003","A sure instant classic from Pixar. From the minds of Pete Docter and Bob Peterson comes a timely and endearing story of Carl Fredrickson (voiced by Ed Asner), a grumpy widower, who is a hold out in the middle of major construction. He is not about to sell the home he shared with his devoted wife for decades. Carl and Ellie met as children both with dreams of following their adventurer idol Charles Muntz(Christopher Plummer)to a land of the lost, Paradise Falls in South America.After being forced to go to an old folks home, 78 yr old Carl attaches thousands of balloons to the roof and heads his home due south to find Paradise Falls in South America. The trip is barely under way when the old geezer discovers he has a stowaway...8 year old Russell(Jordan Nagai), a chubby wilderness explorer trying to earn his final patch. Carl is as grouchy as Russell is full of joy and excitement.This animated feature is emotional, funny and a pure joy to watch and is meant for the whole family. I don't even recall any juvenile potty humor that is usually obligatory for such flicks. Loneliness is bittersweet and the adventure itself is uplifting and touching. Definitely a feel good movie.Other voices you may or may not recognize: John Ratzenberger, David Kaye, Elie Docter and writer/director Peterson voices Dug, the dog.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","ccthemovieman-1","25 October 2006","As they did in ""Wall-E,"" the Pixar team creates an opening twenty minutes or so of movie in ""Up"" that in itself is a small masterpiece of streamlined narrative film-making, and if it doesn't leave you reduced to a puddle of dribbly tears by the time it's over, you have a heart of stone. However, also as in ""Wall-E"" but even more so here, the first part of the movie is so skillfully crafted that it leaves the rest of it somewhat lacking.I feel like the Pixar filmmakers are trying too hard to satisfy two different audiences with the same movie. ""Up"" is about very adult issues -- dealing with the loss of a life partner, the obsolescence of old age -- crammed around a not-all-that-interesting adventure comedy story designed to delight the kiddies. ""Wall-E"" suffered from the same syndrome slightly; but the theme of environmental awareness in that film was universal enough, and integrated wholly enough into the action sequences, that the schizophrenia of it all was easy to overlook. In ""Up,"" I would have preferred to just continue the story that's set up in the opening moments without the kid movie tangent, and that's what ultimately made ""Up"" a much less memorable viewing experience for me than other recent Pixar films.I wonder how long it will be before Pixar forms a unit that makes animated films strictly for adults, as they seem to want to.Grade: A-","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Lupercali","19 June 2004","After suffering the studio mandated crushing heartbreak Carl decides to embark on the adventure of a lifetime.This features great visual storytelling, which is of course necessary when you have a protagonist who feels a lot but is too closed off to say most of it a lot of the time. Solid comedy, especially physical, without feeling the need to humiliate senior citizens despite centering one. Same thing for overenthusiastic chatty Cub Scouts.It also delivers on excitement and tension, and is well-paced with not a single truly slow moment; it's not even tedious when watching characters be bored. I greatly appreciate the love of nature and animals, and criticism of aggressive city construction practices.I recommend this to everyone. 8/10.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","george.schmidt","7 October 2002","The sneak peeks and trailers to this movie did not particularly inspire me to go to this movie. It looked like it was a rambling movie that didn't really speak to the comic or action side to the viewer. A guy puts enough balloons together to lift a house off it's foundation: So WHAT??? He inadvertently picks up a scout as he flies away: Again... so WHAT?? Getting the point of a movie is a big reason to motivate people to go SEE a movie I would think. But this was a Pixar film, and I NEVER miss a Pixar film. So, in a moment of spontaneous motivation (and seeing that 2 out of three spawn were currently in house that morning), I popped some corn, my wife filled some water bottles, and we all piled into the Tan Mini-van and went down to the Metropolitan theater (where I felt confident I would not be met with a sour presentation of this film) to purchase tickets and view this movie.The last time I went to see an ""3D"" film was an iMax theater with sharks and fish. It was pretty cool, so I was happy to kid about how much the glasses added to the family appeal. We sat down and waded through the kiddie previews and trailers then came an announcement to put our 3D glasses on. The new Toy Story and Ice Age (both up to their 3rd sequel) previews were run. Sorry, when you get to a third sequel that wasn't originally written as a trilogy I can't get excited. The Disney lead-on filled the screen and away we went.Within the first 10 minutes I was angrily batting moisture from my cheeks. I was shocked. Pixar emptied the climax of the plot first off, but what an opening sequence of events! Without giving too much away, the plot revolves around a core of love and a promise. Remember those ""Cross your heart"" promises? Well, there you have it. The rest is a strange adventure with some odd sub-plots that seem thrown in to keep the kiddies focused. Both colorful and deep, the only real question one keeps throughout the movie is whether the promise will be fulfilled or not.My wife and I watched through the ending credits (hoping for a surprise tag somewhere. Sadly, no) and saw Brad Birds name come up in the conceptualization of this film, and granted some of his influence if felt. The primary animators are quite diversified and well established, some even old enough to be your father or grandfather. As I IMDb'd some of the talent, I was impressed... and as for Ed Asner playing the primary role: I thought he had died years ago!!! But he's alive, and a great talent for the part. Pete Docter who has been in the Pixar pen since the first Toy Story does an admirable job of making this one and a half hour film both entertaining and thoughtful. There are chases, there are technological malfunctions, there are obsessions, there are fanatics and there are devouts and totally absurd sequences. This movie is no less a study of society than ornithology is a study of birds. Its amazing.And all through it you get to see how generations meet and interact on a very honest level. I am not young, but I am not old. Each generation will find something totally involving in this film. From an artists point of view the artwork and color are spot on; from a comedy point of view it is not overwhelming; from the heart... well, it's profound.The audience clapped after it was over. During the viewing, there was a nominal level of noise from the ""too young to even enjoy Dr Suess"" generation but it wasn't distracting. This film is for kids; Well, not just kids... for kids, adolescents, early adulthood, young parents, old parents, grandparents... its for everyone. Highly recommended. Well done, Pixar, well done.","

The music, dialogue, characters, comedy, and story have ingrained themselves into my brain forever as something to behold. This film succeeds every time to hit the right emotional buttons for me. This I believe is because of how greatly developed each element is.
A criticism I see thrown around is that the first 10 minutes are great, while the rest isn't. I strongly disagree, because this film isn't only about the first 10 minutes. It is about an old man getting the adventure of his lifetime, hoping to do it for his deceased wife, but eventually letting himself move on from it. The very end of the film when Carl lets his house float away saying ""it's just an old house"" perfectly encompasses this theme.
I can totally understand people not liking this movie as much as me, or preferring a different pixar film over this one (I love just about every pixar film) but subjectively, this film has had the greatest impact on my life, and I appreciate it to the moon and back.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","claudio_carvalho","17 September 2012","'Up', the latest delightful animated film from Pixar, combines whimsicality, beautiful graphics and a lot of laughs. It follows in the spirit of previous Pixar movies, most obviously its immediate predecessor 'WALL-E', but has something of its own flavour too - although the medium is different, there are elements of this film that would not have been out of place in Nick Park's 'Wallace and Grommit' films. What really has impressed many people about Pixar's films, and which certainly impressed me about this one, is not just that they feature groundbreaking animation, but they are put together with a real auteur's eye: look for the quality of the scene composition, or the way that the final images of one scene fit visually and thematically with the starting images of the next, and it's clear that this is a film made by people who know how to make movies (although for once, John Lasseter himself is not directing, and the job is done instead by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson). And ask yourself, have many mainstream Hollywood blockbusters feature two (sympathetic) characters as unglamourous as a childless widower and a fat kid? This is a gentle movie, for sure; but also a genuinely funny one, and oddly, in spite of its fantastical story, a certain grounding in truth actually lacking in most live action Hollywood films.","

Along the journey he teams up with a scout named Russell,a dog named Dug and a peacock and together they go off on an adventure. The animation in this film is very well done and the first 10 minutes of this film is very sentimental where we see Carl(Ed Asher from Elf)who meets his future wife who was a real tomboy and we as the audience get to see them growing up to actually falling in love to actually growing old together. That was just genius the way the filmmakers did this. Also the story is very good too and if you haven't seen this movie I strongly recommend it. When I first seen this film first I actually despise it because it felt rather boring and just too overrated for my likings. But when I finally seen it again another few times I actually changed my mind on it and ended up liking the film.","

So, in order to avoid getting into a nursing home, he makes his house fly with the help of balloons, in order to get it to the place he always dreamed of living. I can't really find anything that could possibly have bothered me with Up, except some corny details and unreasonably confusing plot holes. But those things can easily be overlooked when the rest of the movie is worth watching. It is emotional, issuing with many touching and difficult subjects, such as loosing a loved one, parents divorce and others. And, in my opinion, the movie handles them beautifully, so that even a child could understand them and still have fun with the movie. And there for I give Up an 8 out of ten.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","MickeyTheConstant","20 March 2019","5 July 2009. ""Up"" attempts the difficult fusion of both children and adult elements in the same movie and usually succeeds marvelously at both. This sharp, 3-D animated movie handles both roarously funny scenes along with dramatic emotional scenes dealing with love, growing old, and the issue of what's important in life. However, as a serious movie, it attempts to incorporate childlike fantasy elements and sometimes the rigors of logical and reasonable cause and effect go out the window which would be no problem in a traditional animated movie directed towards young people. But ""Up"" in attempting to have it both, both serious grown-up issues and thoughtful scenes, it brings with it an expectation of a tighter reign on more realistic scenes regarding chases and escapes while thrilling go beyond plausibility, breaking the suspension of animated realism, which when 3-D is used actually increases the need for virtual practical sequences. Overall however, this movie is captivated with fabulous colors, the action is riveting, the plot outline decently strong and in some instances even more intimate than Coraline (2009). 8/10.","

Carl Fredricksen(Ed Asner) was a lonely little boy who worships an explorer named Charles Muntz, a man who was disgraced for faking the discovery of a big bird in Venezuela. He meets Ellie, a neighbor who shares his passion for nature. When they grow up they marry, but are unable to have children. He sells balloons and she works at a zoo. They have always intended to travel to South America to verify Muntz's claims to clear his name. The best laid plans of mice and men prevent it and Elle dies, leaving Carl alone. His house is surrounded by a new development, but he refuses to leave. He injures a construction worker in a dispute, and receives an eviction notice. He comes up with the idea to attach thousands of helium balloons to lift the house into the air and fly it to Venezuela and fulfill his dream of finding Muntz's bird. He takes off with a stowaway, Russell, who is trying to earn a merit badge by helping the elderly. They meet a non flying bird and a talking dog along the way. They make it to their destination and find Muntz living in a zeppelin. They end up in a fight over the bird and, not to worry, this is a children's story, so all's well that ends well.","

The core story of Carl's adventure in his balloon-powered house together with stowaway Russell is exciting, involving, moral, funny (very funny!), and visually stunning.The 3D is used wonderfully effectively, but without being so in-your-face that you are always having your nose rubbed in it.But I must put my name down as one of those who was stunned by the opening sequence running from the newsreel footage of Muntz' initial exploration through Carl and Ellie meeting and then the montage of their life together. This exquisite sequence wasn't just great animation, it was - in my view - one of the all time great cinematic sequences, on a par with any of the classic sequences since the birth of cinema. In 10 short minutes it not only provided the exposition, it also conveyed a huge amount of information which paid off later in the film, and did both of these without you ever feeling that you were being spoonfed. And I can't recall the last time something moved me so deeply in the cinema.This movie is, simply, a work of genius.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","anselmdaniel","5 April 2022","I finally got around to watching this film after last year it being released. Since its arrival, it had many great things said from critics about it; saying how it was so good and all. Many promos had tags such as ""funniest movie of the summer"" and ""best Pixar film. These both lines are outrageously wrong. Up is nowhere near funny, it is actually quite depressing. They simply showed the funny scenes in the trailer but the actual movie was not funny. Right from the beginning, we see the old man as a kid being forced by his future wife (as a kid) to like him, and eventually it starts from there. They eventually get married, live a happily nice life then a few short scenes of pictures with background music, they show the wife dying in a hospital then there, she is dead. That's not funny.The characters weren't great. The old man was grumpy, and cruel. The kid was fat (a little under obese), bratty and annoying. He had privacy problems which was well showed in the film. The villain was boring and far too aggressive for a kids movie. Also there were talking dogs and a large bird. There were so many things confusing and not right about the film, such as some scenes that showed blood, and a scene with dogs attacking them. Also a scene where the villain captures and ties the kid (Russell) on a chair trying to kill him by sending him down a ramp (though the old man eventually saves him). I seriously don't see why this film was so praised, it is completely misleading and not great. Bland storyline, and uninteresting plot. It is vastly overrated, and shouldn't be in the top 250.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","erikgloor","24 September 2002","In terms of animated features, Pixar ventures where very few other animated films have gone before and that is to delve into the lives of the elderly generation. In fact, having any film (animated or not) examine what it is like to grow old and the roller coaster ride that is life would normally mean you are in for some heavy material indeed. This is because true depictions of life are not constantly joyful and grand, it is always hand in hand with tears and hardships. In this respect, Pixar are to be applauded to have dared create a ""kids"" film that explores the circle of life in all its vivid glory and personal heartache.Those who have scored UP poorly have undoubtedly felt misled, disappointed or even cheated because oftentimes when one thinks of Pixar, one thinks of imaginative explorations of what it would be like if our toys were alive (Toy Story 1 and 2), or if cars could talk (Cars), or if a mouse wanted to be a gourmet chef (Ratatouille), or how a family attempts to be ""normal"" when they all have superpowers (The Incredibles). Previous Pixar stories have always reached the realms of ""brilliant"" because these imaginative explorations are balanced with plot depth, humor and characters which audiences connect to and cheer for. Whether it's an ant trying to show his colony that they should stand up to the grasshoppers (A Bug's Life) or a humble cleaning robot guiding humanity home and trying to find love (Wall-E), all Pixar films are both fantastical and deeply meaningful thus showing their movies are more than just eye candy.And this is where UP has divided the people. Don't get me wrong, UP has the fantastical and the deeply meaningful in spades, the difference here is that Pixar explores these to the extreme.Flying a house to South America using thousands of balloons, dogs with futuristic collars that allow them to translate their ""dog"" language into English (or any other human language) and lest not forget they can also cook, a mythical rainbow colored bird and an old man who uses a walking stick in the first half of the film but can do ""Indiana Jones""-like feats in the second half of the film - Fantastical? CHECK.Boy meets girl, they fall in love, they marry, they discover they can't have children, they grow old together, wife dies, old man lives alone in house which he calls by his wife's name while high rise buildings are being constructed around him, old man attempts to fulfill promise to his deceased wife by flying to South America taking the house with him, and all that doesn't even cover the background story of the boy scout (who's father has left him and now only lives with his mum) who tries to help the old man out - Deeply meaningful? CHECK.The daring exploration by Pixar of both these fantastical and meaningful themes has resulted in a beautiful, at times humorous, oftentimes heart-wrenching and flawed (but not necessarily in a bad way) film.Never before has Pixar challenged the audience to such a level. Are you able to suspend belief to the point where you can believe a house can be lifted off by thousands of helium filled kids balloons and yet at the same time be willing to invest in an old man (who himself is flawed in more ways than one) and experience both the pain of love lost and the goal of hope found? Will parents be willing to explain to their young children about life and death? Will kids understand the adult themes? Will adults enjoy the ride or will they feel the movie is too depressing and the events too unbelievable? These are the questions which Pixar has dared audiences to confront.As for me, I enjoyed the film, I laughed during the bits where you're meant to laugh, and I was moved to tears during the bits where you were meant to be moved (especially the beginning which shows the fast forward life of old man Carl). I struggled at times with suspending my belief of the events in the second half; how both Carl and Russell (the boy scout) manage to do the physically astounding is not to be thought about in depth. All in all, a brave film by Pixar that doesn't quite reach the lofty heights of brilliance but if looked at from above has many lessons to be learned and perhaps, just perhaps examines the flaws in all of us (especially as we get older) and how we should all try to reach UP to greater heights.","

(Not just a bit of distort and crackle to make it sound old -- if anything, that's overdone -- but the singing technique and orchestration are spot-on for a pre-war popular record. Wish I could say the same for the rhymes, but 'adventure' clearly isn't the easiest couplet to complete..!) By having Carl as the principal character and his adventures triggered by his childhood fantasies, Pixar have very cleverly contrived to have their cake and eat it: to produce what is basically a 'Boys' Own' adventure full of lost jungles, unknown species, biplanes and giant airships, mad scientific gadgets and a reclusive genius -- something out of the ""Eagle"" magazine, right down to its action climax -- and yet to set it in what is supposedly the modern world of its juvenile audience. The 1931 newsreel with which the film opens is wonderful pastiche (and was that a visual reference to ""King Kong"", as adventurer Muntz prepares to reveal his latest discovery?), the two children and their games bring the period to life as the real existence of people just like us without feeling in any way anachronistic, and then the segment that follows demonstrates Pixar's effective use and command of an even earlier idiom -- the fluent story-telling of the *silent* film era.Too much has been written already on the impact and poignancy of this wordless love-story for me to be able to add anything to its praise. I would agree with the reviewer who wrote that it is very rare for films of any kind to depict the married love of adults, let alone to do it in animation so sweetly as this.But actually, the moment when tears came to my eyes was not during this segment at all, but the moment when the house takes off and Carl makes his defiant adventure/escape... (Shades of the Crimson Permanent Assurance!)I found most of this film very enjoyable indeed, especially the retro adventure feel and the dog psychology. What actually undermined it for me was not the surrogate-family-bonding scenario, which would normally have been anathema to me but is handled convincingly here, but the handling of the villain. Interestingly, reading comments on the IMDb boards suggests not only that I am not alone in this, but that the film's creators themselves weren't very sure right up to a late stage in production what to do with him -- the result is that the character, who could have been intriguing, is simply dropped into one-dimensional mode and wasted.I would have preferred a treatment more like the ending of ""Ratatouille"" (and would have preferred a beginning to ""Ratatouille"" more like this!; and for this idiosyncratic reason alone, which did significantly affect my enjoyment, I have rated it down one mark from the level of 9 (for ""deeply moving and exciting"") that it would otherwise have scored on my personal scale. Both films still score by my standards very highly.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","TheBigSick","14 September 2017","My Rating : 9/10A wonderfully-done animated film, as most Pixar films are. Edward Asner provides the voice behind Carl, a widowed elderly man who is being forced to leave his home for a retirement home. Instead of accepting his fate he floats his home away to try and get to Paradise Falls: a destination he wanted to go to with his wife. The montage of Carl and Ellie's relationship is both lovely and sad. Their relationship goes through many ups and downs, yet their love remains strong, even after Ellie's death Carl is dedicated to her. The brilliant script and animation are as always with Pixar films backed by an impeccable score. One of the best animated films of all time and more than worthy of joining Beauty and the Beast and Toy Story 3 as the only animated films to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Two thumbs UP!","

"SPIRITED AWAY","x_manicure_x","14 August 2021","Carl and Ellie meet and discover they both have the same dream of becoming explorers. They see newsreels of a daring adventurer named Charles Muntz, who is accused of faking a discovery of an animal unknown to man. He goes back to Venezuela, vowing to bring back the creature he claims he saw. Nothing is heard from him in years. Carl and Ellie grow up and marry. They buy an old house and fix it up. The two save up their money to go to Paradise Falls, but end up using the money for problems in life. It's present day and Ellie has died.This is all told in a beautiful but heart-wrenching montage that will make any human tear up. It's one of the best montage I've ever seen. However, the film focuses of Carl after the death of his wife. He is a recluse. After a problem has occurred, Carl decides to go to Venezuela, as a promise to Ellie. However, he's stuck with an 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer named Russell. Together, they embark in an adventure to a lost world, all brought to you by Pixar.Saying that ""Up"" is (yet) another masterpiece from Pixar is getting clichéd by now. At this point, Pixar can do no wrong. What they have done in the past several years was bringing films for all ages to enjoy. ""Up"" is the reason why people go see movies in the first place. Compared to other animated films, ""Up"" doesn't have innuendos for the older audiences. That's because it doesn't need to. This film is fantastic for all ages, the story appealing to many more people than the last two Pixar films.The rich story in ""Up"" may might as well be the most realistic from Pixar yet. It's poignantly told and there are things in life that are shown here that have never been shown in other animated films before. The characters are lovable and charming and are painfully and surprisingly authentic (well, except for the talking dogs, of course). The odd relationship between Carl and Russell grows as the film progresses. For the first time, the adult is smarter than the child. The film is also undeniably endearing. The film is so endearing, in fact, that you'll cry or choke up in at least three or four different spots in the film.I didn't see this film in 3D but I can tell you the film works well with or without the extra dimension aspect. The whole look of the film is just wonderful. The colors are exuberant and lively. The animation is pitch perfect. The story is nearly flawless, with some minor problems, including some talking dogs. The score by Michael Giacchino is sweet and lovely. The directing by both Pete Docter and Bob Peterson is really great. Wow, it seemed like every shot of the film moved the story along. Some scenes were hilarious too, filled with witty dialogue. The action sequences were impeccably crafted, I'll admit, including an excellent shot in the very first one.Overall, what I loved best about this movie are the characters and the story, the two most important aspects to any movie, in fact. The entire film just hits all of the right notes. With films being released these days, it's fantastic to see movies like ""Up"" are being released every once in awhile. I loved every minute of ""Up"" and I assure you will too. It's no surprise for me to say that ""Up"" is the best film of this year but I find it hard another film may be better than it.","

This movie had the charm of old school Disney movies. It's also no surprise that this was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. The characters were 100% likable and the movie was different like Hayao Miyazaki's films.Who would give this film a one-star rating?! Only people with no taste and Epic Movie lovers would hate this because those kind of guys are morons. Bottomline: A 10/10 movie with absolutely no flaws.

"SPIRITED AWAY","tonyhic","26 April 2003","Just watching this film on the box some while after it was originally screened, I had heard of it but not even seen as much as a trailer.I thoroughly enjoyed it and would heartily recommend it to everybody to watch.Enjoy and take off with Charles and Russell on their rollicking adventures.Seeing Charles Fredricksen on the movie's posters and possibly, on the trailer one may mistake him for a crusty old fart.Had I seen this film when I was much younger, I may well have made that mistake n error of judgement.But seeing it now at my advanced years of 72, I get a different perspective on it altogether.I may not be Charles age yet, but I am nearer to it than I am to Russell's.This has to be seen from the start the opening portion is essential, to be able to fully appreciate exactly who Charles Fredricksen is.We can then see his tale with his entire rationale the life he has with his soul mate Ellie, from their childhood friendship to old age.Anyone who has travelled that road can appreciate his life and loss, when she has finally gone from his world leaving only an existence.He may well have settled like so many others like him for a 'Retirement Village' but what a misnomer that phrase actually is.They are really nothing of the kind but actually one step away, from an old foggies mausoleum.Representing what so often occurs when you cross that portal, a gradual process of ossification.Charles Fredricksen is saved from that fate worst than death by nothing short of serendipity, but is it by the narrowest of margins.Who at any age especially at mine wouldn't wish to simply cast off the moorings, of your earthbound existence and float off to pastures new?","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Camoo","9 April 2007","'Up' has become only the second animated film in history to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. It did not win, but was the nomination worth it? It sure was.One thing I have always loved about the Disney production is that the movies they make show a tremendous amount of humanity. That is the essence of this. I absolutely adored the love story between Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) and his wife, Ellie. It opens up with them as children that aspire to explore the world, much like their hero, Charles F. Muntz (Christopher Plummer). They plan on one day travelling to the mystical Paradise Falls in South America--a promise Carl keeps. It then leads to a four minute montage of Carl and Ellie's lives together. At four minutes and silent, it certainly seems like a life well-lived. It goes through everything from them as children to the time of Ellie's death. Along with its lovely score by Michael Giacchino, this silent montage of life with Ellie is sure to make the viewer weep. We feel the effects of this scene long after it ends. Afterwards, faced with being forced to an old-age home, Carl decides to tie thousands of balloons to his house and float to Paradise Falls like he and his wife had always dreamed about. The house symbolizes Ellie helping her husband reach his destination. It is almost like her spirit inhabits the house. And with the thousands of balloons helping the house float, it is such a sight to behold. True beauty.Carl meets a child named Russell who wants to help Carl to earn a badge in assisting the elderly, much like an angel getting his wings. When the house floats, it takes Russell along for the ride. They wind up a distance from Paradise Falls, but must walk the house to their destination. Now here is where the movie gets silly: Russell wants to keep a unique kind of bird he calls Kevin, and they encounter a group of dogs with animal language converters that allow humans to hear the dogs speak English. They just annoy Carl to no end. Turns out Muntz, who is surprisingly still alive, has made new dog tools and has been seeking bird like Kevin for years. These action scenes with he dogs and Muntz run on much longer than needed. I gather that was just for the children. Luckily, none of it diminishes what we have come to love.Carl is a multilayered character that is easy to sympathize with. As a child, he was timid but still wanted to explore. After the death of wife, became more grumpy as his dreams of adventure dies. When his house floats, his yearning for adventure resume from where it was years ago. Carl is torn between his new responsibilities to Russell and wanting to fulfil his dream. He wonders what is more important: a house, or people? The arrival of Russell may make things harder, but the kid is someone Carl grows to love like the grandson he never had. And the bird, the dogs, and Russell may be the perfect ingredients for Carl to have the adventure of a lifetime.This thrilling, beautiful and hilarious adventure film it one the whole family can savour. Reasons for loving this may differ with the age groups, but nobody can deny the greatness that 'Up' possesses.4/4","

This is some nutty plot, but it works. The animation is superb, the story line quite touching. Ed Asner plays the widower and Chris Plummer is the bad guy.

"SPIRITED AWAY","Sinnerman","21 March 2002","I keep waiting for Pixar to let me down by delivering a good film that only disappoints by virtue of it not quite being up to the high standards set by previous films and, while Up is not quite as strong in some regards as some of their previous films, it is definitely a very good film that sits easily amongst their impressive catalogue. Up opens with a montage that spans about 70 years but yet succeeds in making you understand the main character and also feel for him and it makes it look like it was the easiest thing in the world to do. Without any pat sentimentality or exploitative tricks or cues, the film is quite moving from the very start and it means that the viewer is right there from the very start.It doesn't quite keep this up though because, although it does still have an emotional heart (thanks to the good work in the opening 10 minutes), the film is much more about the adventure. This does work really well even if it does all get a little bit silly as it goes along and adds talking dogs on top of flying houses etc, however the key thing is that you go with it , mainly because of how well it hooks you into the scenario from the very start. It also helps that on top of being exciting and engaging, it is also very funny indeed. Full of amusing aspects as well as specific funny jokes, the film doesn't separate some jokes for the kids and some for the adults but rather has good clean material with strong timing and delivery that makes it easily appreciable by the largest range of ages. The talking dog was my personal favourite but generally every character moved things along in regards action, drama and comedy.Needless to say the animation is brilliant. I did not see this in 3D but it is still gorgeous to behold, with the small personal effects being just as well done as the broad sweep of the fantasy scenario. The animation of the characters is great because it manages to convey such information in the tiny reactions or gestures of the characters – hard to imagine how one would do that in terms of capturing this performance detail not to mention the technical aspects. Asner does great voice work in the lead role, while Nagai does well to avoid being no more than an irritating ""cute kid"" but is actually a good presence. Peterson's timing as Doug is great while Plummer is suitably threatening and of course Ratzenberger gets a slot as normal.Up is a great film, probably my favourite of the year by some distance. The film hits the heart early with an impacting opening 15 minutes that sucks the viewer in and makes it look easy at the same time, then follows up with a solid slice of family-friendly adventure that is as thrilling as it is funny. Another in a succession of incredibly good films from Pixar.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","ultra_pro","11 November 2004","Widower Carl Fredrickson(voice of Ed Asner)feels like his time left could best be spent fulfilling the dream that he and his wife shared:namely,to fly off and explore the wilds of South America. A balloon salesman for a good part of his adult life,he decides to use his inventory to lift and carry away the old home that he shared with her for the forty some years they were together. And why not? The house is surrounded by a massive re-urbanizing development and there's considerable pressure on him to sell his beloved home. Rather than do that,he's set on taking his dreams in tact with him to do the things that he lived a lifetime putting off.The plans seem great. One hitch:a chubby,overly chatty World Explorer Scout named Russell,who is doggedly intent on helping Carl to finish his badge accumulation.The rest of the story is the main motor of this latest offering by the revolutionary studio. A struggle to navigate to the mythic falls point of the region(they miss the target,landing on the far other side of the plateau),as they are joined by a mythic wild bird and a voice-collar speaking hunting dog,defending against the hunting wishes of a lost explorer(voice of Christopher Plummer),whose singular vision to chase HIS aspirations have turned him into something g far less noble than he once was or appeared.This is a nice,sometimes inspired,sometimes funny,somewhat maudlin story that has nothing really wrong with it(save a suspension of disbelief over,among other things,the physics of a balloon-carried old-style home being carried,in tact,over thousands of miles). Director Pete Docter and co-writer,co-director Bob Petersen(who voices many of the dogs in the story,particularly Dug,the afore-mentioned dog that greets the intrepid travelers initially)supply a perfectly smart,engaging and entertaining film. I,personally,couldn't quite warm up to it as wholly as past PIXAR adventures(Toy Story,Buig's Life,Finding Nemo and WALL-E come to mind),but I still found this easily very entertaining and reasonably endearing(the dogs with talking collars particularly tickled me). Some rather depressing,adult themes and a longer-than-expected opening might test the patience of some,but this film largely is able to,like its title,stay buoyant throughout.","

It's an emotional roller-coaster of a film, which is a remarkable achievement in itself for an animated feature, but Pixar rarely fails to deliver.The story is wonderfully uplifting and the characters are engaging. It is very well written and of course the production is terrific like with all Pixar movies. 'Up' is also surprisingly funny - usually the humour in animated films isn't my thing but this one did make me laugh.

"SPIRITED AWAY","marijapetrovicfr","4 November 2020","""Up"" is a Pixar movie, directed by Pete Doctor and Bob Peterson, which they both wrote with Tom McCarthy too. It has a run time of 96 minutes and was released in the UK in 2009 with a U rating. Featuring the voices of Edward Asner, Christopher Plummer, and Jordan Nagai this is an absolutely charming movie that is suitable for both a younger audience looking for fun, and a more sentimental older audience that still has a sense of adventure too.Bespectacled Carl Fredricksen idolizes the famous explorer and adventurer Charles Muntz. He learns that Muntz was discredited after it was proved that he faked the skeleton of his recent find, but this does not dampen young Carl's spirits too much as one day he'd like to follow in his hero's footsteps. Muntz was last seen boarding his blimp to go in search of the real bird to salvage his reputation and career. Carl bumps into Ellie, a young girl who shares his passion for Muntz and they soon make a promise to one day follow in his footsteps and head out to Paradise Falls in South America. Carl and Ellie fall in love, they get married, they get jobs as Balloons salesman and a zookeeper respectively, and they grow old together blissfully albeit with some hiccups along the way. Realising that they have not fulfilled their ambition of moving to Paradise Falls Carl buys tickets and plans to surprise Ellie with them. Unfortunately, Ellie's declining health puts her in hospital and she eventually passes away, leaving Carl heartbroken and alone. Carl shuts himself away from the world and becomes a sour recluse - as an example, one day a boy scout called Russell comes calling, suggesting that he helps Carl out around the house so he can work towards his 'help the elderly' badge, but Carl tricks him with some silly task to get rid of him. The city which grew around Carl wants his house gone and eventually a court order wants to force him into a retirement home. Before he can be bundled away though the crafty old ex-Balloon puts a plan into motion which allows him to escape with his house - he uses as many balloons as he can get and floats the house away. Unfortunately, though, Carl is not alone, an accidental stowaway is with him - Russell, who was under the porch. They end up in South America where they meet a bird which Russell calls Kevin, they meet a talking dog called Dug, and they also meet Muntz. All of which, the bird, the dog, and Muntz are linked. If the adventure was not started when the house floated away, then it's definitely a-foot with Muntz back in the game.This film is beautifully created, the animation and colour palette is vibrant and gorgeous. The attention to, and presentation of detail is absolutely first class. The imaginative story is a fun adventure combining fantasy, comedy, suspense, and emotions. While it is fun for children to watch the floating house and the talking dog, this film is multi-layered too, and definitely one for adults too. I am not ashamed to admit it, but this film is an absolute tear-jerker at the beginning. I must be getting soft in my middle age, and perhaps too many horror films have broken me, but this film genuinely made me shed a tear. The voice acting in this is brilliant and really helps to compliment and bring to life the beautifully stunning imagery. In Carl, Edward Asner presents a grumpy but sweet and sincere old character who feels familiar to me. Jordan Nagai as the voice of Russell is enthusiastic and passionate and really drives life into old Carl again.Unless you don't have a heart of stone expect a roller coaster of emotions; you will laugh, you will cry, and by the end of the movie you will have experienced one of the best Pixar movies in my opinion. As well as being a box-office hit which easily recouped its budget (and then some!) this film has become a bit of a cult movie due to its heart breaking and then heart-warming ability. I am glad I got to watch this film and it has cemented a place in my movie collection for its content and its beauty. I am happy to recommend this to people of all ages, and I am happy to give this a solid 8 out of 10.","

Easter Eggs are bound to be found as this is just another part of the Pixar and Disney family.

Up is definitely known for the first 15 minutes, and I consider this as some of the best writing for an animated movie. When you're a kid, you don't know what's happening sometimes, but as you get older, you know that Carl has experienced a miscarriage and his wife dying, and he doesn't know how to handle it, hence why he gets really tense about moving to the retirement home and wanting to fulfil Ellie's dream of going to Paradise Falls. Up manages to combine humour, sad themes and adventure into one movie, and it is, in my opinion, the best Pixar movie of all time and definitely deserved that Best Picture Oscar nomination.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","jazzest","27 August 2004","Over the years, the studio has gone from heartfelt children's fare to more heady dramas—still with a youthful touch, but deeper and more resonate than your standard ""stick the kid in front of the screen and have quiet for a couple hours"". It began with Ratatouille, a tale so layered that you couldn't remember how vague and almost unappealing the trailer looked, followed by Wall-E, with its power of visuals and emotions overcoming the need for dialogue to tell a heartfelt love story. And now, in 2009, Disney/Pixar brings us one of their best yet with Up. The trailer and studio pedigree may have gotten me in the seat, but the story, barely touched upon in the teaser, is what kept me enraptured and wanting more.Going in, I was truly unaware of what was in store. My minimal knowledge from the advertisements was that it would tell the story of an elderly, crotchety old gentleman named Carl Fredricksen and his adventures traveling the world in his house, elevated and transformed into a blimp by hundreds of helium-filled balloons. Oh, and about him warming up to the young Wilderness Scout Russell who finds himself on Carl's porch at the time of liftoff. However, right from the get-go, we see how much more Up is going to be. We are first introduced to a youngster in a movie theatre, watching newsreel footage of his hero Charles Muntz and the adventures he took to South America's Paradise Falls. This young boy pretends to be his idol and stumbles upon a kindred soul in Ellie, a little girl dreaming of adventure as well. Through a lovely montage, we watch as these two grow up and become Carl and Ellie: a couple in love, heart and soul.What I love about Pixar is its ability to throw easy out the window and put the hardships and rough times of life on screen. Life is dirty and full of tragedy, but without those difficulties, the wondrous moments wouldn't be so worthwhile and memorable. Carl spies the money jar, he and his wife now very late in age, and decides to finally get two tickets to Venezuela and live their dream of traveling to South America. As happens, though, the moment he was going to surprise Ellie is the moment where she breaks down, needing to be hospitalized, soon passing on to the next world. Carl, without his better half, becomes a shut-in, wanting to be left alone in the house—the last piece of Ellie that he has. But, when an incident occurs, leading to his arrest and subsequent ruling to move to a nursing home, Frederickson decides to bring the house itself to Paradise Falls and once and for all do the thing he's wanted to for over half a century. And all this happens in just the first 30 minutes or so. There is no one that does cartoon exposition better than Pixar, their stories so intricate and endearing, every character—whether human, animal, or inanimate object come to life—becomes a fully realized creature.When the actual adventure portion of the tale begins, you are already fully engrossed in the journey, feeling for Carl and his loss and subsequent need to flee. As any old person trying to be left alone does, he becomes short and unfriendly with young Russell once the boy is let inside the ""ship"", and with future acquaintances such as Dug the dog and Kevin the bird, he attempts to be uncompassionate to and unwanting of them. Events in his past will show why he feels this way, but the love we see that he had for his wife and fervor for life previously tell us that he will soon warm up to those around him as Up is not only a journey of adventure, but also of rediscovering one's reason for living. Carl's passion and need to get out and travel is reinvigorated once he acquires someone else to give his heart to.Besides the wonderful story, Pixar once more shows how their studio is at the cutting edge of computer animation. They do not attempt to render realistic humans because they aren't trying to mimic live-action. Instead, they keep to a stylistic choice throughout, keeping a unique creativity while still holding a place in the real world. The filters used and authenticity to old photographs and scraps of newspaper in the Fredricksen's ""book of adventures"" is astonishing in its believability. I loved the aesthetic of Paradise Falls, including Kevin and his almost dinosaur-like bone structure, but completely bird exterior. Even the voice acting is inspired in its choices and successful across the board. Bringing in Ed Asner to handle Carl was a perfect marriage, giving the role a hard-edged growl, yet still allowing the softhearted soul to show when necessary. And young Jordan Nagai, playing Russell, is by far the best part of the film. His childlike naivety is believable and his speech pattern and boyish mannerisms allow the character to leap off the screen.Disney's partnership with Pixar definitely kept alive one of the best film studios around. Whether Pixar would have survived to tell the stories it has on its own is a question we won't need to find an answer to. No one else would think to include dogs with collars that allow him or her to talk, let alone have it done in such a disjointed and easily distracted way. The constant train of thought changes when a squirrel or ball come into their view is priceless and the unorganized speech, calling to mind Yoda, really hits home as being exactly how I would have thought dogs would think. The filmmakers got every detail right and show once more why their studio is at the top of cinematic animation and very well could be at the top of cinema as a whole.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","GiraffeDoor","24 April 2019","LOOOVED this movie.I found it so enjoyable to watch and actually had tears in my eyes from a particular scene which included a Doberman (won't say more). I also teared up from an emotional, tender scene with Carl and Ellie.The animation breathtaking, extremely funny and quirky too. It didn't pander to children i.e a kiddy movie, but made sure it entertained 'kids' of all ages.I actually wondered if the writers of this movie got together one night for pizza and beers and penned out this movie whilst a little intoxicated. It's got some seriously good laughs!Can't wait for it to come out on DVD.I highly recommend this movie.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","howard.schumann","3 November 2003","Up is a funny adventure with very well rendered and well animated 3D images. It delivers a message that we, irrespective of age, should never forget about dreams and are able to lead meaningful lives. It also sheds some light on the importance of letting go.However, some ideas are underdeveloped and puzzling. First, the relationship between the old man Carl and the kid Russell is not well-developed enough. Judging from Carl's indifference to Russell's visit, I do not feel his desire to have children after Ellie's death. Simultaneously, Russell's admiration for Carl as his role model can be further developed so that their very good relationship in the last two scenes can be better prepared. For example, what skills has Russell learned from Carl who used to be an adventurer? After watching the film, some may find the ten-minute Carl-and-Ellie love story much more touching and memorable than the Carl-and-Russell adventure. Second, Carl, who relies on an electric chair to move downstairs and staggers along with a stick, suddenly becomes so strong that he can even climb the ladder with his feet hanging in the air, which does not make any sense even in the created world. Third, it is too easy for them to ""float"" to Paradise Falls, a mysterious place, without scenes showing Carl's prior knowledge on aviation or science, which not only makes the plot contrived, but also the first-15-mintue adventure less exciting. Fourth, why and how does the bad guy invent a device helping his dogs talk with different languages? Fifth, the bad guy should be much older than Carl and I wonder why he is still alive and looks even younger than Carl. Sixth, why does the dog, a loyal animal, betray the explorer, even when he has the upper hand?On the whole, Up is interesting, visually stunning and suitable for kids to watch. However, the story and characters can be further developed. Wall-E, with robots who cannot speak, is more touching, while Bolt, a Disney animation, is funnier than this one with hundreds of dogs. Until now, my favorite Pixar film is still Finding Nemo. Toy Story 2 and Wall-E rank the second and the third respectively. The rest of my top five are The Incredibles and Ratatouille. Up, despite using two ordinary human beings as the main characters, lets me DOWN.","

Another part is a crass take on the Karate Kid without the wisdom. A loner kid of divorce is taken in by a senior citizen who blah, blah, blah (they fix/complete each other). Yet another part is the children's typical movie where kids stop the poachers and sing ""Kumbayah"". And we start off fast. In less than 12 minutes our idealistic and naive 8 year old boy meets his future wife, we watch their generational dreams go through life's twists and turns, and we're left with a grumpy 78 year old man who is a cab ride from being placed in a retirement home. Brutal. Kids have a hard time with this drama. ""Nowhere To Go But Up"" may have been a more meaningful title.Then comes the boy and then the adventure. The story is a modern family testament, where who ever can fill a family role is considered family. The void itself is predicated as victim hood which being connected to others helps fill. I like the drama, despite its obvious course,. I like the adventure despite its obvious course. I like the visuals despite.From victim to hero to a video store near you.

"SPIRITED AWAY","meetjopeblack","1 February 2005","'Up's' plot-line plays with the Pixar films' cross-generational appeal by having an oldster and a kid as its main characters. It's a buddy picture about the voyage of Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner), a 78-year-old widower, and Russell (Jordan Ngai), a chubby eight-year-old Asian ""Wilderness Explorer"" who wants to earn an ""assisting the elderly"" badge. The movie ""teaches"" us that we can still realize our life-long deferred dream of exploring South American wilderness if we can just attach thousands of helium balloons to our house and sail away. It's hard to say if up to then Frederickson's life has been fulfillment or disappointment. His wife Ellie (Elie Docter) was a childhood playmate who dreamed of emulating an explorer named Muntz (Christopher Plummer), who has found a prehistoric bird in South America's Paradise Falls plateau. They never go very far. Ellie, alas, can't have children. One day when they're both in their senior years she falls down and shortly thereafter dies. Fredrickson has had a career as a balloon salesman.The film sketches in the couple's life as sweetness and smiles, yet hints at a world of disappointment symbolized by Ellie's ""adventure"" scrapbook, which was never filled. Poor old Fredericksen won't move to a retirement home even though his little house is now surrounded by a vast loud construction zone. The demeaning practicalities of aging are depicted as something to escape from -- magically. When Fredericksen strikes an agent of the contractors and gets branded as a public menace he's somehow legally mandated to the old folks' home: this is the moment when he flies away, taking his house with him, with Russell a stowaway.There's no doubt about the exhilaration of an aerial escape, or the charm of the bond that develops between the old man and his dutiful, plucky little sidekick. But Up gets into deep trouble wit the arrival of the dogs, dozens of them, with electronic flashing collars that enable them to talk in squeaky (or sometimes deep) voices, in various languages according to what button you push. Forgive me, but I didn't buy it, and I just didn't see the need. Mr. Fredericksen is sold to us initially as a pretty feeble old man and so the strength and vigor he develops in South America is hard to accept. There's something to be said for a story that ends with the awarding of an explorer scout patch for assisting the elderly. All Russell really wanted to do was help the old man across the street, -- or even just across his lawn.I want to love Pixar films. Their animated features have moved from strength to strength. 'The Incredibles' was energetic and smart, 'Ratatouille' was witty and sophisticated, and 'WALL·E' wastranscendent and moving. Alas, Up does not live up to that standard.The house of Pixar has been declared triumphant in the field. Denby of The New Yorker heralds Pixar animations as examples of ""moral fable"" and damns the old Disney ones as mere ""psychological fables"" marked by ""cloyingness"" and ""malevolent overtones."" Well, Up is full of cloyingness and weirdness, and the latter part of its adventure has its fair share of malevolence. Up is a hugely overblown fantasy whose point is lost in endless violations of the laws of biology and physics. Pixar has its ups and downs, features different writers and directors, and to typecast them is dubious. What they have in common is a technology and a look. The look is mainstream, as is the sensibility. If you want something more artistically or intellectually adventurous, you'll go to French animations like 'Persepolis' or 'Fantastic Planet' or F'ear(s) of the Dark;' 'The Triplets of Bellville' blows away the similarly dark American film 'Coraline.' Eastern European animations have a fresher look. The world of Japanese anime is rich, fantastic, and frequently very adult or sexual; it seems to capture the original, fantasmagoric world of comic books better than American comic-based films like the Batman franchise. Likewise graphic novel films like 'Frank Miller's Sin City' go far beyond the tame confines of Pixar or Disney. An adult animation like 'Waltz with Bashir' is in another league.It's a bad start for 'Up' and not a step in the direction of technical or artistic innovation if you're forced, as you may be, to watch 'Up' in 3-D. The glasses, on top of your own, weigh upon and pinch your nose and the dimmed images with the planar levels they create are as flat and fake-looking as your grandmother's stereopticon slides. This Fifties movie gimmick with its chintzy throwaway plastic specs is unconvincingly heralded as the great new technology. It didn't do much for the creepy 'Coraline,' the fascistic 'U2/3D,' still less for the slipshod 'Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience,' and it only detracted from Zemeckis' watchable 'Beowulf.' 3-D is supposed to look incredibly real, but even granting this dubious claim, why use it for 'Up,' which flaunts its unreality? Its digital figures are like painted toys. Its Paradise Falls looks unabashedly like paper-mâché rocks and fake foam. The Pixar images pop out at you without the effect of 3-D imaging, the colors are brighter, and the experience is more absorbing. Why not let us use our own imaginations? There's some thrill of adventure in this movie, and certainly the titillation of swooping flights and dives through space, as well as the time-honored animation scare of teetering on a precipice, and going into free fall only to be magically saved. But this, compared to the best Pixar films, gets lost in its gimmicks at the cost of a meaningful tale. Of course a travel yarn is just one thing after another anyway, and there's' no harm in an adventure with the moral of a good deed attacked to it. But that's just what it is, though: attached. And how much richer were the worlds of 'WALL·E,' 'Ratatouille,' and 'The Incredibles'! 'Up' has less to offer to adults than they did.","

The stream of water is old and old, and the life of each other has been completed, and it can withstand any dream miss. Because of the stumbling block of memories, even if she died as a photo on the wall, even if he had changed from a young boy to a stubborn old man, he would have to take a once-used common hut and set sail for their childhood aspirations. The hut is the carrier of cherished memories, and the shackles of the closed heart. The adventure is a dream to get what you want. It is also a rebirth to reminisce the past. Because of a journey that has not been lost, this old man who has fallen into solitary life because of his love and death has experienced a new partner. The occasion, found a new fulcrum and new sustenance.
The first ten minutes of the film described Carl's most of his life and Allie's life. I think many people's lives are similar to the first part of the film. When we were young and ignorant, we all cherished dreams of ignorance. Slowly, we are slowly worn away by life's expectations and dreams.As Wang Xiaobo said, life is a slow process of being hammered, and finally it becomes like a hammered cow.Their love is always with them, no matter what happens, the two are snuggling and accompany each other.Ordinary life, but they live unswervingly, this is the simplest appearance of love. In fact, in addition to love, there are friendship, affection and nature's love. These are the seven emotions and six desires that run through a person's life. We all have to face, Carl handed over the answers to his life questionnaire about love.Yes, Carl has become an old man, but with his love and dreams, his heart is full of blood, he was still the dream chasing boy. I think, as long as people remember their original dreams, it's never too late to start. May we run away for half our lives and return to our youth.Regarding adventures and dreams, an old man talks about the story of a young maniac, and the dream youth and memories of an adult. The ten-minute short film and the adventures and love of Carl and Ellie throughout the film are enough to become classics, making the main line of the film seem bland. Life is an adventure, the end of this journey is not a great spectacle, but walking with you","

"SPIRITED AWAY","asandor","14 July 2015","After tackling rats with chef skills and voiceless robots on journeys of self-discovery, leave it to Pixar to make the star of its latest film an elderly man and continue to defy Hollywood's long-held belief that animated films have to zero in on children and concepts that can be marketed into hats and toys and backpacks. Heck, in ""Up"" even animals talking are explained rather than simply taken for granted. But what sets it apart from other Pixar gems is that it's the animation studio's most inclusive for-the-whole family adventure to date.It's no surprise to anyone anymore that Pixar leads field in terms of computer-generated animation and while ""Up"" continues this tradition, that's not its specialty. ""WALL*E"" is still more of a spectacle and innovator. ""Up"" is Pixar's proof that they can combine beautiful, heart-filled storytelling with laughs for every age group and adventure and action to boot and *still* make a killing at the box office.On premise, most analysts wouldn't predict a film about 78-year-old Carl Fredricksen ballooning his house to South America to honor a promise to his late wife to be even close to a box office success in the genre of animated family films, but attach the name Pixar and anything is possible. Dogs with collars that turn their thoughts in words and the dynamic between a young boy scout named Russell who accidentally was on Fredricksen's porch when the house took off and an old man prove to be more than enough for great comedy and entertainment.Sure, the plot itself once they get to South America leaves something to be desired, and the feasibility of an old man who can't walk down his stairs being able to hold onto a dangling rope with a boy, a dog and a large bird on the other end will fail to suspend many adults' disbelief, but there is never a moment devoid of something clever or meaningful in the entire film. The fresh and humorous concept proves quite forgiving as does the touching motivation in the story of Carl doing this for his dead wife. The montage through their years together is incredibly powerful for happening so early in the film. Pete Docter and Bob Peterson do an excellent job, though obviously Pixar's constant success must be credited to John Lasseter. Next to ""WALL*E"" whose innovation, imagination and genius themes might never be repeated in animated film, ""Up"" is Pixar's best to date. There is honestly something for everyone: the elderly will relate to Carl's struggles with aging, loss and unfulfillment; children will find plenty of physical humor to enjoy between the hysterical dogs and Russell's slight lack of smarts; and the ages in between will find the story touching and the concepts and their execution nothing short of genius. And for once, Disney is even politically correct/inclusive in the diversity of characters.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Rectangular_businessman","17 June 2010","One day, Pixar might make a film that will just fail to be decent. Fortunately, Up is not that picture. While the story is a little fragmented, this still remains a marvel of animated storytelling that continues the Pixar legacy of releasing solid 3D animated films.The story begins with Carl as a child and we quickly watch his relationship with Ellie, through its various phases, through its untimely end. And then we pick up again as Carl decides to make his late wife's dreams come true. He launches his house into the sky via a ton of balloons, but manages to pick up a young Wilderness Explorer named Russell and then his goal gets derailed from there. Along the way, we meet a few other kooky characters, hilarity ensues and we end on a nice note. First of all, I think Up contains some of the most mature themes and story elements of all of their films so far, especially as we watch Carl and Ellie's life together in fast forward. I don't know how much children will fully comprehend what was going on, but despite the brevity, I still found some of the moments to be borderline tearjerkers. One downside to the story is that it's essentially fragmented and requires that ""life with Ellie"" at the beginning, but overall, the ""quest averted"" concept works very well to help bring out Carl's character. Russell does cross into the land of affably annoying and at times it's difficult to retain sympathy for him due to all the trouble he causes, despite his innocence.The art is pretty classic Pixar, clean with lots of attention to detail and the animators definitely display their considerable skill in getting the characters to display various degrees of emotions. Voice actors do a great job with their characters, even the rather simple characters. Music is used well, even if it's not hyper-memorable.Ultimately, Up falls into line as a good Pixar film, just under the tier of great Pixar film. Of course, a good Pixar film tends to mean a great film otherwise and I won't hesitate to recommend it to anyone. 8/10.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Animany94","26 August 2017","Technically this is a wondrously perfected piece of animation. Seen in 3D it is on occasion very close to real - the coat of one of the dogs was very lifelike for example. As an entertainment I don't think its intended audience is really children. It's for parents and other adults who are generally child friendly. The story effectively pokes and evokes emotional responses. I cried at one point and it was evident to me that the whole audience at the cinema I attended were also similarly affected. This is an incredible feat for animation - but not unknown. The heavy emphasis on sentimentality however, I found detracted from the Lost World Adventure story that it should really have been about. Admittedly, the Venezuelan scenes were beautifully done, the was even a rainbow on the waterfall - as occurs in life, the subdued mood created by the first segment of the film could not be erased. It's a lovely piece of work - but don't go with a child who has recently lost a grand parent.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","JG2001","17 September 2002","Saw it on DVD, great sound and great picture.From PIXAR, the same group that gave us one of my favorites, ""Monsters, Inc"". Although the two movies are quite different, one might even say totally different, I will compare them. Each has a very compelling story to tell, and the superb animation and voice acting are present to support the story. Many of the animated movies in recent years have looked superb, but suffered from very marginal stories.In ""UP"" we see what can best be described as a love story. Two kids meet quite randomly, and long before they know what ""love"" is really all about, but they turn out perfect for each other. They get married, make plans for the adventures they want in live, grow old together, and find that somehow ""real life"" has gotten in the way of their dreams.All this we see in the first few minutes of the movie. It sets up the fantasy, that an old man just living out his life can attach enough helium-filled balloons through the chimney of his little house to not only float up into the air, but also float to South America to a spot that he has dreamed about since he was a small boy. Our logic says this can't really happen, just as our logic tells us children don't really have power-generating Monsters in their closets at night. But this movie is not about logic, it is a fantasy.This is an interesting, exciting movie with superb animation. But the real pay-off is in the love story, which isn't totally wrapped up until the very final image we see.SPOILERS: As the young couple were growing up, they had an image, a hand-drawn picture which they placed on a photograph of the cliffs and waterfall in South America. The hand-drawn image was of their little house they dreamed of building on that site some day. That day never came. But through his perseverance and as the helium in the balloons finally lost their ability to keep the little house off the ground, it settled down to that very spot they had imagined all those years. He had finally given his wife, now deceased, the little house on the cliff.","

It's all about doing what you always wanted to do and it's very good.Ed Asner provides the voice of the old codger Carl and I liked him more than I thought I would.

Come on, it will lift your spirits up! OK, enough uppers already! Do not want it to be a downer for you guys. ""Up"" is yet another creative Pixar tale about a lonely geriatric widower named Carl Frederickson who fixates on fulfilling his deceased wife Ellie's wishes of flying their house to a paradisiacal land in South America. This idea might not fly with many, but grumpy Carl just wants to be happy by his lonesome in his own isolated South America Paradiso. However, Carl did not expect a junior wilderness explorer to come along for the ride. What's up with that? Russell is the aforementioned boy scout who accidentally gets stuck in the house during Carl's upward liftoff. Nevertheless, Frederickson was in no mood to be ""bringing down the house"" even with Russell on board. Frederickson and Russell end up landing in the paradise land (house and all), and there they befriend a talking dog named Dug and an eccentric female bird who Russell names Kevin. Their nemesis comes in the form of the devious explorer Charles Muntz who masters a pack of menacing talking dogs. So therefore, Frederickson and Russell are confronted with plenty of ""ups"" and ""downs"" during their adventurous experience. There are many humanistic elements in ""Up"" such as aging, loneliness, acceptance, and detachment that many kids might not be up for; but provides invaluable life lessons on character education to our future generation. ""Up"" does play with your heartstrings plenty, so bring a hanky! The former Mr. Grant, Ed Asner, was granted a perfect role to voice as Frederickson; that impressed me Ed Asner! (Only ""Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" fans got that pun upper). Bob Peterson's tender & uplifting screenplay was superb while Pete Docter doctored a successful directorial uperation of ""Up"".

"SPIRITED AWAY","markmarukka","18 April 2022","The movie up is great for both adults and children. The theme of the movie is much clearer to adults but the fun music and colors and amazing animation throughout the film intrigues its children's viewers. The director and editor have created a flawless film that will be a classic for many years in my book!The editing is spot on. It seems to be smooth and natural from beginning to end. The scenes fade in and out creating a natural movement throughout the movie. The editor uses a creative juxtaposition in the beginning of the movie by creating a montage. This allows for time compression and cohesion in the movie as well. The montage is of the characters Carl Fredrickson and Ellie Fredrickson. In the montage the viewer can see how the 2 characters met as children and fell in love. It shows how they grew up and got married bought a house and found out that they could not have children. It shows how they grew old and finally how Ellie passes before Carl.This portrays Carl in a more human way. Without this montage the viewer would only see a cranky old man who was mean and did not want to go to a new home. However, because of the montage the viewer has sympathy for Carl. They can understand that this was his home with his wife who he misses. He feels like he failed her by not giving her the adventure of paradise falls and he is holding on to his home in memory of her. This is very effective in developing the plot of the movie.Sound is also used to provide smooth transitions in the film. There are times when the music used is a happy upbeat tone and then slow and sad when Russel thinks that Carl is going to leave him and not allow him to help. The music in the end of the film as it shows Carl and Russell's new relationship is happy and upbeat. It allows the view to increase their emotional connection to the scenes being portrayed in the film. The bright colors are faded in and out during these transitions as well all tying in the viewers emotional connection.The them of the movie can be seen as adventure and love but also forgiveness. Carl must learn that while Ellies adventure was not Paradise falls it was their life together. Carl must have this adventure with Russel to forgive himself and learn to be happy in the everyday moment!","

"SPIRITED AWAY","xcutepandax","7 February 2012","The newest Pixar movie is infuriatingly near perfect. Don't get me wrong, its a good movie, but its one of those movies where if you can work out the perfect way the story should go- thats what you'll see. The opening montage of the life of Ed Asner's character with his wife is as damn near a perfect arc of a life as you'll likely to see...and the tears come exactly on cue. through much of the film when you see certain visual images or verbal references, you realize that you'll see them later on. Its a perfectly constructed film, possibly the most perfectly constructed film that Pixar's made, but at the same time it's the most artificial. Pete Docter has fashioned the most perfect of animated, nay, of any films from all of the best stuff in the world and he forgot one key thing, heart and emotion, real heart and deep emotion. Yes I was moved and yes I was carried along, but at the same time I didn't feel completely part of it. I didn't really feel the real emotion. I didn't feel the emotional connection of Wall-e and Eva, I didn't feel the joy of Peter O'Toole's food critic at the end of Ratatouille. the ""Claw is our Master"" in Toy Story is still better then ""look a squirrel"". I know I've complained about almost every Pixar feature, but even in the bitching there was real emotion and not manipulated emotion.I'm annoyed, I wanted to cry at the end, I didn't.It is one of the best of the Pixar movies, but I liked it I didn't love it.(And yes while the casting of Christopher Plummer is choice, they shouldn't have made him look like Kirk Douglas unless they were going to use Douglas. I know Douglas has medical problems but, damn it would have been nice to hear him leaping into action.) (and perhaps the one real flaw...too many dogs)","

"SPIRITED AWAY","marialiiva","27 March 2020","Pixar and Disney have again come up with the goods with the funny and touching movie.The first ten minutes show a young Carl Fredriksen (voiced by the legendary Edward Asner), fascinated by the explorers he sees on newsreels. He meets a kindred spirit in Ellie and we see their life together until she passes away. This segment lets us see Carl's character and is very moving.Carl continues to live alone in his house until a run in with a developer sees him destined to be shipped off to a retirement home. Facing this prospect he decides to go to Paradise Falls, an almost mythical place he and Ellie had always meant to go to but never did.Here the film really takes off (see what I did there?) as Carl opts to travel via his balloon-fuelled house. Only when he is in the air does he find that a boy scout in search of a last merit badge for helping the aged has become an unwitting stowaway.Our odd couple eventually land near their destination but trouble awaits as they cross swords with an unexpected jungle resident.I didn't see the 3D version but the animation is still brilliant with the colours of the jungle amazingly vibrant. The story is also excellent. We empathise with Carl and his young friend as they reveal their stories and come to rely on each other. The chase sequences are straight out Indiana Jones and breathtaking (even in non-3D). While there is a ""message"" it isn't rammed home at the expense of making the film enjoyable.One small complaint would be the film is perhaps too long at over 90 minutes and dragged a bit towards the end. So, while it is not as good as the peerless ""Toy Story"" it is a very enjoyable film for all ages and well worthy of being listed with the other Pixar classics.","

I trust you.When do we start not to believe in love, when do we start not to talk about permanence, when do we start to worship the material stripped of the faith in love itself. We're used to getting into and out of one relationship after another, and seeing it as an exercise in love. Our world is too impetuous, impetuous to no heart to seriously manage a life - long relationship.However the reality that we say on the lips can not cover up however the longing of heart to everlasting and everlasting, that kind of holding hands and children together in the day after day years of the warmth of the precipitation down bit by bit. Through the morning sun, if the person sleeping around us is never changed, I think it will be the most perfect gift from god to us.UP is for those who still believe in love, but the warm picture makes people unable to stop tears. Let me take the risk with our dreams, the cross across my heart is my lifelong commitment to you. I want our house to be rooted in Paradise Fall, the place you've always wanted to go, and I want to help you fulfill your childhood aspirations.
But when I finally got to the place you've always wanted to be, I found out that since you met me, your adventure ended up with me for life.
Thank you for the life-long adventure.See here, tears streaming down my face.We do not need another irrelevant person to practice love, we do not need to follow the outside impetuous to toss about love, we do not need a dare not long for the everlasting person to spend our love. It's not love.I met you in a crowd of thousands of people, and I fell in love with you for a long time. This is a chance that everyone has several times in a lifetime. If it happens, then you fall in love with me, too. Then this may be the most beautiful gift that god has given me.So, let such a feeling back to nature, let the early morning sunshine on your face, let the passage of time quietly engraved in your brow, let the accumulation of years bloom a consistent gorgeous love.If I fell in love with that person, or that person fell in love with me. Please work hard on this relationship. It's a long, long life adventure, but as long as you're here, I have the courage to make it happen.Or maybe in the end we can't be together for life, but as long as the heart has been believing in love, then we once the adventure will become a memory that will never fade, hidden in the memories.This is a movie for people who still believe in love, in the adventure of a lifetime, that you may be my end.Thanks to the movie UP, which was almost missed, we can still find the love that was almost forgotten by us in the noisy world. Also thanks for sliding through the eyes of tears, let us find that the original shed hypocrisy and secular we still long for a lifetime of happiness.I believe in love,
Because I believe in you.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Harmaa_Hevonen","7 September 2003","Pixar has, in my opinion, delivered the finest computer animated films to date. However, Pixar's three entries before this film (""Cars,"" ""Ratatoille,"" and ""Wall-E"", though most people will disagree with me on the last one) were, I feel, lesser entries. The last three did not have the overall appeal value that the previous films (""Toy Story,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" etc) had. ""Up"" is a pleasant surprise in nearly every way. What a fantastic concept this film has, featuring a house floated away by a massive amount of small helium-filled balloons (I mean, who doesn't think it would be neat to have their house fly?) Of course, a great concept deserves an equally well-written plot and screenplay, and this film pulls off both of those. The film involves Carl, an old man trying to keep his late wife's dream alive by going to Paradise Falls to prove that their childhood hero, explorer Charles Muntz, was not lying when he said he had traveled there. Along the way, he picks up a young boy scout and a few animals to continue the journey together. This film features who is probably the all-time greatest movie dog character, Dug, a dog who says just what he thinks due to his automated voice collar. What a brilliant concept, rather than the overused one involving animals talking with moving lips. There's too much to share about this film in one review, but the most important thing to say is that I recommend it. It's visually stunning and full of laughs, excitement, and real emotion, with characters we learn to care about. If you're one of the few people who hasn't seen it yet, now's the time, while it's still in theaters.***1/2 out of ****","

"SPIRITED AWAY","willwoodmill","14 February 2016","Last year's Pixar production had the best possible reviews, I remember going to see WALL*E expecting to experience what for many people it was: the very best Pixar film. I loved WALL*E as much as you fellow reader but I don't consider it the very best Pixar film, it is not even one of my 5 favourite Pixar films, hell I haven't felt desires to buy/rent its DVD, I haven't felt desires to watch it for the second time. I just saw Pixar's latest production (in 3-D and it looks, as expected, just wonderful!) Up (Peter Docter directed it being his second Pixar film. His other, the 2001 Monsters Inc., is my second favourite from Pixar) and for me is just as wonderful as WALL*E and Ratatouille (another film I haven't seen since I saw it for the very first time on the big screen back in 2007) but like those two films it is not one of my most favourites from Pixar.Anyway, the preview I saw of Up didn't allow me (thankfully) to see any characters but only the main ones: the old man Carl Fredricksen (voice of Edward Aisner) and the kid Russell (Jordan Nagai), the preview showed the old man with his floating house and later realizing that he had a guest. But Up actually begins when Carl was younger than Russell, when Carl met Ellie (Elizabeth Docter), the girl that just like him loved adventures, loved exploder Charles Muntz, the girl that eventually became the woman of his life. All of what Carl and Ellie shared is fantastically told, is realistic, touching, is a really great part of the film. The director Peter Docter said this: ""the message of the film is that the real adventure of life is the relationship we have with other people, and it's so easy to lose sight of the things we have and the people that are around us until they're gone. More often than not I don't really realize how lucky I was to have known someone until they're either moved or passed away. So if you can kind of wake up a little bit and go, ""Wow, I've got some really cool stuff around me every day"", then that's what the movie's about"". Ellie passes away, then we move to the present with Carl, the present is still realistic and also sad, no country for old men certainly, the destiny of Carl is to go to a retirement home but then the extraordinary begins, then the dream of Ellie as kid of having her clubhouse in Paradise Falls is the one and only objective of Carl and well Carl will not leave his house and is satisfying as hell! Like almost everybody I knew that at one point Carl was going to use lots and lots of balloons to make his house fly so for me the ""weird"" stuff began once Carl and Russell (he is a hilarious character, you will love him and well he being a wilderness explorer was trying to earn the ""assisting the elderly"" badge ended in Carl's house) arrive to South America, I was like ""talking dogs in the middle of the jungle?"", this stuff with the dogs is really hilarious. It works like with the elderly (Carl certainly and also Charles Muntz, yes Carl will meet his hero who now owns the bunch of dogs and lives in Paradise Falls just to capture a weird bird that Russell calls Kevin!), I mean on one hand we have the extraordinary: talking dogs, all the amazing movements that Carl and Russell do in the course of the film, the dogs being chefs, etc. And on the other hand we have the realistic moments (apart of those from the beginning of the film, from the story of Carl and Ellie) : the dogs being totally controlled by that who has the ball or the food, the elderly having problems to fight (hilarious scene!), etc. The deal is that the film always works, and well Up is just another triumph for Pixar! 9.5 out of 10","

"SPIRITED AWAY","schanzaysohail","12 February 2021","And they don't disappoint at all with this outing. It's probably not their best work. That's Wall-E. It's not as tightly plotted as other Pixar flicks, and the villain, in particular, could have used more work. But so what? Really, I haven't enjoyed a movie this much since, well, Wall-E. The prologue of this film, especially its second sequence, a completely silent (except for score) exploration of a long, beautiful marriage that gives us a novel's worth of information in a mere 8 minutes, is so remarkable that I could not hold back tears. In a way, that's a minor flaw as well. The film never quite tops those first 10 or 15 minutes. But the remaining 70 or 80 minutes are a ton of fun, and touching in their own way. Pixar shows Disney that cute animal sidekicks can be completely charming and hilarious. Dug the dog who talks with his special collar is constantly hilarious, as is the goofy bird, nicknamed Kevin. Like I said already, the villain is weak and could have been more thoroughly characterized. But it's not too bad - that's made up for with his more villainous talking dogs. Villainous they certainly are, but the way they talk, still thinking like dogs, is always worth some big laughs. And there's also a cute kid who is in no way annoying. Pixar proves once again that it has more imagination, wit and charm than anyone else working in the medium today. And that medium is not animated features, but cinema itself.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","robertrutledge","27 August 2021","After living in his home for most of his life, Carl is suddenly surrounded by skyscrapers and construction. They want to buy his house so they can tear it down and build a retirement home. He will have none of this and decides to use thousands of balloons to literally lift his house 'up' and soar to a place he's been dreaming of going since a kid.There's a bit more to the plot, but I don't want to divulge that information. Going into the film not knowing about it might have a stronger impact on you. Up, which is yet another fascinating film from the geniuses at Pixar is vibrant with colour, full of laughs, tugs on the heart strings and is an adventure for both kids and adults. I never thought a film that had to really old characters in the lead roles would appeal to the young ones, but Up surprised me. In fact, it really surprised me, hearing about the concept I thought that Pixar finally had a dud on their hands. Nope, not this time.Up is one of my favourite Pixar films, up their with last years Wall-E and The Incredibles. The film is unique and inspiring. I doubt you'll find such quality film making from any other animated film, Pixar has set the bar time and time again. Up, while not visually stunning or powerful as last years Wall-E takes a different route and uses vibrant colours to draw attention to itself. The characters are cartoonish and the story itself could never be based on any reality and for a film about an old guy in a house with balloons, it's mighty adventurous.Every Pixar film has a message that their cleverly slip into the excitement and Up is no different. We go on this journey with Carl and the young boy scout Russell, Carl at first does not like Russell, nor does he want him around. These two characters are at opposite ends of each other, one old and quite, the other young and talkative. Of course by the end of the flick they bond. Also along for the ride are two side characters, Kevin the colourful native bird of Paradise Falls (they place Carl wants to finally see) and Dug, a dog who can mysteriously talk. Dug is not the only dog who can talk though, the place is full of them, all trained to open doors and fly planes. They all heel to their master Charles Muntz, who has spent his life trying to capture Kevin.Up is not only funny, fun and exciting, it packs a few emotional scenes too. Some people might want to bring some tissues, while it's not a sob story it is one of the few Pixar films that have moved me. What happens to Carl happens to everyone, so you can relate to him. You are immediately grabbed by him and his story and the film has more emotional punch in ten minutes of dialogue free montage then most dramas or romance films today can say for themselves.There are a lot of words to describe Up: Delightful, endearing and whimsical are a few, but one I will choose to employ is heart. Along with Wall-E, Up has the most heart out of every other Pixar film I've seen. The film has a PG rating though, only other Pixar film to have this is The Incredibles. The Russell kid is shot at and people die, at times I was thinking would kids be scared of this? I don't think so, nothing horrible ever happens that could traumatize a young one in my opinion.I did not bother to see this film in 3-D, I've heard it doesn't give enough 'pop' to warrant the additional money on the ticket. Seeing it at a regular theatre will not hinder your viewing at all. All the voice acting is top-notch and perfect casting with Plummer and Asner. See Up in theatres while you can, it is one of the year's best.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","InzyWimzy","21 September 2002","Saw it in Bangkok in 3D, found it overwhelmingly touching for a cartoon. If the movie can keep you concentrate on its sentimental side for the whole 2-hours ride, it surely can make you think it's the best animated film ever made(as currently at Top 18 of IMDb Top 250). The film doesn't falls short in technical aspects. The characters, objects and everything are animated in a way that they're not bound by the physics rules. The scenes are not so different from a combination of The Incredibles and Cars, but they are assembled professionally and made their own credibility. You can prematurely conclude that a movie casting an old fart as the main character may not be vividly colorful, but that definitely is wrong. You will find the color of good old days' memory, color of freshness and color of life in Up, and you don't have to try to get it.The story, basically the same formula implemented by Pixar, has indeed succeed again. After Wall-E and Up, we can safely say that, there are not any common senses that Pixar dare not break. So don't argue about how many balloons can bringing up a house, or how was the house floating so steady without proper operation, or how did another old fart get the technology of a dog voice box after locking himself in mountains half a century. Just sit and take it for what it is and enjoy. Family ingredient is the true star of Up, which took me to tears twice in the first 20 minutes. If ever you get a stubborn but loving family member, you will cry too. And after all, it's the sentimental value that saved its climax and ending from being a run-of-the-mill fun.However, there is always a however. Since Pixar made Wall-E, Up will not escape from being compared to Wall-E. The screenplay of Wall-E totally blew me away from beginning to the end, but Up's energy is halfway leaking like the balloons on the house. The fist act, so touchingly executed, totally promised too much for the rest of Up to bear. After Charles became a menace, the movie became predictable at all. You can tell the bird tried to escape but failed, the old man has to struggle between his house(a symbol of all the sentimental value summed up) and the righteousness(saving the bird), you can also tell what choice he's gonna make and how he's gonna overcome his own issue. It's also obviously rigid that the writer tried to combine old Carl's emotion breaking through and the rescue mission. At last, it's sad for me to find it predictable because it's like suddenly waking up from a beautiful, touching dream.But, this doesn't prevent the whole cinema from laughing through the movie and appreciate the efforts makers put in it. This is still, a great film in every aspect.You definitely need to bring your family to it. The children will learn, the elders will sigh and sob, and all of them will enjoy. Sometimes it has a darker and heavier undertone than Wall-E, but the final result is still as up-beating as a balloon.8.5/10 A fierce competitor in Oscar, but may be beaten this time.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","MyOpinionIsFact","26 May 2003","I loved ""Up"": it is a great movie with some touching moments and a fantastic score. In particular the most impressive thing is the narration of the love story between Mr. Fredricksen and Ellie that is powerful even without a word because of the music and of the inspired images. The general idea of the movie is very original and the plot does a great job in entertaining the viewer. The characters are relatable and well characterised. It would have been truly an amazing movie if not for those dogs. They are so frustrating because they are so childish in a bad way. Being for children is not a problem and indeed I love animated movies but these dogs were terrible and they are used like the random NPCs you have to fight against in every videogame. And this is very bad because the messages that the movie tries to convey are important and mature and the dogs are really out of place. Even with this problem ""Up"" is still a great film you should watch at least once!","

"SPIRITED AWAY","lee_eisenberg","28 December 2021","Much has been said about the opening montage, and I fully agree that it's an extremely touching sequence in itself, bringing out and establishing the lonely character of Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner), a man living out his twilight years, finally deciding to take the plunge and fulfill a lifelong dream and a promise made. If the first few minutes doesn't make you cry, then you must have a heart of stone, or never loved before.What transpires in the film is more or less captured in the trailers already, with Fredricksen lifting up his home with thousands of helium filled balloons, off for his adventure of a lifetime, only to find a stowaway, little wilderness explorer Russell (Jordan Nagai) scared stiff on his front porch. While the boy offers to become Carl's sidekick for that final badge of honour to be promoted to senior explorer, little did he know that he too is up for a crazy adventure in South America, joined by a talking dog Dug (Bob Peterson) and an endangered bird, to Carl's dismay as they detract him from his mission.While seemingly implausible in many ways (for instance having the flimsy contraption the size of a house with perishable balloons survive a mean thunderstorm), in order for the narrative and plot elements to work, you have to accept what's going on with a pinch of salt. Pixar has so far never disappointed me with its films, and Up continues the company's successful box office juggernaut by reminding everyone that it's all about the story first, the strong characters next, and animation just going about getting the job done.It's a moving tale about loss and the prospect of letting go. Essentially it's a Carl Fredericksen story, where through the interaction with his new found friends, as opposed to fiends such as contractors and developers eyeing his property, discover new meaning to life, and a second chance for that sense of adventure that's been buried by life's unfortunate ups and downs. While a chapter has been closed in his earlier life of companionship, herein lies another opportunity to live out a new adventure, no point sitting around and mope in self pity. It's quite uplifting in that it's full of hope, yet dishes out enough nostalgic reminiscence that makes you all warm and fuzzy inside.There were two moments that I particularly enjoyed, outside of the opening montage. The first was that parallel with The Fountain, where one is tasked to complete a beautiful experience by making new ones, on one hand never to forget, but on the other never to make a crutch of an excuse out of it, and to move on. The second was how life as depicted unfolds itself in phases, where the unexpected can crop up and derail even the best of intentions and plans. But so long as you have someone to share the spoils with, good and bad, then perhaps everything else is tolerable.If there's a complaint about the quality of the 3D here, then I must say that amongst all the 3D live action and animated ones shown here to date, Up is unfortunately most disappointing of the lot because there wasn't much sequences that maxed out its 3-dimensional ability. You might just be better off with the 2D version, to save some cash for films that are truly designed to envelope your senses, rather than just to provide some depth of field.Up is utterly moving, a romance story if you'd like in its inner core, filled with plenty of lovely moments that never lose you, and punctuated with adequate and well timed comedic. The short film that preceded Up, called Partly Cloudy, also served as a great appetizer to the feature, and reinforces the notion that a simple tale about a stork and a cloud that addresses the perennial children's question on where do babies come from, and without dialogue at that, can still move you if told in a way that's sincere and full of heart.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","pukingtorture","23 June 2022","Up begins with a poignant montage of our protagonist Carl Fredricksen (the unmistakable voice of Ed Asner) and his partner Ellie as they meet as fledgling broods, only to fall in love. Thrown together by a shared spirit of adventure, particularly the escapades of a spirited explorer Charles Muntz who dazzled the world with his discovery of Paradise Falls, Carl and Ellie are forced to shelve their plans to move to this ""exotic lost land"" as life, as always, gets in the way. We watch the couple deal with the ups and downs, joys and tragedies of life; and gradually we watch them grow into old age, Ellie's 'My Adventures' scrapbook still unfilled, even as her time on Earth ends. This wordless, eloquent, effortlessly heart- breaking sequence is sure to melt even the iciest of hearts.With Ellie gone, Carl becomes a crusty codger, faced with moving to retirement home for the rest of his days. But he has another idea, one involving the inflatable leftovers of his previous career as a sidewalk balloon vendor. He decides to honor the promise he made to his dearly departed adventure-loving wife and take one last shot at adventure! Carl hitches thousands of helium balloons to his rickety old house, rigs a steering system and 'Up' he goes. But he is not alone. There's a pint-size accidental stowaway aboard: Russell (an endearing Jordan Nagai as Carl's comic foil), an eight-year-old Wilderness Explorer scout set on earning a badge for assisting the elderly, who happens to be on Carl's porch right when the house takes off. Together they embark on an eventful journey that brings them face to face with unlikely travel companions - both friends and foes in the form of talking dogs, an enormous squawking bird and the reclusive Muntz himself - as they arrive in Paradise Falls. By the end of their escapade, they not only become thick friends, but also learn an invaluable lesson about what really matters most in life; a lesson that imbues Up with a strongly beating heart. Pixar once again outdoes itself with Up, a vibrantly bubbly exploration of how life's great adventures can stem from death's gloomy depths. From a distance, Up may seem to be an old-fashioned adventure story, but filmmakers Pete Docter and Bob Peterson utilize the off-the-wall premise to consistently enthralling effect. The chemistry between Carl and Russell plays a pivotal role here, with the pair's various misadventures heightened by the flamboyant supporting characters and breathtaking visuals. Never has the sight of a thousand balloons looked as glorious as it does here, while the mountains, canyons, and dense forests of its South America bristles with life.Up is so human and relatable that it feels like it's more than just a mere animation - it has more heart and soul in its tiniest pixel than most live-action movies can boast in their entirety. No matter how you look at it, through the innocent eyes of a child or the wider, wiser world-view of an adult, the bright, buoyant 'Up' brims with imagination, adventure, humor and heart. You'll laugh, you'll cry, but you won't fail to be lifted!","

"SPIRITED AWAY","petarmatic","27 February 2014","Not only is this the second greatest Pixar film aside from Toy Story, but its the most emotional. I was in tears on so many scenes that I had so much crust in my eye the next day. The music score is irresistible, the animation is unbelievably smooth, and the characters are hilarious. The plot itself is also quite clever. Carl Fredrickson is a 78-year-old man who sets out on a quest with an annoying little boy scout named Russell to Paradise Falls in South America, the place of he and his deceased wife's dreams, until they encounter a giant but extremely rare animal hunted down by a famous hunter, which causes problems. Although plot may seem to be falling at times, it kicks itself right back up, with clever scenes, following the ridiculous occurrences. It all fits well as can be. Similar to other Pixars, with more emotionality. Absolutely fantastic! The perfect film for kids and adults.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","cwfultz","26 June 2003","The best cinematic thing the Walt Disney Company has done in the past half century is tie in with Pixar, a group of brilliant animation filmmakers founded by John Lasseter who left Disney for Lucasfilm in the early eighties and Ed Catmull who was made the head the new company's digital imaging at that time under new corporate head, Steve Jobs. We all know of their extraordinary success. The films appear to just get better as the years roll by and fine writers are located and brought aboard.UP is a quality peer of the best animated feature films ever made. However, somewhat unlike the first two Disney animated features, Snow White and Pinocchio. These two are as yet to be surpassed in enduring contentwhat the great director, Frank Capra, once told me, ""Something to put in their pocket and take home with them."" It's what I call spiritual content, that is, subtext that speaks to the soul.Thus, unlike the first two classics made under the auspices of Walt Disney himself, however, UP is a bit light in its spiritual core and heavier on action and storytwo good attributes of all Pixar features, and in this case with strong sentiment and heartwarming scenes. However, this lack in formula always shortens the legs of all features, live action included.Another fuzz-ball in the lens is the contemporary use of well known voices such as Ed Asner, who does a commendable job as the lead character in UP, Carl Fredricksen, but whose voice clearly kicks off real life images from the brain's memory bank which then conflict with the animated character's image on screen.In 1978 while researching my first place national book festival prizewinner, The World of Animation, at the Walt Disney Company in Burbank, I interviewed several people that had worked with Disney in the mid to late 1930s and was also associated for some years with Shamus Culhane who worked on both of the first two Disney animated features. As a brief sidebar, Jimmy (Shamus)Culhane's name was left out of the of Pinocchio credits because he quit Disney before that film was released in order to help (and in addition for an erroneous health assumption) the Fleischer brothers in Miami on their first two animated featurestwo films not so successful due to poor scripting but both features that had charm: Gulliver's Travels and Hoppity Goes to Town.As for Shamus, most of the scene where Pinocchio sets out to school with an apple for the teacher and meets the fox and cat was animated primarily by Shamus.Shamus and others who were there at the time of Snow White's production confirmed that the reason that Walt Disney used Adriana Casellotti's singing voice, totally unknown, instead of Deanna Durbin's or Judy Garland's in Snow White, for example, was primarily because of the image conflict that does occur with audiences when they hear a very well known voice speaking for an animated character with which we are trying to identify. Today nearly all (but not all) American animation studios use celebrity voices in contrast to the very early years. They also pay top dollar for these voices, a completely unnecessary budget expense.All that said, UP is a wonderful animated film and not just for children, another idea that Walt Disney had that has often been forgottenthat animation is not just for children. The feature animation from other nations bears this out.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Nearly_Headless_J","21 February 2008","...is the first thing I thought when reading the synopsis for Up. An old man borrowed with life attaches hundreds of weather balloons to his house to fly to South America. Along the way he meets up with a young boy scout, a giant colorful bird and a talking dog.Seriously if I hadn't heard this movie wasn't being done Pixar I would have brushed off the movie completely, thinking it nothing more then a stupid, childish animated movie with one too many fart jokes. Even after hearing that Pixar was attached to this film, I still thought the movie would failed.....oh boy was I wrong.Up is a masterpiece plain and simple. It's takes a crazy premise and makes it deep, confronting and oddly relatable. Makes otherwise annoying and one dimensional characters deep. And makes the audience look on in awe one minute, laugh out loud the next and then cry their eyes out finally.There certainly is something to be said about a movie which can make you blubber like a little girl 10mins in only to do it again in the last 20mins. Hopefully I've said enough.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Movie_Muse_Reviews","27 April 2008","I'll be honest. I was prepared to be disappointed when I went in to see this film. As I said in my review for ""Wall-E"" last year (which is at this link if you want to read it: ""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/usercomments-293""), Pixar is the only 3D animation studio that has not made a bad or even mediocre film yet. I was a bit skeptical about ""Up"" not because of the recent news that Disney is worrying about its commercial appeal, not because of the unrealistic plot elements (and there are some), but because after nine great movies, a misfire could be on the horizon. Fortunately, ""Up"" is far from a misfire. Like the other Pixar movies, it takes an intriguing, original plot line and creates a masterpiece of a story with humor and heart.The main character of this story is someone who has the least potential to be made into an action figure, which is probably what is making Disney stockholders nervous as of the date this review is being written. Carl Frederickson is reminiscent of Peter ""Ralphie"" Billingsley (from ""A Christmas Story"" [1983]) as a child, and a cross between James Whitmore and Mr. Magoo as an elderly man. Although his image won't send kids flocking to toy stores, it doesn't really matter. Some great movies have been made with senior citizens as the main characters (""Cocoon"" [1985] and ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" [2002] come particularly to mind), and it's about time Disney make one.The most appealing thing about Carl Frederickson is his character. From the moment he appears on screen, audiences immediately get a sense of his happy times and times of loneliness through a clever series of montages in the beginning. There were probably many old men in Hollywood who could have supplied his voice, but Ed Asner was perhaps the best choice. Asner gives Frederickson a voice that is curmudgeonly without being too off-putting, similar to his Lou Grant character from 1970's TV.In the first 20 minutes of the movie, you grow such an attachment to Mr. Frederickson that you can't help but feel like cheering when his house takes off with the help of balloons he spent all night blowing up. Therein lies the point of the movie where you really have to suspend disbelief. Of course this number of balloons can't pick up an entire house, let alone be blown up in one night without really careful planning. And if you spend too much time wondering how the floor of the house didn't stay on the ground, along with the pictures and other breakable assets in the dwelling, you will miss the point of the movie, not to mention the fun of it. The house is really a symbol of seeking new adventures while hanging on to where you came from all along, at least at first.The basic premise expands with the addition of Wilderness Explorer (or Boy Scout, minus the legal ramifications) Russell, arguably the Donkey to Mr. Frederickson's Shrek (sorry, Disney, but it's true). Russell is a very funny character, and doesn't miss a beat from the moment he comes on screen reading his Explorer book verbatim. The two main characters played off each other very well with witty dialogue and precise comic timing. Take away the comic relief of the talking dogs, and the down-to-the-hair strand awesome CGI animation, and you'd still have a great film with these two characters alone. The Russell character simultaneously adds a lot of well-needed heart to the film, actually making even me feel bad for the potential extinction of the otherwise annoying bird companion Kevin.In an emerging subplot, Kevin the bird is hunted down by a Charles Lindbergh/Howard Hughes-inspired adventurer named Charles Muntz, voiced with the right touch of menace by Christopher Plummer. The Muntz character is perhaps the first Disney villain who you don't want to be a villain, especially after seeing the faux newsreel clips in the beginning of the movie. He's a self-made man who's spent his life chasing a dream, sort of like Mr. Frederickson is by dragging his house to South America. He's also killing a bird that many, including Frederickson, finds annoying. However, if it hadn't been for the perfect moral balance between him and Russell, it would have been very hard to root for Mr. Frederickson until the end.The movie, on the whole, is probably more over-the-top than any other Pixar film made to date. You know many kids in America have a toy collection as diverse as the ones Andy has in ""Toy Story"", and that humans could create a smart robot like ""Wall-E"" someday. But anyone who spends their time wondering how Mr. Frederickson planned to survive after moving his house to the South American clip, or how the hose he's pulling doesn't break off the house, is missing a great fantasy adventure with many awe-inspiring takes on life. To paraphrase the theme song to ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"": ""If you're wondering how he eats and breathes, and other science facts, repeat to yourself 'It's just a show, and I should really just relax'."" On a personal note, having just lost a grandparent who, in the last years of her life, refused to go to a nursing home because she loved the house she had lived in for nearly 40 years, I'm sure the setup of the story will strike familiar tones with many older audience members. I know it did with me, which is why the film was so touching and heartfelt from beginning to end. Hey, I may even be in that situation one day where I love a house so much I would even consider flying it away. If I actually considered doing it, I would hope that 50 years from now they would have more advanced flying equipment to do it with.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Leparsdon","14 July 2003","Up, released in 2009, is a cinematic masterpiece that manages to be both heartwarming and heart-wrenching. Directed by Pete Docter and produced by Pixar Animation Studios, the movie is a poignant exploration of life, love, and adventure. The animation is stunning, and the characters are memorable, making Up one of Pixar's greatest achievements.The story of Up follows Carl Fredricksen, a grumpy old man who embarks on a journey to South America in his house, which is lifted by thousands of balloons. Along the way, he meets a young boy named Russell and a colorful cast of characters, and they have a series of thrilling and emotional adventures. The film explores themes of grief, friendship, and the importance of living life to the fullest, and it does so with humor and heart.The animation in Up is breathtaking, and it captures the beauty and wonder of the natural world. The film's opening sequence, which depicts Carl's life with his wife Ellie, is a masterclass in visual storytelling, and it sets the tone for the rest of the film. The character design is also exceptional, with Carl and Russell each having unique and memorable features.The music in Up is another standout aspect of the film. The score, composed by Michael Giacchino, is beautiful and moving, and the use of music in the film is both subtle and powerful. The film's signature piece, ""Married Life,"" is a hauntingly beautiful composition that perfectly captures the emotional resonance of the story.The voice acting in Up is superb. Ed Asner brings Carl to life with his gruff and lovable performance, and Jordan Nagai is excellent as Russell, a plucky and endearing young boy. The supporting cast is also exceptional, with standout performances from Christopher Plummer as Charles Muntz and Bob Peterson as Dug the dog.One of the most impressive aspects of Up is its emotional depth. The film explores complex themes of loss, regret, and the importance of human connection, and it does so with sensitivity and nuance. The movie's emotional impact is powerful, and it will leave you moved and inspired.The attention to detail in Up is remarkable. The film's sound design is exceptional, and every sound effect is carefully chosen and executed. The movie's use of color is also noteworthy, as it creates a rich and immersive world that is both beautiful and terrifying.Up is a film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. It celebrates the joys of life while acknowledging the pain and loss that come with it. The movie is a cinematic triumph that will leave you awestruck and inspired.In conclusion, Up is a masterpiece that deserves all the praise it has received. The animation, story, voice acting, music, and attention to detail are all exceptional, and they come together to create a film that is unforgettable. Up is a must-see for anyone who appreciates great storytelling and animation, and it is a testament to the power of cinema to inspire and move us.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","randyhndrsn","16 January 2006","Carl Fredricksen (Asner) sets out to Paradise Falls to fulfil his life long dream by tying thousands of balloons to his house, but is unaware of Russell (Nagai) on his porch.The only way is up for Pixar. We say it year after year but there is simply no stopping the mighty animators from producing yet another masterful picture.Last year Wall-E brought about their biggest ever gamble by reducing the dialogue to a minimum and telling the story through physical humour and scene settings with enough semiotics to appreciate the earth's decline.And now there is Up. The first 3D picture to open Cannes film festival went down a treat with critiques and fans alike and now in cinemas across the world smashing records once more, they really have soared.I must confess, seeing the trailer I was slightly apprehensive and concluded this was it, this was where Pixar would go down. Carl seemed grouchy, the puns used appeared ordinary and the plot seemed exceptionally thin. I hold my head down in shame for judging this on its trailer.What we have here is yet another wondrous ambition of life that will break the heart, make the kids laugh and make you feel ultimately rewarded.The opening sequence of Carl in the cinema as a young lad watching his hero on screen sets the tone for the film's central dream concept as Carl meets a fellow youth and the pair share the same adventurous spirit. After an hilarious fall and a sweet how you doing moment the film dives into a silent montage of their life together and when Carl hits a stopping point his life falls apart and until he has no choice, does the house start to fly and the adventure well and truly begins.When watching a Pixar or a Disney picture you have to bear in mind the realism of situations. The unlikeliest is high but this is meant for entertainment and it certainly delivers it. The physical science of whether the house can fly based on helium balloons is open to the guys in the labs but this is an imaginative attempt to portray childhood ambition and it succeeds through this.From talking dogs to an undiscovered bird this has adventure written all over and the fun never stops once the house is up. Russell provides that childhood innocence and ambition to give Carl food for thought and with flying dogs, an explorer with a deadly secret and charming dialogue this spells happiness for the entire family.As more and more animations are now made with 3D in mind this picture was evidently more focused on the plot. Impressive but there are exceptionally few moments with actions coming out at you, like in Coraline or Monsters vs Aliens.Irrelevant in my opinion as we have here the best animated picture this year with a charming plot with humorous characters and marvellous ambition.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","sibelian","21 September 2006","I'm a big fan of pixar movies, I think finding nemo, ratatouille and Wall-E (though to be fair I didn't like Wall-e either the first time I saw it) are some of the best examples of narrative storytelling in the last 20 years. Simply put, the Pixar clan know how to tell stories.That's why I was so surprised when I saw up. Now, maybe my expectations are too high, but I found it to be one of the weaker Pixar efforts. And here's a few reasons why.1. It draws on associated emotion, not real emotion. Much of the sadness in the film (and this is a sad - not happy movie) isn't earned. It comes from referencing other films and our own associations - specifically at the beginning. The opening montage goes by so quickly, as a scrap book, that it falls upon cliché to create the emotion. Granted, for many people this will work, because to be honest, there's something affecting about seeing cartoons go through ""serious"" emotions. Yet, these scenes lack the depth of having our characters go through real actions and real feelings. Things happen, the characters don't do anything - they let things happen to them. (and example is that Russel's (spoiler) parents are divorced. This scene is handled in a clichéd and associated way. So and so's not my mom! Heard that one before...) If you enjoyed the opening montage, watch Mr. Holland's opus - that movie does this same thing better.2. This movie isn't funny. All of the best jokes are used in the trailers/commercials. Much of the comedy is played too subtly (not subtle, but too subtle) and passed over too quickly. There's never a clear moment of what the movie is trying to make us feel at any given time - which brings me to 3. Tone. Is this a comedy, is it a melodrama? The movie doesn't really know what it is or is trying to say. It's inconsistencies constantly set up a new series of expectations which are never followed through on. It's serious...I'm thinking it's going to ... oh wait, a joke...wait...4. The narrative. The movie takes about 2 acts to find itself as a movie. Carl meanders though the film trying to take his South America. He wants to put his house down, and every 2 minutes a new complication arrives. Then, in the third act, he battles the old and now evil (how old is this guy supposed to be if Carl is 78?) Charles Muntz. He comes to defend russel and dug, and the bird. He finds a purpose - the movie finds itself as a movie! Finally...but by then we've spent 2 acts trying to get into another story completely.4A. there are a lot of clever storytelling devices, there is a good story here. It's a matter of the storytelling and dramatic devices the filmmakers use to elucidate that the story that are weak.5. The characters. Between Carl and Russel (shout out to the Asian community) we have a weak set of characters. The most interesting character, Ellie, dies. Her passive husband is left - the into to him shows how awesome she is. What did she see in him anyway? what did he do? Russel is kind of an idiot spaz. why should I root for someone who's so incompetent? If Pixar can animate characters with big heads and big eyes, everyone will think it's cute. Great date movies, great for kids, and hipsters. The overall storytelling I felt was pretty weak in UP. It felt like it was rushed off without knowing precisely where it was going - which is a joy to watch in the other pixar movies. Brad Bird and Andrew Stanton make you feel like you're in the hands of a master who is taking good care you - who is guiding you and surprising you, but never doing something you're not enjoying. Up is very muddled film-making. It's not horrible, but it's much weaker than the other films.cheers.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","robhan","19 July 2006","I don't know, Up is very, very good, but I don't think it's quite great. Of all the Pixar movies up to and including Toy Story 3, I'd say the only movies I like less than Up are A Bug's Life and Cars (the latter of which is easily the worst). But the third worst movie of Pixar's first 15 years is still a very good movie, which I think really speaks to how great their initial run of movies was.I think what holds it back a little for me is that I don't find it as emotional or moving as most people. I can appreciate the opening is sad, but it's never really moved me or made me personally sad, which is strange, because the tearjerker Pixar scenes usually get to me (like the Jessie flashback in Toy Story 2, the opening of Finding Nemo, and all the stuff intended to be sad in Inside Out). Other minor flaws? I think the villain is a bit weak. He has little to no redeeming or understandable qualities, beyond ""he's crazy because he's been stuck in the jungle for 60 years."" The way he comes across as okay and then reveals himself to be villainous like three minutes later just feels so awkward to me. Also, while I appreciate the music and the way that main theme changes throughout, I don't really like the theme to start with. I find it kind of grating, even if it technically and thematically works.Where this movie does shine is in the animation, the humour, and the bond that forms between the two main characters. All the stuff with the dogs is great, too- I know that's the part of the movie that's most obviously aimed at the kids in the audience, but it's still the part of the movie I love the most.The story is told well, and the voice acting is all good too. I just don't find it as moving as most Pixar films, I think the villain is a bit weak, and I think it has one of my least favourite music scores of any Pixar movie. But it's still good- it's solid and entertaining, just not quite great, in my opinion.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","diac228","1 May 2006","A friend warned me that I would feel disappointed by ""Up"". He said it just wasn't as clever and complex as Ratatouille or Wall-E or other past Pixar offerings.But another friend saw it, and recommended it, so I behooved myself to check it out.I agree with my first friend that ""Up"" is a narratively relatively modest undertaking. But I also feel that what it does achieve is notable.It's taken a while for certain aspects to come to the fore in my mind. However, I did immediately notice one honest and useful moral: For all his exertions, Fredricksen doesn't get to really have an adventure until he lets go of a frozen, romanticized version of ""adventure"" that got stuck in his character makeup at an early age. I thought it was great how the story sets this up and creates the situation where he has this breakthrough. Very nicely done.And then there were other interesting things the film achieves. The pacing of the story is odd. In a way, it's hard to say whether this reflects daring or ineptitude on the parts of the folks responsible for the shepherding the narrative. But, in the end, I have to say there was something grand about the way the story rolls along slowly and yet also with a lot of strength. It's as though it aspires to be operatic; with an emotional depth that tries to match the breadth of the spaces and times involved. Sort of like ""Waiting for Godot"" meets ""Dennis the Menace""! I should mention that, about halfway through the film, the pace gets picked up, and stays ""up"" for a long time; a bit ""too much"", in my book, and quite likely a nod to the kid customers in the audience.And then there's that whole side story of Fredricksen's deceased wife (no spoiler there; you see this coming from a mile off). Very nicely done.With the proviso that, indeed, you will see something a bit different from prior Pixel work--no harm in variety!--I can recommend this movie.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","bobbie-16","8 May 2007","Pixar, who never seems to make a wrong step, steps right again! And this film shows no sign of a studio exhausted for ideas. This is one of their best films in fact. What I love about Pixar is their attention to detail, story, and treating their characters with respect. They make complex stories feel simple and effortless by the mastery with which they tell them. And on top of that, they dazzle the eyes and are just plain fun as all get out. When listening to how they developed the story for UP from the director's commentary on the DVD, I felt as if I as an audience member was being treated with respect and even being nurtured and cared for. They took great pains to bring something to life that would touch my soul and enchant me. Yes, UP has a few dark moments, but the undercurrent is sweet and hopeful, making the experience delightful through teary eyes. It is a must see. One note of caution: because of the maturity of some of the subject matter, I would not recommend it for little little kids. Perhaps 5 and above would be a good start. I feel the ""married life"" scene while easily the best moment of the film would be too emotionally hard for them.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","killbillroxxorz","24 May 2005","Another enjoyable Pixar production right here, this time doing for the elderly what ""Toy Story"" did for infants. It does fall a bit too obviously into the formulaic last half hour big chase with the bad guy, which in this particular feature I think was going along perfectly well as it was. Maybe that's just the adult in me, so I'll chalk up the first half of the film for me and the second half for the kiddies.I particularly liked the prologue in which we get the potted life story of Carl and Ellie, the film subtly making the point that life goes on even when you're old and widowed. I might argue that the feisty Ellie character actually seemed to have more going for her than her more passive husband and that I missed her in the second half. I also didn't appreciate the fact that it was their childhood hero and inspiration who turned out to be the baddie and of course cuteness must have its place in any Disney feature and here we get a double dose with Doug the dog and Kevin the err...big bird.However the crotchety old Carl Fredricksen is a fine creation and even more so his keen-as-mustard adventure scout assistant, Russell, the film also reminding us that the generation gap needn't be so wide. While there are fun moments and good laughs to be had, I was most taken with the marvellous animation, as so often is the case with Pixar. In particular the scene of the first ascent of the house with its multicoloured balloons sending it skywards is a visual treat (it's a pity they give this away in the promotional material) as are the first, rainbow-tinged views of Adventure Falls. The vocal characterisations are excellent, with Ed Asner as frosty old coot Carl and young Jordan Nagai as young whippersnapper Russell while the background music is likewise enjoyable and apt.In summary then, another Pixar treat, although like I said from a purely selfish point of view, I do wish they would abandon the routine mini-Indiana Jones big finish, no matter how flashy and superficially thrilling it might be.","

It starts off very sad as you see the main character and his wife throughout the years and the hardships they have endured. The main character ends up loosing his wife and stays at home all day refusing to let people take his home until he injures a man who breaks his mailbox he made with his wife. As a result he is going to be sent to a nursing home but before they take him he unleashes balloons attached to his house, which lifts up his house off the ground so he can go to South America which him and his wife always wanted to do. Unbeknownst to him, a little boy was under the house at the time, who needs to get his badge for helping the elderly. The boy is funny and brings most of the humour to the movie but it's really about friendships and doing things you love. The annoying things I found were the talking dogs. It was funny with the dog they meet but having so many was just annoying.","

Surely they don't profit as much as their rival Dreamworks, but Pixar's films have lasting appeal that can and will span decades and generations to come. I severely doubt a century from now we'll remember Shrek or Madagascar the same way. Pixar's strategy has always been top provide tugs at the heartstrings for every time they deliver a laugh. This mix of comedy and drama has served them well in the past, with Finding Nemo and the Toy Story films being the absolute best examples. Up on the other hand, has overwhelmingly more drama and sad moments than laughs. If you can survive this little shift of film-making from Pixar, then you are in for a treat. Up is yet another grand film from the company that seems to do no wrong and it has great appeal for moviegoers of all-ages.Up is about Carl Fredrickson, a retired bitter old man whom is still reeling from the loss of his wife. Since children, they had a dream about going to Paradise Falls, a secluded location in South America. In her honor, Carl heads out on a quest to South America using his house, and thousands of balloons. Accidentally accompanying him is Russell, a trusty boy scout. Along the way, they'll meet all sorts of characters and more adventure than they could have ever imagined. Written by Bob Peterson (Responsible for Finding Nemo, need I say more?), the film explores themes of loneliness, letting go, life and friendship. The script excels with plenty of adventure, funny moments, and sentimental moments that will make you sniffle a bit.Forget 3-D. It's a stupid trend that will soon go away. The movie looks absolutely beautiful in 2-D and does not need any special effects for it to be appreciated. The people and animals themselves are composed of different shapes, representing their personality. Unlike in other non-Pixar efforts, realism (in terms of people) wasn't attempted, instead focus was on detail. The movie is amazingly detailed, but the production didn't demand as much complicated animation like in Wall-E and Ratatouille. Nonetheless, the film looks great, and yet again proves that Pixar is on top of the animation heap.The main strength of Up lies in the action and its characters. The film has plenty of exciting and perilous moments that keep you guessing how it's going to end. And then, there are the hilarious characters. Carl himself is likable, but doesn't provide as many laughs as Russell, and the eventual animals that are involved in their quest (especially the hilarious dog Dug with the special collar). Up falls more into the category of The Incredibles rather than Wall-E or Ratatouille because of its immense amount of peril. There's nothing wrong with that, just telling you it's not the Pixar fare you've seen in recent years.Like previously stated though, Up is a very tough pill to swallow in terms of its dramedy. The first ten minutes of Up are among the most heart-wrenching in recent memory, and towards the climax we have another moment in which you can't help but feel that lump in your throat. This sort of heavy sentiment has not been present in any non-Pixar animated film this decade, not even Shrek. It is hard to make a cranky selfish old man likable or sympathetic, but like in Finding Nemo with Marlin, knowing the past definitely clears all confusion and answers all the questions we would ask about their challenging personality.Bottom Line: Pixar strikes gold yet again, and in the form of a very creative story about an old man searching for adventure. All the elements that worked in all the Pixar films of the past are present here, and associated with a superb musical score by Michael Giacchino. The only reason you wouldn't like this film is if you don't like Pixar at all---in which afterwards it will be followed by questions concerning your taste in film. Ranking this film, I'd place it somewhere between The Incredibles and the original Toy Story as one of the 5 best they've ever released. How do they do it? It has to be steroids, there's no other explanation.When you're with Pixar, the quality of film has nowhere to go but Up.Highly recommend.","

PIXAR have gone down the more emotional route which is interesting as it will widen the target audience as it is slightly more mature but it really helps with our understanding the character of grumpy Carl. We understand what he has been through and truly empathise with him. There is great character development and PIXAR have managed to create substantial, likable and funny characters. Such as Russel the cute, chubby, quirky kid who tags along with Carl for the adventure of a lifetime. There is Kevin the bird who simply steals the show, Kevin is really funny and very likable (Kevin is so cool) Doug the dog is genius, PIXAR managed to capture the characteristics of a dog in his voice and Carl goes on a character journey along with the audience. It rightly won an Oscar a sit is truly a wonderful animation to be loved by all.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","0rganism","18 January 2004","Carl Fredericksen is an elderly widower whose house is in the middle of a building site. Rather than be evicted to the local old folks home, he ties thousands of balloons to his house and literally flies away to South America for an adventure. However, unbeknown to Carl, he has a well-intentioned stowaway on board This is Pixar's tenth movie in, and the quality of their work is quite simply outstanding. Up is a wonderfully original story about an irascible old man, a likable fat boy, a talking dog and an embittered adventurer from a bygone age. It's a crazy, almost farcical plot, but yet the characters are so carefully observed and real seeming that you are swept along by the beauty of it. The wordless montage of Carl and Ellie's marriage at the start is an extraordinary five minutes of animation. Russell, the Boy Scout do-gooder, is a genuinely great kid - he's goofy, a little sad and he keeps the story moving nicely. The Lost World environs - lush groves, rocky tepui plateaus and dazzling waterfalls - are all rendered with exquisite detail. Although the story takes some swallowing, nothing about the movie seems forced - Carl's growing fondness for Russell, his reluctance to let go of his past life, his resolve to help rescue the rare bird - all flow as smooth as silk. Most importantly, it's hilarious throughout, with comic scrapes aplenty, crazy situations, lots of madcap moments (""Squirrel !"") and genuinely funny characters. The small voice cast are great; eighty-year-old Asner and eight-year-old Nagai make a lovely team, and co-director Peterson steals the movie as both Dug the heroic Golden Retriever and Alpha the scary Doberman. Deftly scripted by Docter and Peterson with actor Thomas McCarthy, and featuring a beautiful score by Michael Giacchino which weaves in and out of the action, adding much suspense, humour and pathos. In the Pixar tradition, the movie is preceded by a wonderful short film called Partly Cloudy, directed by Peter Sohn. Do not confuse this with the 1976 Russ Meyer movie of the same name, or you may never recover !","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Kirpianuscus","20 June 2017","The first fifteen minutes of Pixar's Up play like a full-length movie, featuring a reserved amount of dialog and a beautiful collection of clips that show a childhood friendship that amounted into a healthy, lasting relationship that ended in sadness. The relationship was between Carl, a shy young boy who idolizes the explorer Charles F. Muntz, and Ellie, an eclectic young girl who turns an old, rundown home into a headquarters for her club. The two meet out of nowhere one day, spark an immediate, offbeat friendship predicated on their love for exploring new places, get married, and endure decades of happiness before nature takes its course and Ellie passes away. Up details this in a beautiful, unforgettable fifteen minutes, leading to one of the most impacting scenes of animated emotion I have ever seen.Carl (voiced by Edward Asner) is now elderly, living in the aforementioned rundown house that acts as an island in the center of construction in the big city. Suits try to get Carl to sell his home, but he refuses, until seemingly admitting defeat after an incident with one of the workers turns violent. Carl manages to strap thousands of balloons to his home and, utilizing a complex steering system pioneered by his wife for fun when they were kids, manages to lift the house from the ground and sail through the vast, open blue skies. His destination is Paradise Falls, located in Venezuela, an exotic land where him and his wife always believed they'd reside.However, unwanted company accidentally hitches a ride in the form of Russell (Jordan Nagai), a totally harmless little boy scout anxious to obtain his ""helping the elderly badge."" Before taking off in house, Carl instructed Russell out of kindness to capture a beast that has been tearing up his yard, and Russell returns on Carl's front porch to state his success when he is unwillingly taken up, up, and away along with Carl's entire home. The two wind up sticking together on this trip, both getting more than they bargained for when a nearly extinct bird and an unconventional talking dog turn up in their path as well.If there was ever a film to prove even the most hard-hearted that animation can be a wondrous medium that is capable of showing deep emotion, Up is the one. Writers Bob Peterson and Pete Docter (the Monsters, Inc. franchise) have successfully crafted Pixar's most adult script in terms of theme, focusing on the ideas of death, tribute, and closure, but capturing it in such a way that will not bore or miss the mark with young children. It wouldn't be far-fetched in my eyes to call Docter ""John Lasseter Jr.,"" since he possesses ambition akin to Lasseter's early animation days.If anything, this is thanks to the Docter, who utilizes both his directorial efforts with Pixar to create some of their biggest films in terms of visual scope and range. Monsters, Inc. featured an unprecedented amount of visual flair and colorful content. Consider the scene that took place inside the factory of many doors the monsters could use to enter a young child's bedroom. In one shot, when Mike and Sully are desperately holding on to one door, hundreds, if not thousands of doors are shown in just one shot. In several shots in Up, hundreds, if not thousands of multi-colored balloons are shown, which I'm sure posed and animating nightmare for the production team. The film had such a lengthy production history, a list of ""production babies"" - babies born during the making of the film - reaches about thirty or so children.The plot of Up works as a piece of escapism because it seems to be everyone's fantasy at one point or another - the fantasy being the ability to escape life's current issues by abandoning them entirely and having to answer to no one. In an essence, the film is a staple of what all animated film should include: lovable characters, a beautiful sense of adventure, the right amount of emotion leverage, extraordinary action sequences, and adult themes tackled in a digestible (but not condescending) way for young children. The revolutionary aspect of Up comes while watching this, realizing that animation is not just a timekiller for children, but an unbelievable art-form that will no hopefully no longer go shortchanged in discussions concerning cinema.Voiced by: Edward Asner, Jordan Nagai, Bob Peterson, and Christopher Plummer. Directed by: Pete Docter.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","gheremond","18 August 2015","I am now convinced that all these people who loved this movie must be trolls. This film DOES NOT deserve the high rating. I repeat, it DOES NOT deserve the high rating. Before you watch the film, you are presented with a short film called Partly Cloudy. At first it starts off pretty innocent, but then delves into some garbage about how storks bring these awfully cute babies to their parents. And then it goes on to show you that the clouds went on to create these babies. Absolute garbage! Some of us prefer to be upfront, responsible and honest with our children. We would never teach them this! Granted you have to have a suspension of disbelief to reality when watching films, this kind of theological idea is forced on the audience. Worst of all, it was Unnecessary.Now onto the film. The best thing I can say about this film is the graphics were spectacular! It's east to see how much money was invested in the technologies to make this product. Next I'll say that my favorite characters were the talking dogs and the bird! They were INCREDIBLE! In fact, they could have made a stand alone film and it would have done very well. Bob Peterson is an excellent voice talent choice.Now onto the bad. For starters, the content is inappropriate for this film. The first 5 minutes are drama laden, saddening and very, very depressing! Right off the bat, the audience falls in love with Mrs. Fredrickson as a child and onward. For some reason, the script writers don't let this couple achieve their dream of traveling together; every time they save up, they have to spend it on something else. Then they also show Mrs. Fredrickson have a miscarriage. And then later, she dies.Let me remind you that this all happens in the first FIVE minutes of the film! I kept thinking as I watched this film, ""gosh, this is depressing! I feel terrible!"" Disney films are supposed to leave you feeling like a million bucks! Good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people - this is how it should be in the Disney world. Second, unless you are an annoying, chubby eight year old or a rigid old man, you'll have a hard time relating to these characters. By the time something actually happens to either of them, it's hard to care about them. Countless times, I found myself rooting for the other, no human, good characters or the bad guys.You can't get me to like you by feeling sorry for you. And that's what this film does to the main character.I was expecting something like the pixar film, ""Meet the Robinsons,"" but this was NOTHING like that.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","dbborroughs","26 February 2004","When I first saw the trailers for Up, I was skeptical. How interesting can it be to watch an old, cranky man and an impossibly optimistic, chubby kid float around in a house held in the air by balloons? As it turns out, it can be very interesting. The latest film from Pixar, the tenth in their roughly decade-and-a-half history of success, is, in parts, a comedy, an adventure, a buddy movie and a romance. Each genre is blended with the others to create a funny, entertaining and emotional story.One of the first things that helps make Up so compelling is the pitch-perfect voice casting, particularly of the two leads. As the movie's protagonist, Carl Fredrickson, Ed Asner is delightfully gloomy and cantankerous, delivering his lines with just the right balance of sarcasm and sincerity to make the audience genuinely care and root for a character that would be otherwise extremely unlikable. Newcomer Jordan Nagai provides his character, Russell, whose peppiness could easily have been irritating, with energy, enthusiasm and enough feeling to prevent Russell from becoming a caricature. Of course, a brief cameo by Pixar regular and ""lucky charm"" John Ratzenberger, who is the only person to have been part of the cast of all ten Pixar feature films, as a construction worker doesn't hurt. Though he usually has minor parts, it would be very odd to see a Pixar film without him and his very distinctive voice.Even if it had not been available in 3-D, the visuals in Up would still be stunning. Vistas of a jungle and waterfalls act as an almost jaw-dropping backdrop without detracting from the story or characters. The attention to detail is phenomenal. Even though by now, computer-animation is considered the standard, one cannot help but be amazed at how realistic the film looks. Perhaps even more impressive is how Up uses 3-D technology to its advantage but never allows it to overwhelm the plot, relying on it to immerse the audience in the film instead of cheesy, pop-off-the-screen gags. The color palette, alternately bright and more neutral, really adds life to the film. In fact, the animation and visuals are so well-done that it seems as though Up would be just as entertaining if there was no sound at all, only images.But, of course, as great as the technology utilized in Up is, it's the story and characters that really engage the audience in a tender, emotional experience. What has distinguished Pixar movies from other animated films in the past is the way that it focuses on getting across a story worth telling instead of using the story as a vehicle to tell the jokes. Also, from Toy Story to Wall-E and Up, Pixar movies have appealed to both kids and adults. This appears to be the one of the only studios that realizes that animation is just another medium and that it can be used to tell grown-up stories with mature themes as well as tales that please kids. Though it has its share of laughs and jokes that will make people of any age crack up, the themes and messages that Up explores are decidedly serious. Unlike many recent animated films whose messages usually consist of ""Just be yourself"" or some variation on that, Up focuses on death, loss and, ultimately, the importance of moving on and not letting grief keep you from realizing your dreams. In a world of cynicism and restlessness, its plea for people to recognize life as an adventure, that you don't have to travel to far-off places to experience excitement or grandeur, is especially relevant and crucial. Up is about ordinary people that do extraordinary things in equally extraordinary places before realizing that it is often the simple, boring things in life that bring the most joy.The only major flaw is the presence of a villain. Voiced by Christopher Plummer, Charles Muntz has little role to play than to provide an excuse for lengthy (albeit admittedly thrilling) action sequences. He feels unnecessary and in fact hurts the movie by forcing it into the typical villain-trying-to-kill-hero-for-no-real-reason formula. Though Muntz's canine sidekicks are colorful characters and sources of humor throughout, it seems as though the movie would have been better off without a central antagonist and instead used the relationship between the two protagonists as the main conflict. Knowing Pixar, they could have made Up just as entertaining and more innovative if the formula was ditched in favor of a more character-driven story about self-discovery.However, despite that flaw, Up was a thoroughly enjoyable and heartwarming movie with surprisingly likable characters. It had, not surprisingly, incredible animation that was used in support of a simple yet profound story and helped convey timeless messages of letting go and enjoying the ordinary and complex journey that is life.","

Excellent achievement in every way imaginable as Pixar once again outdoes itself with a wondrous cinematic technological achievement. The story is outstanding early and then stays strong in spite of its second act (which prominently includes a paper thin villain who has exiled himself since the 1940s because he is trying to catch a rare animal with a pack of dogs who wear collars which allow their barks to be translated to English) which wavers a bit, but still comes through by the finale.

"SPIRITED AWAY","jordondave-28085","26 September 2023","Toy Story. Finding Nemo. Wall-E. Based on its pedigree, it is not unreasonable to go into a Pixar movie with high expectations. However, Pixar's newest film is a disappointment compared with its past efforts. That being said, a less-than-expected Pixar movie would not be construed to mean that UP is a bad film. It's good, but not great.Carl Fredrickson (Edward Asner) is a fan of the famed explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). His friend and future wife Ellie, is also a fan. Together, they plan to go to Paradise Falls, just like their hero. However, circumstances prevent them from doing so, and after Ellie's death (and the inevitable future of a nursing home), Carl gets his chance. However, he has an unexpected stowaway: a Wilderness Explorer (think Boy Scouts) named Russell (Jordan Nagai).The film works, I guess, but it's plagued by a number of problems. FIrst and foremost, it has some logical deficiencies. The premise of ""Up,"" a senior citizen traveling to South America in his house lifted into the sky via thousands of helium balloons (the size of balloons that one would get at the zoo), requires a sizable suspension of disbelief. I had no problem with that, or with any unbelievable acts associated with it (such as a senior citizen and a boy who couldn't be more than 10 pulling the house by themselves). I did think about them, but I was willing to give the film the benefit of the doubt. However, I was not able to ignore the film's handling of the villain. I couldn't understand why he did anything that he did in the film (I'm treading carefully to avoid giving away anything). The villain acted in ways to service the story. This severely hurts the film because it runs with the idea that didn't work in the first place.More importantly, it fails to really connect with the viewer. Pixar films like ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Toy Story"" worked because they established a connection between the viewer and the characters. ""Up"" tries, but ultimately fails to do so. The film is all about adventure, but except for one scene, the film failed to get that energy flowing through me.At least the voices are good. Edward Asner makes a good Carl Fredrickson. He acts exactly like a cantankerous old man, complete with the cane and arthritis. However, he does grow a heart. Newcomer Jordan Nagai is excellent as Russell. Russell is an energetic young kid, but he has a tendency to talk nonstop. Carl finds him irritating, and the dialogue is hilarious. Christopher Plummer is unrecognizable as Charles Muntz, the famed adventurer, and that's all I'll say. The best vocal work goes to Bob Peterson as Dug, the dog. He's hysterical. If a dog could talk, I'm positive it would sound exactly like Dug.I won't stop you from going to see ""Up."" It's fun, but don't expect another ""Wall-E.""","

"SPIRITED AWAY","I_am_Jacks_Revenge","13 March 2007","Even trailer made me cry when he goes up mountain alone. For a few perilous moments in the middle of ""Up,"" I began to suspect that the folks at Pixar just might be about to register their first major stumble in the studio's hitherto flawless reign as ""king"" of the computer-animated film (a reign which began with ""Toy Story"" all the way back in 1995). But, like the airborne house that floats at the center of the story, the movie eventually righted itself and sailed off smoothly into the wild blue yonder.This generally wistful and enchanting film tells the tale of Carl Fredricksen, a grumpy old man whose beloved wife, Ellie, has recently died, taking their dream - of traveling to South America, to a place called Paradise Falls, and setting up home there - to the grave with her. When Carl is threatened with eviction, he hatches a fantastical scheme of attaching hundreds of helium-filled balloons to the house and flying to South America on sheer wind power alone. This he does, accompanied by an adorable little tyke named Russell, who just happens to be caught under the porch at the moment of liftoff.So far, so good, as ""Up"" captivates us completely with its imagination, its lyricism and its charm, along with its visual homage to such earlier classics as ""The Red Balloon,"" ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Around the World in 80 Days."" There's also a stunning montage sequence which chronicles - without narration or dialogue - the complete married life of the Fredricksens, starting with their wedding and ending in Ellie's eventual death.The trouble for ""Up"" begins to rear its ugly head only after Carl and Russell have arrived at their intended destination. Here they are confronted by a number of strange and exotic creatures, including a hitherto unclassified species of bird and a bunch of dogs who've been given the ability to speak by some sort of shadowy mad scientist who's clearly up to no good in this remote corner of the world. At times, we begin to suspect that once the writers, Bob Petersen and Pete Docter, came up with the idea of launching an old Victorian house into the stratosphere, they never really figured out what to do with it once they got it up there. But the messy mixture of science fiction and jungle melodrama they've come up with is unworthy of all the quality work that has come before it.Yet, what eventually saves ""Up"" from crashing and burning in its second half is the wonderful voice work by Ed Asner, Christopher Plummer and Jordan Nagai, the soaring and sweetly romantic score by Michael Giacchino, and the theme that sometimes our yearning for adventure can make us so myopic that we fail to perceive the ""adventure"" that's happening right in front of our eyes on a day-by-wonderful-day basis (more shades of ""The Wizard of Oz""). These alone are enough to compensate for the occasional narrative misfires, a made-to-order villain, and an overabundance of drooling, snarling pooches that feel strangely out-of-place in a tender and lyrical fable such as this one.The animation and backgrounds aren't quite as rich and compelling as they were in Pixar's previous two ventures, ""Ratatoille"" and ""Wall-E,"" but the less spectacular look actually makes ""Up"" a more contemplative, relaxing work to sit through.","

It's all refreshing. Simple stories. So simple, yet powerful. They create memories... no... they become a part of our memories as we experience them. The animation, the dialogs, the plot twists, the texture and the special effects brings life into each character and reality to the background portrayed. And, as I watched Up, I can imagine the hard-work, dedication and love put into this masterpiece. The movies before Up I keep them under the categories of comedies. But, Up is an exception. First, this movie is a drama, then it is a comedy. Yes, my friends. It is a drama first. Though, Wall-E is cute and moving, Up is emotional. The movie is true to its very soul. This movie actually brought tears. At times it lit up a smile on our faces in a way that is very understandable. Add a bit of action, adventure and humor to this drama and the resultant movie is a true masterpiece. Pixar always manages to surprise and amaze us in a way no animation movie ever could. As you can see that I am not mentioning even one scene from movie, it's because it is not a movie to be explained nor said, but truly a movie to be watched and experienced.Pixar has done it again. The magic still exists. As always, Pixar rules the world of animation. I give it a 10. No questions, asked. The movie deserves it totally...","

"SPIRITED AWAY","spider_webster","5 June 2005","Up follows Carl Fredrickson, an old man who sets out to fulfill a promise he made to his wife as his world is being taken away from him. Right out of the gate, this film lets you know how special, heartfelt, and deep it is and makes you feel many things throughout. It's tearjerking moments are balanced out with colorful characters that relieve the viewer with clever humor, but even they have genuingly touching moments themselves. What Carl's journey represents is his way of dealing with grief and with grief, obsession is something that can easily slip into it and makes you forget what is truly important in life. Up is an incredible animated adventure film that, like others from Pixar's tenure, prove to be more than just for the children and is my favorite Pixar film (and that is saying a lot). Final verdict: 10/10.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","lesleyharris30","14 August 2013","I just want to say that although I thoroughly enjoyed this film in many respects, it is not for children. It isn't as though they may not have fun watching it, as the visual effects are quite stunning, or they might not get a giggle or two from a few scenes, it's just that in order to fully appreciate the film you must have been in love at some point in your life...or at least comprehend love to the fullest extent.I would categorize this movie as a romantic comedy/action thriller for adults had it NOT been an animated film. As you may have heard it is nothing from what you would expect in the commercial previews. However, it is pleasantly unexpected. Had I known a thorough synopsis through the commercials, as some films seem to give everything away in a 30 second preview, I don't think I would have enjoyed the film as much.The movie touched my heart and as one reviewer said ""I began crying in within the first five minutes of the movie, and I'm not much of a crier."" Well, I certainly concur.This is a great movie for lovers, perhaps those going through a tough time in a relationship, or newlyweds. For children, however, they will most likely utter the words that my niece did, ""It's not funny."" If you have children that are easily entertained, patient, and can sit still through nearly any movie, take them along to watch with your significant other, if you can. Otherwise go with your partner, a close friend, or even yourself. I promise you'll be brought to tears, but they'll soon be wiped away as scenes become more comedic.Enjoy!","

"SPIRITED AWAY","bhcpc","11 July 2003","The one thing that has made Pixar Studios so successful in making high quality CGI films is not just the brilliant animation and the love and craftsmanship that go into each effort, it's those wonderful stories.While the kiddies can wallow in the vivid color spectrum, high energy action and such lovable characters as Sully, Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Nemo, Lightning McQueen and Wall-E, among others, their parents can relish the thoughtful and interesting plot lines.And, with the newest Pixar animated film coming out this weekend, both youngsters and elders can re-live the whole process all over again. ""Up"" is a multi-layered action/adventure/comedy/drama that goes for the laughs but slides just as easily into the other genres.And while the studio has grabbed the lion's share of animated movie Oscar awards, many these movies far outshine much of the live action garbage we're given year after year. In fact, in 2008, ""Wall*E"" was my second favorite film of the year, just behind ""The Dark Knight."" In ""Up,"" Carl Fredrikson (voiced by Ed Asner) is a bitter 78-year-old retired balloon salesman who has just lost his adventure loving wife. He lives alone in a small house no one in the neighborhood ever visits.But Carl does have one dream left – to visit Paradise Falls in South America. Of course, he does not have enough cash to accomplish the trip, so he sets about tying thousands of helium balloons to his domicile.On the very day he decides to embark, however, a fatherless Wilderness Explorer, Russell (John Nagai) just happens to be on his front porch. The story then arcs into pure fun and fantasy, but the growing relationship between the lonely senior and the young boy in need of a role model is not ignored.There is a lot of action in this film, but there is an equal amount of heart – and that's what sets it apart and makes it one of the best the studio has produced (and that is saying a whole lot).Especially wonderful is the short opening segment(mostly without audio, just like many parts of ""Wall*E"") which introduces us to Carl and his wife. If this is not a lump-in-your-throat moment, you're probably a heartless android.Now, I haven't even written about Pixar's crystal clear animation and seamless technology. There seems to be a different look and vibe with each film and ""Up"" is no exception. The characters are rather boxy and goofy, but that's fine and fits in well with this story.The scenes beyond the clouds are vivid, amazingly artistic and wondrous. The emotions run from frivolity to fright and back again. it is truly a roller coaster ride of emotion that leaves you tearful one moment and exultant the next.I almost did not want to leave the theater.And, of course, no Pixar picture would be complete without the opening short. In the past, we were introduced to rabbits and magicians, space aliens and gauntly but cute birds. This latest effort is entitled ""Partly Cloudy"" and is one of the best and funniest, so far.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","emptymask","20 February 2005","I roll my eyes every time someone claims the first fifteen minutes of this film are all it has going for it, that after the silent montage it's just a banal kids' film about talking dogs and giant birds. For me, the greatest moments of Up (2009) happen long after the montage, for its power does not come from those five minutes, but from Carl Fredericksen's emotional journey.Carl has lost his wife Ellie, whom he promised to one day take to Paradise Falls in South America. Life got in the way and he was never able to grant this wish during her lifetime. The whole film is about him getting past his guilt and grief, and learning to live again. The image of Carl dragging his floating house by the hose says everything about his inner state. Russell is not only there so the kids will have a character they can closely relate to; he's there to get Carl to come out and live again, to connect with people again. (He's also a lot like the young Ellie in terms of personality, just a touch less hyperactive.) To those who argue Muntz was a needless villain, I must also disagree. Muntz is a mirror image of Carl in that he is a bitter old man unable to let go of the past and live. Like Carl, he is a recluse, but to a much greater degree, and he is so disconnected from humanity that he sees every other person as a threat.Yes, the scene with the dogs flying the fighter planes is silly, but guess what fellas: this is not gritty realism. This is a film where a man can use balloons to make his house fly to South America. Are we really going to loose it over a Star Wars homage that lasts less than five minutes? I feel this was more of a defense than a review and I apologize for not going over the gorgeous and vibrant animation, and the score. But I think this is one of Pixar's most powerful films and it deserves every ounce of praise it gets, no matter what the haters say.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Vartiainen","13 January 2020","Pixar's first venture into 3D is just about everything you would expect of it. Beautiful, gorgeous, colorful, and all that and a story too. A story full of lovable characters, adventure, and a gruff ol' fart. Everybody loves gruff ol' farts, especially those that have hearts.Some stand-outish things: 1) Whoa. Dog character dialog that sounds exactly like how you'd imagine dogs think.2) Whoa. Animated blood. Pixar truly pulls no punches.3) Whoa. One of the saddest cartoon deaths since Mustafa went down in Lion King.4) Whoa. What a tear-inducing ending! 5) Whoa. That scene when he looks through the adventure album again and discovers something new hit ya right in the heart.Make no doubt about it, whether I have kids or not I'm saving all Pixar productions to be watched over and over again. Nobody I think in the history of cinema has had such regular and trustworthy output, especially for movies that are aimed at children.There is one thing. As their animation has gotten more and more detailed, the character's faces have started looking more and more marshmallowy and plastic, devoid of quite the amount of detail put into, for instance, the millions of leaves in the background. This time you get to see Carl's face get all scrubbly and patchy as he doesn't shave for a few days, but the kid still looks like a plastic lollipop. I'm worried that, although they've gotten to an almost unthinkable level of detail in movement and environment, that Pixar isn't much interested in putting more dynamism into the faces, which still move roughly the same way they have for several years now. This type of thing wouldn't even be noticeable if it wasn't for the constantly improving level of all of the rest of their work. That said, like always, this is merely a nit to pick and not something that it ruinous or damaging to the fun and heart-filled Pixar experience. They are still, as far as I'm concerned, reigning kings of quality CG children's animation.--PolarisDiB","

"SPIRITED AWAY","JTurner82","20 March 2005","When a slight misunderstanding threatens to force elderly Carl Fredrickson (Ed Asner) into a retirement home, the wiley old coot decides to go for broke, attaching thousands of balloons to his house and floating off to the jungle wilds of South America. Trouble is, a little kid named Russell (Jordan Nagai) is also along for the ride, which doesn’t quite play out the way Carl intends it to. This Disney/Pixar instaclassic is a lot of fun, especially in 3D, with charming, realistic characters, sweeping vistas, and a straight-arrow message that’s neither muddled nor heavyhanded.Now, you gotta know this upfront: I love 3D animated films. It’s not like the old days, where the makers would try so hard to make the 3D exciting and amazing that they forgot to make a movie behind the effects. What happens nowadays is that the creators write an awesome, fun movie and then toss dollops of 3D effects to accentuate the story, rather than distract from it. (Or, as sometimes would happen, detract from it.) So maybe I was an easy mark, but I thought Up was outstanding. Ed Asner, as the cranky old man who’s lost his zest for life, turns in a pitch-perfect performance that’s both endearing and curmudgeonly. Of course, the animation is so detailed that you can count the hairs on Carl’s chin as the days progress, but the Pixar gang did a great job in showing the various expressions on the faces of the human characters here, something I think they’ve been slow to develop well. (The toys in Toy Story, for example, looked great, but Sid the neighbor kid did not appear to be fully formed.) The story itself is an adventure on the order of Indiana Jones, if Indy were a septuagenarian with the physical prowess of an eggplant. The unlikely duo winds up in South America, all right, but they encounter more than just trees and rocks. Every animated film needs a villain, and here we get the luminous Christopher Plummer as a thought-dead old-time explorer who’s been holed up at the very spot Carl wishes to visit. Plummer does evil pretty well, I think, especially for a Canadian. (They’re kindly, peaceful folk, you see.) Compared with recent 3D movies, I’d put Up a little higher up than Monsters versus Aliens, but not much. The sweet ending, although expected, packs just as strong an emotional punch as it would if you couldn’t see it coming. And certainly the intended audience for this movie won’t care about nuances; the kids in the theater where I saw this raved about it, keeping in awed silence for much of the film - except when Big Fun Wonderful Things were happening, when they erupted with raucous jubilation.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","drqshadow-reviews","11 September 2014","Pixar does it again. I've watched almost every Pixar movie and it seems that despite the potentially least interesting, least commercial subject (an old guy flying away in his balloon-covered house), they just can't go wrong. It's another great film, exquisitely animated and downright beautiful to behold. What makes Pixar films, and ""Up"" in particular, so special? My theory is that beyond the amazing 3d computer graphics, it boils down to likable characterizations and heartwarming humanistic moralistic stories that don't consider their audiences stupid with a dash of good humor and a pinch of wonder added for good measure. Basically, Pixar films like ""Up"" usually have ""heart"" without feeling forced or fake. The life story of the old guy presented at the start was a wondrous touching piece of work accompanied only by beautiful evocative music. Actually the music in ""Up"" is noteworthy for its emotional effectiveness throughout. The story might appear a bit simple in hindsight but it works beautifully and touches on several universal themes and values such as grief, friendship and acceptance. It has its sad dramatic moments but overall it's quite fun, funny and dare I say uplifting. This coming from a guy who's usually allergic to ""feel good"" movies. It even has an underlying romantic background that makes everything more special.Why is it that Pixar movies, ""Up"" being the latest case, often have better acting than most live-action films? Is it because of slightly-exaggerated animated emotions, the top-notch voice-acting or the incredible facial expressions and body language? I do wonder how ""Up"" would keep the interest for younger children. The pace is sometimes intentionally slow (old guy being a bit slower) and it does have quieter introspective moments. Some places might be up over their head but I think the lovable enthusiastic bumbling boy scout and dog would certainly help keep their interest and it's likely they will be fascinated by the graphics and grumpy old guy. I think ""Up"" can appeal equally to adults and children alike and if the high praise from every corner hasn't convinced you yet, it's definitely worth watching and owning eventually. I certainly want to see it again. Grandparents in particular should see this with their grand kids, or even alone if they don't have any, as they might find it inspiring. My only exception to my high recommendation would be for those few who have disliked Pixar movies in the past. ""Up"" probably won't change their mind but then again why not give it a try anyway?

"SPIRITED AWAY","Nephilim-6","1 August 2003","It is a very beautiful animation film where an exciting adventure is set in the sky. The old Mr. Fredricksen has his house floating by hanging from hundreds of balloons and set off to South America after depressed by the loss of his wife.The first sequence that shows his earlier life is moving. From the first meeting with the neighbor tomboy to the marriage life in the house to the time when she is getting weak, we see his entire life with his wife and get totally in his shoes.The main location is the jungle in South America where his wife had dreamed to visit. He happens to have three companions, a boy, a dog, and a snipe. The house also soon ceases to be accommodation and becomes a big floating companion itself, which he calls by his wife's name. The house's colorful balloons are very beautiful as if they show the house's emotion.The mountainous geography is fully exploited for the 3-dimensional cliff-hanger action, which involves physics where they and the house pull each other by a rope. They have to deal with the balance between the buoyancy from the house and their weight. Characters' movement is briskly and comically choreographed. The materials are realistic, one of the best is the dogs' hair.Honestly, I am not really into the story. Mr. Fredricksen's purpose is vague. And I'm not sure if the film really needs that evil villain. But at least I like the companion characters. Among them, the boy Russell has a soft and round body like a rubber ball. And just like his body, his nature is also sensitive and resilient. I can't help hoping he will become happy.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","doomedmac","28 December 2019","Up is by far the best Pixar movie released to date, and one of the best movies of the year. This film has it all, a great story, interesting characters, a good soundtrack, and great visuals. I watched this in 3D but I think it would be just as good without it because what stands out here is the heartwarming story and the relationship between the old and grumpy Carl Fredricksen and the young boy scout Russell. This movie really grabbed me by surprise, I didn't expect it to be so good, especially after watching the trailers. I thought Carl was simply an animated version of Clint Eastwoods character in Gran Torino. But in this film we really feel for the characters, the character development in this film is just brilliant. There is a scene at the beginning of the movie where there is no dialogue but we all understand what is going on and it is one of the most heartwarming scenes. The film also has several funny moments so there is a nice balance. This is probably Pixars most serious film, but at the same time it is extremely funny. You think Carl is finally fulfilling his lifelong dream when he sets on a journey to South America, but at the end you realize he has already lived the adventure of his life. Sometimes we are so caught up with reaching our dreams that we miss the adventure of the moment. Enjoy the ride even though at first you had different goals and dreams! A powerful and touching story which at the same time combines some very funny moments (I loved how they played with the voice of the Doberman). This is one of those rare films that is much better than the trailer makes you expect it to be. I know it is a little early in the year but I expect this film to be nominated for best picture. Yes, it is that good.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","pifas","29 January 2004","Early reviews of Disney/Pixar's Up made some statements that I myself could not believe. The main charge in almost all the reviews was that the audience was crying within the first ten minutes. This seemed impossible to me, that an audience of people could become so emotionally involved in a film within ten minutes as to start crying...I was wrong. The opening to this film is heartbreaking, and possibly one of the saddest scenes to be featured in a film. And they pepper these little scenes throughout. This movie is very emotionally involving, and that's a good thing.Carl Fredrickson (In his old age, voiced by Ed Asner) at one time was a kid with dreams of being an adventurer, visiting strange and exotic lands. As a child, he met Ellie, the girl of his dreams, and he got married to her. They had a life together, tried to have a baby, and as life went on, the explorer dreams went farther and farther away. After Ellie's death, Carl has become a bitter old man. Now 78, all that Carl has left is his house, which construction workers want down. After an accident where Carl injures a man, Carl is forced into an old folks home, but he isn't going. Being a retired balloon salesman, Carl has plenty of balloons left, so he ties his house up and takes off for South America where he and his wife dreamed of going. Unfortunately for him, boy scout wilderness explorer Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) came along for the ride. Adventure and chaos ensues while trying to get his house to the exact spot in South America.This really is an excellent, if not almost perfect picture. The characters have such depth, as is true with most Pixar main characters. Carl is a mean old man, but he is definitely likable, and it's easy to see the motivation behind his anger and bitterness. Russell is another deep character, written to be the comic foil, and to be a cute little kid, and to be the child from a broken home who has problems. These characters contrast so perfectly and have excellent chemistry, and are just well written in themselves.In many ways this is a touching film. Lot's of character development is featured, mainly from Carl, but from others too. Carl is such a tragic hero, and all he wants to do is set his house down where he and his wife dreamed. Carl's wants and needs should click with anybody who has nostalgia and just wants to live their past. He's a broken man, trying to redeem himself, for himself and for the memory of his deceased wife. It's really a sad tale in itself, but with the normal Pixar magic, it's also an uplifting, funny, entertaining film that will definitely be remembered as a classic.Pixar has yet again raised their bar even higher. Up is a beautiful adventure film filled with rich characters, great animation and very real emotion. Possibly Pixar's best picture yet, and that's including the amazing Wall-E. Best picture thus far of 2009! My rating: **** out of ****. 99 mins. PG for some tragic scenes.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Alan-40","27 December 2005","Typical of Pixar's adeptness in conveying stories, the first few minutes of ""Up"" pack more wallop than a whole two-hour tearjerker could, as it charts Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner) and childhood friend Ellie through the decades, from their role-playing days as intrepid travelers to their marriage, and eventually, Ellie's death. Pete Docter's animated tale is an elegant combination of humor and pathos that perfectly captures the rush brought about by adventure, the uplifting quality of friendship, and -- at once a reminder of Disney's ""Bambi"" and Pixar's refusal to compromise its narratives -- the pain of losing someone. It's a profundity that's both delicate and penetrating.78-year old Carl and his wife Ellie had kept a scrapbook of their planned adventures and always dreamed of going to the fictional Paradise Falls in Venezuela, where their childhood hero, the adventurer Muntz (Christopher Plummer), has famously traveled. For some reasons, the expedition doesn't materialize and Ellie soon dies, leaving Carl alone in the house, with the latter about to go to predatory land developers. Inadvertently bringing along the pudgy Wilderness Scout Russell (Jordan Nagai), Carl decides to fulfill Ellie's wish as he ties thousands of balloons to his house and floats to South America.Advertised as Pixar's first foray into 3D, ""Up""'s candy-colored palette and graceful portraits of Carl's house floating in the sky benefit from the additional visual depth, though the increasingly silly travails of Carl and his slapdash tour is filled with buoyant energy that keeps it from resting entirely on the technology's novelty. Centering on the theme of one's continual search for purpose, Carl learns of how holding to the past keeps him from reaching his destination and from setting off to new adventures, a moral that Docter fortunately doesn't overplay, but rather is represented in splendid visual metaphors. It may be too easy to call it an elevation to animation but there's no escaping the fact that, for all its jaunty adventures and affectionate regard to relationship, ""Up"" -- pardon the obvious description -- doesn't let down.","

Then again, Pixar has done well the last two years with ""Ratatouille"" and ""Walle"". For the heck with it, along with some friends, I went to see it last night. The theater was packed, specifically with parents and their little ones. From start to finish, there was hardly any noise in the theater, except for the constant laughter. What I'm saying is, is that ""Up"" delivers.What's nice about ""Up"" is that it is not only great for kids, but also for adults. I've been noticing lately that Pixar has been incorporating mature themes in their films. Without giving too much away about the plot, ""Up"" deals with things that every person encounters, the loss of a loved one, and the sense of helplessness it brings. Heavy subject matter, but it doesn't make the film too mature nor does it make it syrupy. The message the film delivers, the ability to go fulfill a childhood dream and go on an adventure, if even you think you've outgrown it is brilliant. Watching this movie made me feel like a little kid again. Well done. The voice talent is wonderful. I did not recognize many of the cast members' voices, which I think is a good thing, because a big celebrity like Eddie Murphy or Mike Myers can divert from the intended story. The animation isn't corny nor is it over the top like in ""Happy Feet."" Michael Giacchino's score adds a whole new level to the film. It helps propel the story. When the movie hits a sad moment, the music makes you want to cry. When it hits a suspenseful moment, it makes you want to grab onto the edge of your seat. Rarely do I give a perfect, but ""Up"" deserves one from me. Two Thumbs Way Up for Up! It makes you feel sad. Makes you feel exhilarated. Makes the time fly by. It makes you laugha lot.

"SPIRITED AWAY","PCC0921","30 December 2021","There's nothing more beautiful than finding meaning in life. That's what Carl did. It's a great movie and there's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said. However it's not perfect because I felt like I was being slightly manipulated because I couldn't stop crying, knowing that the scenes were designed to touch my heart.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","miguelneto-74936","28 June 2017","Up is another piece of true artistry from Pixar. It's the story of an old man named Carl, who has become a grumpy old man after the death of his wife. When he is threatened with the possibility of being put into a retirement home, Carl attaches hundreds of balloons to his house and the house takes flight into the sky. Carl begins to steer the house towards his and his wife's childhood dream, Paradise Falls in South America, where he plans to live out the rest of his life.Up truly is an excellent piece of film-making; it resonates more so than just about any other film in the Pixar catalogue. Here director Pete Docter has tailored a film that will both make the audience laugh, and cry. Though the film finds its strength in its themes. With this film Pixar has dared to deal with some very heavy themes, such as growing old and one's childhood heroes not always being what we want them to be. The themes are expertly handled by Docter, never feeling heavy-handed, but it is Docter's amazing ability to let the emotion of a scene to play out is what makes this film a true stand out above many other recent animated films. Now this should not fool one into thinking that Up is not a great film for the children as well, because it is.Up is first and foremost an amazing adventure film. It's action packed, filled to the brim with pulse pounding action sequence after another. Another one of Up's strong suits is its comedy. It is quite possibly the funniest film Pixar has ever made, a large part to due with the wonderful cast of characters within this film. You grow to love Carl Frederickson and the rag-tag crew that follows him. Of course what makes Up a film for the ages is its sheer imagination. No other film in recent memory has sweeped me away into its world quite as well as Up has. The film's world is unique, endlessly filled with original idea after original idea. Who would have ever thought of a house flying through the air, or making a 78 year old man the hero of an adventure story? The guys at Pixar did and it paid off big-time.Once it is all said and done Up is one of the finer films of the year, and definitely stands amongst Pixar's best (but is there really a worst). While it is sold as a children's film, many adults may find themselves enjoying this film more than their kids, thanks to its often serious subject matter. Though children will love the films flat-out hilarity and its high octane adventure. Up is a true masterpiece.I give Up a perfect 10 out of 10!","

"SPIRITED AWAY","emasterslake","15 March 2005","When I walked into the theater last night for the 9:15 showing of Up I had high expectations. I didn't go in with a half-hearted interest or mild confidence; I was expecting to see something amazing and I wasn't let down. ""Up"" flies as high as the House that becomes the premise of the film.I admit I was a bit distracted when the movie began; either no one knew the movie was starting or no one cared because they were being VERY loud. But as the movie played on the noise died down and I found myself charmed by an opening sequence that is so emotional that you'd hardly believe you were watching a children's movie. In fact, three fourths of the way through the sequence a younger woman sitting in front of me declared to her friends ""This movie is sad!"" in a voice that indicated she had not been expecting it. That being said this movie is still definitely suitable for little children and although I wouldn't go as far as to call it a children's film (I think pixar is beyond that) it has, as always when it comes to pixar, no course jokes or crude humor.As the movie progressed past the opening sequence, I almost expected to be let down by what came next; I wasn't. After a touching opening sequence that told the tale of his life, the character of Carl Fredrickson continues to be developed with such care that you can't help but feel sorry for him when the men Nursing Home comes to hall him away; even if he is a bit grumpy.Since I don't have time to go through the movie section by section (and you probably wouldn't have time to read it even if I did) I'll continue this review by highlighting my favorite bits and criticizing what little there is to criticize.The scene in which the house is sweeping through the clouds as a storm rages around is truly incredible; the action is actually intense and you don't feel like your watching a happy fairytale in which the characters would never get hurt or die. In general, the action was that way throughout the film. There was one point somewhere between the touching storytelling, the witty script and the epic action that I literally forgot the movie was animated and that has arguably never happened to me before.The biggest downfall of the movie, in my opinion, were the evil talking dogs. I found Dug to be the only talking dog that really came across effectively; the other ""evil"" dogs had little to no character development, were not memorable at all and were not threatening in the slightest. When they climbed into airplanes to shoot at Russell I found myself rolling my eyes in disbelief; dog's flying airplanes? This small downfall, however, is not near enough to ruin the movie in any way.Another slight downfall (and I'm not sure if I'd really call this a downfall) is that I would have liked a bit more of a sense of wonder and discovery when Carl and Russell first arrived at Paradise Falls; perhaps they could have discovered a few interesting creatures (besides Kevin) or strange plants. Ultimately I don't think they would have had time for this which is probably why it wasn't there but it would have been nice addition.As you can probably already tell, my overall opinion on this film is VERY positive; although a bit more of time would have made the film a bit more interesting and well-rounded, in the end, it is not needed and the film still comes across as charming and even epic without it.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","cardsrock","17 March 2020","My wife and I didn't know if we were going to see this Pixar/Disney film because it just didn't look all that interesting to me in the movie trailer... I was wrong! The movie is darker than any other Pixar movie and it has a more adult theme... keep that in mind if you are planning on bringing your children! The villain is VERY bad and the way they ended his character in the movie was not appropriate for children under 10! In fact, my wife and I were wondering why they didn't portray his character having an epiphany and turning back to good.All in all a very good movie, never drags and the story is quite sweet... but don't forget it is dark and mean at times and that could make it difficult for small children!","

What I wasn't expecting was just how funny Up is. There's this tremendous dry wit to it that had gone way over my head the last time I saw it, which was when it came out (and in 3D, mind you) what feels like a billion years years ago. Even though it starts getting into ""half an hour this pensioner could barely move and now he's basically superman"" territory I never felt I minded that much. That opening, those gags, that artistry. It's classical Pixar and it's utterly mesmerising.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","bluzman","26 September 2003","I went into this film amazingly enough knowing absolutely nothing about it except that it was Pixar's newest release, that it was 3D, and of course that it was called UP. I have to say Pixar tops itself again. As a fan of traditional 2D animation, 3D animated films have always been a rough pill to swallow. Even if I really like them I still have a twinge of despair that they are in the 3D medium. I don't want to say that I am completely transformed and now love 3D, but Pixar always does a great job in lessening that pain.I found Up to be a very heartwarming film. We got a glimpse of Pixar trying to play with the heartstrings in Wall-E, but they definitely have some far more emotional moments in Up. But with the great laughs and story included. I found it to be a fantastic ride that will have you almost in tears one minute and then laughing out loud the next. Great story. Great voice actor. And great Animation. Well done Pixar.If anyone could get a stubborn old traditionalist like me to enjoy a 3D film, it's you...","

"SPIRITED AWAY","JohnLennon1985","15 February 2003","The opening sequence is the most powerfully emotional image in a long time; for any genre of movie, let alone an animated family film. It does bring a tear to the eye, and may be too sad and intense for children to take. Taken at its intent to show a once happy man's loneliness as a foundation for the story line that follows or taken as too strong a message will probably determine if you like this movie or not.I did. The central character, Carl, is a very likable guy, and can be sympathized with immediately. The boy scout kid represents what Carl feels he has lost, and the adventure is his effort to reclaim it. There's a great feeling of freedom and escape when the house zooms out to the sky, and an eagerness to see things along with this good man as he embarks on his journey.It's a great ride, both literally and figuratively. The visions of the animators of what the world looks like from this unlikely dirigible is authentic, beautiful, and inspiring. Colors are used vigorously and with astonishing precision. The overall look of the film is simply wonderful. The enormous Grand Canyon like precipices in Carl's South American Shangri La type destination almost appear as a dream scape. One example of the creative imagination in the movie is when the hero carries a giant object along, strapped to his chest--I hope I get to do that one day.As for characters, most are fun although not always essential. The dogs and their human-like gifting is the stuff of great humor. The mythical creature was a nice touch. My only criticism of the movie would be the choice of villain. Someone who should have been a fast friend for Carl since they think the same way is depicted as vengeful, bitter, and vicious. It was too pessimistic a choice; a longer look would have provided a more logical bad guy.In summary, some visions are very strong emotionally, but the final product is another fun and exhilarating triumph for Pixar.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","p-52388-53189","4 April 2020","While I didn't find this nearly as impressive as Ratatouille or Wall-E, Up was still a quality Pixar product, and a creative, if slightly pandering animated film. The animation, as to be expected, was stunning. The character design and ballooning portions of the film were exceptionally crafted. The story, however, was lacking. The first 30 minutes were perfect, exuding a level of maturity I didn't expect from a Pixar film. With minimal dialogue, the expressive cinematography was emotionally effective, reminiscent of the best moments in the nearly silent Wall E. The summation of Carl's life with his wife was absolutely beautiful. It is truly one of Pixar's finest moments, and one of the best scenes of 2009 thus far. Once Carl's journey got underway, however, the film took on a far younger sophistication, with cutesy side-characters and inane slapstick moments thrown in to keep younger audiences awake. Kevin the bird was especially annoying. On the other hand, the dogs were hilarious and creatively crafted, garnering some of the best moments in the film. Overall, I thought UP was an enjoyable, if somewhat underwhelming film that could have been so much more if it didn't noticeably pander to younger audiences. Even so, Pixar's heart is always in the right place.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","pwargo","23 July 2003","I'm sure for the handful of people that read this I'm going to probably get a 0 out of 12 found this review helpful. It seems, almost without exception that positive reviews are deemed helpful but negative ones are not.With that said, I felt this was one of the most disappointing, if not the most disappointing Pixar film yet. The story was obviously pieced together almost as an after thought. It was flawed, and at times preposterous.First, what I liked. The opening 15 minutes. When the young boy and girl met, fell in love, grew old together, and then...well then the rest of the movie happens. Also, very much enjoyed the little boy scout character.Again, a spoiler alert is called for here. In the opening scene, Carl Frederickson, the 78 year old hero of the story, is a little boy watching a newsreel in a movie theater of his hero, an intrepid adventurer who travels the world in his airship (blimp). Jump forward seventy years later and our 78 year old hero runs into his hero, at least thirty years his senior and the hero looks and acts like a man in his late 50s or early 60s. I mean, Please! Then, the dogs. Oh yes, those cutified, electronic collar talking dogs. Are you kidding me? Who came up with that idea? Ugh!!! We know the idea of ""Up"" came from the Japanese masterpiece ""Howl's Moving Castle."" But how that could have a rating on IMDb of 8.1 and ""Up"" a rating of 9.1 just boggles this person's mind.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","FogelNo1","17 October 2002","I remember seeing this movie as a kid in theaters. I was like 8 or 9. I didn't think it was an awful movie, but it (kinda) didn't makes me feel something, I just didn't get the point. Yesterday I buy this movie thinking maybe it was too deep or more for adults. And I was kind of right. I think kids can enjoy this movie, but adults too, and maybe even more than kids. I love all the metaphors (House represents what Ellie is for Carl), the music and the animation (even though I sometimes feel like they didn't nailed the balloons). In general, the first half was like a 4,5/5, truly brilliant. But the second half, I thought didn't gave that brilliance of the first half. It felt so fast, kind of messy and the action didn't worked for me. And the fact that Muntz dies, makes Carl kind of the bad one, like he doesn't care about that death, it doesn't even bothers him. Anyway, that half doesn't makes the movie a bad one. Its an 3,5/5 half. Still deep, great message (I would summarize like this: Love is amazing but you still have to do your own thing. What would you say?) and I don't know much about that stuff, but I think I can say it has a great character arc. Not a brilliant movie, but a veeery good one.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","EdwardtheBlackPrince","8 April 2021","No one company has given me as much movie enjoyment over the last 14 years. No actor, director or studio has me anxiously awaiting even the announcement of the next project as Pixar.Pixar value story over pop culture references and winking at the screen, genuine charm and consistency over simple cuteness and syrup, and establishing character over crass marketing ploys (probably ""Cars"" aside).If you like any Pixar film read no further, there is no letdown here. Go watch Up.It doesn't even matter if you have kids or not, Up is just a great movie. I for one have watched every Pixar release since Toy Story in 95, which was of course the first, and as my son is still too young to go to a cinema I went to Up kid-free. Don't be snobbish adults, you'll miss out on some great flicks.If you are still uncertain here is what Up is about.We open with a star struck little kid, maybe 7? at the ""moving pictures"" in what might be the 40s or 50s, watching a news piece on the rise to prominence, and subsequent fall from grace of explorer Charles Muntz.On the way home, still on a giddy high from his 40s fanboy experience, the boy runs into a similarly aged young girl, also an exploring enthusiast named Ellie. Carl and Eddie are polar opposites, Carl seems quiet, shy and introverted, Ellie is loud, opinionated and outgoing. They grow up, get married and plan ambitious exploring missions.Now comes the most moving dialogue-free few minutes that I have experienced in a film for perhaps ever. A simple slowly paced montage shows Carl and Ellie and how they grow together through life.Realistically this is the kind of step that can only be pulled off by an animated movie, but this few minutes is amazingly effective. In it we learn more than we could have discovered in a totally separate 90 minute film about the same characters.One key point from the montage is that despite their best efforts, Carl and Ellie are never able to save enough for their trips before the funds are needed elsewhere - ultimately Carl is left alone. No sappy last words, no clumsy togetherness, just a lifetime summarized in minutes.10 minutes in, and I'm genuinely sad.Carl is now 70 something, think Clint Eastwood in ""Gran Torino"" without the forced everyone is racist – but that's sometimes OK clumsiness. He lives in the same home that he and Ellie shared, and now it more than anything is the embodiment of his deceased wife and their happy life together. Therefore, while progress is altering all around him he stubbornly refuses to move with the times.One day a knock at the door introduces us to Russell, a Wilderness Explorer (Boy Scout). Russell is looking at adding to his hefty collection of merit badges by helping the elderly.Russell is a typical 10 year old kid – well meaning, book smart about topics a 10 year old should be (animals and such), especially Wilderness Explorers but unaware of how much of real life actually is. He says 10 year old dumb things because he doesn't yet know any better, Russell is just a boy growing up.Carl is a crotchety old man, and when he does change it is only subtle and for legitimate reasons.Back to the film, Carl shoos Russell off with a wild goose (snipe?) chase, and goes back to his lonely existence.After a run in with developers, Carl is told that he has run out of time and must move to a retirement home, and two men show at his door to take him there.Now anyone who has seen even the poster knows what happens next, so there should be no surprise at how he leaves, but when it dies happen it was a spectacular event, both visually and cinematically, and it carried a real sense of something actually happening, not just a plot device.I had all over tingles for minutes. Good ones.As luck would have it Russell has come back to visit and has inadvertently stowed away with Carl on his journey to fulfil Ellie's wish and Carl's promise.Russell appears Asian-American (to be PC), and it is refreshing to see Asian-American animated actors getting more work, as up until now the animated landscape has been dominated by white, black, green and blue characters.Carl and Russell (well really Russell) befriend an 8 foot tall South American bird while ""walking the house"" the final stretch to Paradise Falls and the bird, who Russell names Kevin becomes quite protective of him.Yep I said Walking the House.I'll go spoiler free from here, Up is a film that earns the right to unravel in front of the audience.Once in Paradise Falls they meet more characters, not all human - but still capable of communicating. ""SQUIRREL!"" There is a very effective chase scene, house included, and a finale that makes Carl the most geriatric Indiana Jones type character since, well Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.Being an animated film involving a man floating his house to another continent and his subsequent adventures of course the plot includes ludicrous events and situations, none seem truly out of place. Up remains amazingly entertaining and deserves repeated viewings.One final point, there are a few situations where Carl and Russell and various animals are put in danger, so younger children may be a bit distressed at times (OK parent hat off).Final Rating – 9 / 10. There is nothing more certain than the fact that I will be watching this many times in years to come. Loved it.If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com","

"SPIRITED AWAY","vasco_cid","10 March 2003","Yet again, and why are we still surprised at this?, Pixar has dazzled and amazed all of us who believe that movies have the ability to rise above mediocrity and simple-mindedness no matter what genre. Gradually, these genius computer animators have grown more mature in their writing, bringing alive characters that perhaps kids would like but adults would almost certainly love. It seemingly started with Ratatouille, but these elements were evident even in Finding Nemo or The Incredibles. Here, it all comes together in an incredible array of sparkling animation and vivid storytelling that will show audiences once again that Pixar has a monopoly on animated films.There are sequences done here that no other studio would dare touch, much less for an animated movie (consider the silent sequence depicting Carl and Ellie's life together). But, Pixar is so far above the average and ordinary, they dare to dream and tell the story in a way so different and more effective. Our hero here is Carl Fredrickson, a 78-year old retired balloon salesman who has lost his wife of many years and is feeling the effects of pressure on elderly people by the world. He decides to pay tribute to his wife by attaching thousands of balloons to his house and float away to Paradise Falls, a secret place in South America he and his wife vowed to go to one day. However, things happen, such as an ambitious 8-year old boy scout trying to earn his final badge stows away and they find a giant, exotic bird named Kevin, and a dog that can talk named Dug. The more I think about this story, the more I like it. For my taste, it doesn't reach the magical levels of Wall-E, Ratatouille, or the the original classic Toy Story, but it pulverizes movies made for the pop culture crowd like the Shrek movies, Ice Age, and Monsters vs. Aliens.Perhaps the biggest asset to Pixar is Disney, which gives them a seemingly unlimited amount of resources to create worlds that are wondrous to experience. Every single one of their movies are at the top of computer animation for that time and this is no exception. The color palette which director Pete Docter is working with exceeds all levels of imagination and makes for a glorious adventure. And the characters are likable as well as not likable at some points along the way. A mixture of mirth and fantasy, Up is an adventure like no other. Kids may like it, adults will love it. And as for Pixar, there is only one direction for them to go and that would be... up.","

Nothing stands out to me or really appeals to me in the movie. I don't the characters very interesting or memorable. The story is not played out very well at all. the voice acting is good, but nothing special. There were actually quite a few times the characters only annoyed me. I'm not calling the movie bad, but in no way do I consider it amazing. It's just very average to me, on both an entertainment scale and a cinematic scale. this definitely does not compare to animated classics such as The Lion King or Aladdin. It's definitely suitable for young children, though and they will probably enjoy watching it. So if you're looking for a family film to watch with the kids, this movie is for you.","

Gosh, what originality and what a plodding plot, characters, and empty subsidiary characters!! Yes, you just sit there while old Walt works the sentimentality line he did in the forties and fifties, only with modern animation, eg fat Americans who eat chocolate! Sorry I could not enjoy it more, but you suckered me into the cinema (only £3 each admittedly) and gave me a tired rerun of a lot of other Disney rubbish with superficial modernisms. And please can we really not have that cliché of how the real American Dream of family, apple pie and redemption is just around the block?

"SPIRITED AWAY","mfellipecampos","21 June 2021","I own every Pixar film on DVD but I have to say that UP may be the first one I pass on. I was very excited about seeing the film today after reading several good reviews. I think now that perhaps some reviewers out there are letting the Pixar reputation get to them. I can't believe ANYONE would say this is one of the best films of the year. Films like MONSTERS, INC, FINDING NEMO, WALL-E and TOY STORY deserved accolades like that but UP doesn't have the heart those classics did. The film is at its best early on when the characters aren't talking much. We see a montage of the lead character's life as a young Carl meets an exuberant girl named Ellie. We see them marry, live a life together, experience the highs and lows of life and finally, we see Carl loose his beloved Ellie and become a widower living alone in the house that always was their home. This sequence is moving and made me think that Pixar was about to strike another home run. However, at this point the characters start talking more and the story starts to get a bit...much. Carl decides to tie a bunch of helium balloons to his house in order to fly the house off to South America on the adventure he and Ellie were never able to complete together. He unwillingly takes along a young boy scout stand-in (Russell) who ends up on Carl's porch when the house takes off. Russell is determined to earn the patch for helping the elderly required by his troop in order to graduate to senior status. The balloon premise is a bit far-fetched but since it's an animated film, you go with it. However, once in South America, things get progressively weirder. Carl and Russell end up walking through the jungle and mountains with the house strapped to them, floating above. I think I knew the film was NOT going to be the usual classic I was used to from Pixar when they come across a bunch of talking dogs. It seems Pixar, whose done films about animals who can talk and done films just about humans, wanted to mix the two so they write into the story these dogs with collars that allow us to hear their thoughts. The dogs belong to an old adventurer living in the area who is determined to capture a big, ostrich-like bird to prove he's not the fake the world judge him to be decades ago when he claimed the bird existed. The adventurer has hundreds of dogs and not only do they search the jungles for the elusive bird, they also cook for their master, serve meals AND fly planes. Very weird. I think if you're going to make a film about smart, talking animals - make a film about smart talking animals (FINDING NEMO) and if you're going to do a film about humans, do one like THE INCREDIBLES about humans. In UP Pixar tries to mix the two and it just doesn't work. The ONE character who I thought had the most heart and was most interesting, was Kevin, the big bird who doesn't talk, seems devoted to her young and takes an instant liking to the human boy who probably reminds her of her babies. I heard kids in the audience more than once asking what was going on because they couldn't quite understand the story. I suspect UP will not be one of those films kids will watch over and over again like they do with the other Pixar classics. Pixar has some incredibly talented people but in UP I think they spent too much time on ""cool"" ideas and not as much time on developing the story and characters into something we could care about and believe in.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","neilperera20","10 July 2003","Karl (voiced by Ed Asner) met and married the girl next door, Ellie. Ellie was an extroverted adventurer while Karl was a shy, reserved person but their friendship and marriage lasted a lifetime. It was Ellie's dream to follow in the footsteps of a famous world traveler, Charles (Christopher Plummer) and make her way, someday, to Paradise Falls in Venezuela. Over the years, however, Karl and Ellie, a childless couple had many home and life realities to deal with and they never made it to South America. Now, Ellie has died and Karl is forlorn. Not only that, developers want their Victorian house, the last holdout in an urban neighborhood, to be razed to make way for high rise buildings. They almost get their wish. But, at the last moment, Karl attaches a fleet of balloons to his house, lifting it in the air, and steers a course for Paradise Falls. But, wait, there's more. A talkative, tweenage scout, Russell (Jordan Nagai), who had convinced Karl to help the young lad earn a merit badge for helping the elderly, has stowed away under the house's porch and is, thus, a fellow passenger in Karl's house-airship. At first, Karl is annoyed but after they land in Venezuela, not on target, Russell helps Karl begin to move the household toward the falls. The two also encounter a trained army of dogs, who obey the commands of their long-lost-to-the-world master, Charles the explorer, who has been trying to capture an elusive, large, colorful bird, new to the known world. It seems Karl and Russell are definitely putting a spanner into his plans. What will be the outcome? This is an extremely wonderful family film, highly entertaining and very, very touching. The story is ingenious, with a flowing action that will keep everyone riveted and the animation is amazing, especially in 3-D. But, added to that mix, is a beautifully moving tale of true love, friendship, and loyalty. This viewer was in tears several times and would dare to say most others will do the same. As the voice of Karl, Asner is excellent, his gruffness hiding a caring soul. Nagai is also topnotch, very funny and very sweet as the young, lonely boy. Plummer, too, does a fine job as the ""heavy"" of the movie and the lesser characters are absolutely perfect, too. In fact, this is a rarity among films, in that it is almost totally without any flaws whatsoever. If you can only see ONE film this year, make it this one. It is UP at the top, and will remain so, of the list of films for 2009.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Mr Toad","19 April 2003","For starters, I would like to apologize for the summary description I gave this film (I couldn't resist the chance to use a pun). Now that I've said that, lets cut to the chase; Up is your average Pixar movie...and if you're not familiar enough with Pixar then you should be informed that the average Pixar movie has 1) excellent voice acting. 2)cutting edge animation. 3)great story and script. and 4) heart.In other words, Up is slam dunk of a family movie. The plot is about the misadventures and adventures of an old man named Carl Fredriechson and a tag along boy scout. But there's more! If you want to know the rest, then go see the movie.Like all Pixar movies, the voice cast is spot on. All of Up's characters are brought to life with well read lines, vocally emotional undertones, and an assortment of talents. Pixar's trademark CGI animation also breathes life into the characters, all of them are given convincing facial animations and gestures which could match any Hollywood A-lister's.All of the CGI (which is everything seen in the movie) is done beautifully. The scenery is breathtaking and the jungle sets sometimes look as if they were ripped from an issue of National Geographic. Pixar's signature animation is always cartoonish, yet photo-realistic and of course, ahead of their competition.What's also impressive about Pixar is that they never underestimate the power of story. Up's story is original enough (talking dogs and a house held afloat by balloons aren't even the half of it) but it isn't just about the physical conflict and events. It is really the story of an old man trying to find redemption in the twilight of his life by fulfilling an unrealized dream. Pixar has mastered the art of throwing tragedy and warmth into the same basket without becoming too heavy handed, and you can feel it in this movie. Up is also exciting and fun. The sense of adventure is palpable and the humor is charming. The script is also nicely written and clever. This movie is also very, very family friendly, despite its PG rating.The bottom line is that Up is beautiful, touching, humorous, charming and kid and parent friendly. It is just another grade A Pixar movie. Which means that unless your inner child is completely dead you should see it!","

However, as we grow up and lose, we are also experiencing the sweet and bitter life of life. We are also told by people around us: there will be thorns under the blue sky and white clouds, and there will be all kinds of maliciousness in the smile.
This is the ideal world of utopia that we dare not think about. But in fact, life can be insipid, knowing one person, loving that person, staying with that person, staying together until the death separates the two. What a wonderful thing.
In the film, Carl and Ellie's time is always sweet and indifferent: build a house of love together, go to a picnic together, watch the sun rise and fall, and the ordinary lens is very warm.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","johnnysugar","25 September 2002","I'm not particularly a fan of animated movies, but once settled in I can generally find them entertaining and worthwhile. The same can be said for ""Up"", the tale of an old widower curmudgeon who inadvertently hijacks a stowaway on his sky-bound home as it lifts off for a lifelong destination called Paradise Falls. The film is colorfully rendered, and if you're a guy who once might have been involved in Scouting at any level, you'll get a kick out of Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner) sending his young hitchhiker Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) on a hopeless snipe hunt. When these things occur, I find myself in the underdog's corner, and when Russell finds a snipe and names him Kevin, the adventure really gets under way. It's too bad Carl's childhood hero turned out to be a villain, but that sets up the challenge of saving his new found friends from a diabolical, mad scientist, and find a way to get back home. Oh yeah, can't forget the cute canine pal along for the ride as well. His name is Dug, and is sort of the comedy relief character along with Kevin, and has a big hand (paw?) in making the save for the intrepid travelers. For it's efforts, ""Up"" won a Best Animated Feature Film at the Oscars in 2010 against some worthy contenders. In it's own way, the film has something for young and old alike, and if you're feeling down for any reason at all, you might even find it up-lifting.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","linkguy631","18 June 2005","When Pixar first introduced the concept of purely computer-generated feature films, little did they know that they had created a ravaging ravenous monster that only they – and DreamWorks – would be able to tame. Forgetting that Pixar's philosophy has always been that you should always take time and care when working with this technique and that storyline was absolutely paramount, other companies gave in to the temptation to exploit the revolution and whip up several second-rate CGI flicks that were so enticingly easy and inexpensive to make.Computer animation has almost driven quality children's animation to extinction. It has been the death of cartoons, and the decline of claymation. Though the two aforementioned animation giants have thankfully managed to continue producing such wonderful specimens as 'Toy Story' (1995) and 'Shrek' (2001). The last fourteen years have taught us that only these two companies can manage to get it right, that only they can tame the monster.Now Pixar's offerings did falter after 2004, but they regained their footing last year with Wall-E and have sustained that success with Up, an exhilarating yet also deeply moving film. It tells the story of Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Jeremy Leary at the beginning, but mostly by an amazing Edward Asner) a man who dreamed of adventure as a boy, a passion that saw him meeting and later marrying the sweet Ellie (voiced quite well by Ellie Docter, the director's daughter). The two share a long and beautiful marriage in a cosy little house that the couple decorated together, but after many years Ellie dies in hospital next to a very broken-hearted Carl. Though after her death Carl holds on relentlessly to their house and all of his photos and memories of her, he also goes on to attempt to fulfil her childhood dream which was to have a house in a lost land in South America.The story of his marriage is told quickly and with little dialogue, though still with much grace and emotion. This is of course so the exciting adventure he embarks on – which involves him taking off in a house tied to a million balloons – can be given most of the screen time, as it is more of a crowd-pleaser. Though the winsome themes are not forgone at that point, and more depth and more fun arrive when we are introduced to young ""wilderness explorer"" Russell (voiced perfectly by Jordan Nagai) a naive and extremely animated boy who ends up tagging along to assist the elderly Carl.There is also a villain thrown in – perhaps unnecessarily, though he does give us a fair bit of enjoyment and is a major supplier of the story's complications – with his own story that is first mentioned and begun to be told at the beginning, and waits in the wings until near the end where he reappears and starts being nasty to the two heroes. He is explorer Charles Muntz (voiced splendidly by Christopher Plummer) who surprisingly is Carl's childhood hero, a ruthless tyrant obsessed with hunting down, killing, and taking back the strange bird-like creature that stalks these lands in order to prove he has seen it and has made it to the lost land.Remembering its genre, it is a remarkable achievement and one that reassures us that Pixar is still the best. It even manages to surpass Wall-E, which very visibly tried too hard to incorporate meaningful messages and to be a masterpiece. Although it succeeded, it didn't do so anywhere near as naturally and effortlessly as Up did.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","anti_heroi","3 April 2020","This was the tenth feature created by Walt Disney Pictures studios and Pixar sounded like it had simple concept, but it is done so beautifully that you can feel yourself in the story. Basically, young Carl Fredricksen (Jeremy Leary) loved the idea of exploring, and his hero was the great Charles Muntz (The Sound of Music's Christopher Plummer), and he one day meets fellow exploring enthusiast Ellie (Elie Docter). They grow and marry each other, and over the years they try to achieve their dream of travelling to the Lost Land in South America, but many things stop them, and the dream disappears completely after the sad death of Ellie. Carl (Edward Asner, voice in hundreds of cartoons) is now lonely and grumpy, but still remembers the promise he made to his wife, it is only when he hits a construction worker forcing him to move out to a retirement home that this may actually happen. Before the men can take Carl with them, a huge cover unveils thousands of helium balloons that manage to lift the whole house away, with directional wings to take Carl to South America. He is inadvertently accompanied by a young stowaway, eight-year-old scout Russell (Jordan Nagai) trying to earn his last assisting the elderly badge. After encountering a storm and nearly getting lost they manage to land safely on a cliff of South America's Lost Land, and tying the house to themselves they start walking to find the spot above the large waterfall. On the way they are joined by a rare colourful flightless bird, probably the ""snipe"", that Russell names Kevin, and a talking (with a translator) dog named Dug (Bob Peterson). While walking Carl meets his childhood hero, Charles Muntz, missing for many years trying to find the rare bird that he has to become evil over to catch. There is the point where Carl wants to be alone, determined to fulfil his promise to Ellie, but he finds the adventure book is more full than he originally thought. So he plucks up the courage to go after Russell, the bird and Dug and stop the nasty Muntz from succeeding, in the end he even manages to let his house go, attend Rusell's badge receiving reception, and get a new and I guess better house. Also starring Delroy Lindo as Beta, Jerome Ranft as Gamma and Pixar regular John Ratzenberger as Construction Foreman Tom. The montage near the beginning of Carl and Ellie together with music by Michael Giacchino is beautiful, the film is full of extravagant colour, and all the characters make this a wonderful heart-warming story that makes you believe your never to old to follow your heart and your dreams (sounds corny I know, but it's true). It may be aimed a little more at adults, but with plenty of stuff for the younger generation too, it is a visually astonishing, funny, moving, and imaginative, essential animated viewing. It won the Oscars for Best Music, Original Score for Michael Giacchino, and Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated for Best Sound Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Film, and Best Music, and it was nominated for Best Original Screenplay, and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film for Best Original Score.

While I was obviously extremely excited to see Up, never did I expect it - or, to be honest. Well, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Simply put, Up is a perfect movie.This movie is freakin' hilarious. Without a doubt the funniest film that Pixar has ever made, each and every character in Up provides their own bit of humor.

"SPIRITED AWAY","Darth_Osmosis","6 June 2018","I had high hopes for ""Up"". I don't think it let me down. Maybe I let it down. I don't know.I think the secret to Pixar's success is that they knew before anyone else that a great children's movie is a great movie, full stop. You don't have to transparently attempt to please both children and adults: this was what was wrong with a lot of terrible family movies, like ""North"". Adult humour seems stunningly out of place in a movie best enjoyed by children, and the truisms children might be hearing for the first time are often ones that adults can do with being reminded of.At least, that's what I always thought. ""Up"" starts very well, with an opening montage that makes everybody's list of saddest movie scenes. When the central premise of the flying house suspended by balloons is established, we realise the movie is off to a great start, but where it goes from there just isn't as interesting, and it lost me repeatedly.Maybe I'll watch it again later, now that I know what to expect, and hopefully I'll be able to replace this review with a more positive one.","

From The Incredibles onward, they've been set on making their films more and more appealing to adults, and they've done it - Up can be enjoyed by the entire family - more so that Wall-E, which was too slow paced in its first half for children.The feelings of melancholy and nostalgia in Up, especially the opening montage, are authentic and truly touching; which doesn't mean that Up is not also incredibly funny. The second half is a romp of an adventure movie with lots of action and lots of fun; it's not as powerful as the beginning, but it's also not a letdown like the second half of Wall-E. Whether it's melancholy or insane, Up remains consistently good throughout, and it's one of the best CGI features made yet.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","aeriz","3 June 2003","Walt Disney has done better animated films in the past. This one is rather average. But it is important because it shows a radical change in the targeted audience. The concept of family audience has completely changed. The kids are no longer accompanied by their parents but by their grand-parents. So the film targets these grand-parents as a potential audience and is built on two main characters, the child and the senior citizen. The whole film is based on this crossing over three generations. Then the film is also aiming at a younger audience that is living in decomposed more than recomposed families and the child is thus living with his father and another woman than his mother, and he is systematically betrayed, in spite of what he mat say, by his father. The boy scouts are shown as particularly father-centered if not male-chauvinistic by not allowing a boy to be supported by another person than his father when receiving medals in some ritual ceremony, the father or another fatherly man, but not the mother. A very long tradition with Walt Disney: their support of the family structure like with Ebenezer Scrooge in the famous Christmas Carol, or of course Snow White and Cinderella. Fathers are not particularly enhanced and step mothers are frankly demonized. The animals of the film are not essential, just some kind of mirror in which children will be able to recognize their phantasms and dreams. But this film is absolutely Anglo-Saxon and based on a myth from this culture and this culture only, or nearly, and particularly the English branch of that myth and culture, the Lost World of Conan Doyle, the belief in the existence of a pocket or virginal nature surviving behind un-crossable mountains that can only be reached by air with a blimp or a flying house. It is thus normal to have some paradise cataract and a bird of paradise, a giant one mind you, and of course this bird will have three chicks, a trinity that is there to sanctify this virginal world, this garden of Eden. At a time when Jules Verne was looking for adventures that contained a great quantity of danger, Conan Doyle was dreaming of the rediscovery of the garden of Eden. Charles Muntz has little to do with Captain Nemo. In fact he has no humanity at all, not even the good sense to forget about, and forgive, the dumbness of human beings. He is ready to kill a child and destroy a bird of paradise and doom its – her actually – chicks to perdition for his own vanity. It is these particularities that make the film interesting, but it does not have the finesse and the subtlety of Ratatouille. The allusions to American culture are numerous but it would be fastidious to give them all, like the small house surrounded by high rise buildings (Death of a Salesman). These allusions are aimed at the adult and elderly audience of course. But I can't resist asking one final question: is the Shady Oaks retirement home covering some shady business or some shaky eugenic mentality concerning the elderly?

"SPIRITED AWAY","mattedesa","24 May 2004","Pixar always makes amazing films, like Wall-e, Ratatouille, or The Incredibles. The ones that aren't amazing are usually pretty decent, like Cars or A Bugs Life. Finding Nemo has always been my favorite because of how great the story was, the beauty presented in the movie, and the variety of characters it had. Up has two of the three things Finding Nemo has – Beautiful scenery and a wonderful story. Up's story isn't as smart or complex as Ratatouille or Finding Nemo, but it's still entertaining and fun. Up doesn't have that many characters, but it is Pixar's most emotional movie to date.The first ten minutes of Up will make you want to cry. It sure made me want to give up my god-like manliness. Those that don't give in to Up's emotional beginning don't have a heart. I like how the story isn't all about Carl (the old guy) and his sad story. The movie sheds some light on the other lead's (the little kid, Russel, who accompanies Carl. He also happens to be Asian!!) background. Carl is mourning his wife, while the film briefly explains Russel's issues with his father.Although there wasn't a variety of characters in the movie, there was still a whole bunch of dogs, a colorful bird, and another old dude, who happens to be the villain. The dog, if you've seen the trailer, is Dug. Dug is a very cute, playful, and loyal dog, who appears to be a Lab. Kevin is a beautiful female prehistoric bird that the other old guy, Charles, is searching for. The movie is fun because it offers so many laughs from the four characters of Carl, Russel, Kevin, and Dug. Charles, however, is a different story.Charles Muntz is Carl's childhood hero. He's a famous explorer that, about 70 years ago, discovered the bones of some kind of bird that no one has every seen before (we, the audience, know that it's Kevin's race). Scientists claim that Charles made up everything, so Charles swore that he would find a living specimen. This is where Kevin comes in. Charles spent the rest of his life trying to capture Kevin, and when Russel and Carl grow fond of Kevin, the two parties are at an opposition. Now, Carl finds his childhood hero trying to kill him.I respected Charles and his character in the movie, but I soon grew intolerant of him. I understand that he spent his life trying to capture Kevin, and it's his passion. However, Charles becomes an asshole to the other characters when they get in his way. Charles even endangers a little 7-year-old boy, Russel, just to get what he wants. By the end of the movie, I felt that Charles got what he deserved.Up is the best film I have seen all year, and is the only movie so far of 2009 that I've given a 10 out of 10. I can't think of any animated movie, or live-action, that has been as emotional, sad, funny, and charming as Up has been. I also loved the animated short film that appeared before Up, called Partly Cloudy. I liked how the short film kind of has a similar setting as Up, and I think that Partly Cloudy has a story that Pixar could actually make into a feature film. One think that disappointed me at the theater, though, was the fact that the trailer for Toy Story 3 wasn't shown. Every Pixar movie has a teaser trailer of the next movie that's going to be released, so I kind of felt cheated. Even though I saw the trailer for it already, I still would have liked to see it on the big screen, and also for everyone else in the theater to know about it.","

Carl Fredricksen ties balloons to his home and takes off for South America so that he can land his house on some obscure falls. However, he soon learns that an 8-year-old wilderness scout who was trying to assist the elderly so he could get a badge was on the premises when the house took off.This is one of the sweetest films imaginable, reminiscent in the beginning of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" - a young boy has dreams of travel, marries his childhood friend; the couple takes on the refurbishment of an old house and finds that life gets in the way of their travel ambitions. Later on, the film becomes a real adventure story, with talking dogs, exotic birds, and a crazed explorer. Fredericksen looks like Spencer Tracy and has the voice of Ed Asner; the explorer, a childhood hero of Fredericksen's, looks like Kirk Douglas and has the voice of Christopher Plummer. All of the voices are delightful.I don't generally care for animated films, but I was swept away by warmth and heart of this one, not to mention its magnificent detail and beauty.

I admit to enjoying it more the second time around, but I still have mixed feelings about this one.The film begins (and ends, as it turns out) with such a sweet, yet sad story. We all have dreams when we're young and carefree, but when reality steps in, some of these dreams are brushed off as fantasies and we loose the enthusiasm to pursue our dreams. 'Up' depicts this to perfection, and I can certainly relate.The film then becomes a charming little fantasy adventure. I enjoyed the difference of opinion between the 78-year old hero, Carl, and the adventurer kid, who - as it turns out - was not quite as adventurous as he believed he was. The adventure element is exciting, although not in the least remotely realistic. Then again, this is a fantasy. They meet a lot of interesting characters along the way and despite numerous obstacles, Carl's determination is never doused.There's a lot to admire here, and I believe the film sends out a strong message. Maybe I'll watch it again after a few years, and who knows, might enjoy it even more then...","

Just go with the fantasy, talking dog collars and all. There's always plenty going on in a Pixar film.I'll skip over the love story, which stands out, to a couple of less conspicuous points. I loved the dogs, who spoke what we'd like to think are dog thoughts. And anyone who thinks they lowered the tone of the movie should consider the wide range of dog behavior that Pixar left out and most animation studios would have wallowed in.I also loved the contrasts between the 8 year olds: Carl and Ellie delighted with a few found objects and their imaginations, and Russell laden with every piece of gear money could buy. And the contrast between the two views of nature: Muntz, wanting to catch it and put it in a museum Teddy Roosevelt style, and Russell wanting to leave it in place. The manly hero of 70 years ago has soured into a fascistic bully by modern standards. The politics are a lot more subtle than The Incredibles or Wall-E, but they're in there just the same.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","kosmasp","5 July 2020","Pixar has never disappointed (so long as we block Cars from our memory). After Wall-E, the bar was set higher than ever. Wall-E was a beautiful haunting picture, made not for children but more for people willing to absorb the imagery without needing to be guided by dialogue. Despite the success of Wall-E, I think Pixar realized how it may have alienated children to some extent with its long first act, and has included more colour and dialogue in their next picture, Up. However, even if a slightly less mature picture at times than its predecessor, Up ranks among the best Pixar films to date and may actually be its most haunting.Up is the story of 78-year old widower Carl Frederickson. After the death of his wife, he finally decides to do what they always dreamed of doing and having a house on Paradise Falls. However, when his houseship has an unexpected passenger in young boy scout (sorry, ""Wilderness Explorer"") Russell, his journey becomes something else entirely.Carl is probably the most tragic character Pixar has ever made, possibly even including Wall-E. The opening montage of his life is probably the single most tragic thing I've ever seen in an animated feature. Even Russell, the requisite annoying-yet-noble child, has his share of tragedy surrounding him, also dealing with themes much more mature than the standard studio. It's a tale of a man trying to live his life in its twilight, and its done wonderfully.Of course, no kids want to see a tragedy, so importantly, Up is very funny. There's a man with an army of talking dogs, from which much humour ensues (particularly from Dug, the ""SQUIRREL!"" dog from the trailer, as well as Alpha, a Rottweiler with a malfunctioning collar). Then there's the large-bird-thing Kevin, also producing some very funny material. Despite the tragedy of the whole story, you really can't help but be entertained, and certainly this is a very funny movie.I do have my complaints, however. The climax seems too stereotypical, a pitfall of all kids movies. It works, however, even if it doesn't blow away. Also, as a physics major, I have some issues to settle with the mechanics of walking around dragging a flying house, but its a pure fantasy movie, and eventually i coerced my brain into shutting up in that respect.One final note: the 3D aspect. I did see it in 3D, and was very impressed. Unlike most 3D movies, there was not a single ""OMG 3D"" moment in Up (forgive the expression). The use was subtle, yet did add a degree of immersion to the film. It also made the dogs that much more frightening at times. The movie definitely is very good in 2D, but the 3D gives it an extra layer, even if not necessary. If the idea does make you queasy, go for the 2D, because the 3D does not drive the soul of the film.Overall, Up is a triumph. Pixar seems more focused than ever with these last few films, and I'm absolutely loving it. If this implies that Toy Story 3 will be the best yet, bring it on.NOTE: There's a 3D Toy Story 3 trailer attached. That makes it worth admission alone.NOTE: The short film before the movie (as standard with Pixar) is not their best, but its very cute and works its magic to warm you up for the film.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","kavalaviktor","18 August 2022","It was a good movie, but not great. The beginning sequence was well-done, tender, and sweet, but it was not quite as emotionally affecting as I expected. I would have liked to see a couple more scenes of Carl and Ellie interacting with dialog because the scenes with them as kids didn't quite cut it for me...I liked how it set up Carl's instantaneous love for Ellie, foreshadowing the endurance of his love for her, but her character came off as unique (which was good) but also kind of annoying. If we got to see a little more of her character and dynamic with Carl, maybe a scene of her showing some love for him, I think the following music-only sequence and the whole movie would have been more emotionally compelling.Anyway, Carl as a character was a good protagonist, not the stereotypical, grumpy old man one might expect but instead a quiet, relatable human being. Russel, on the other hand, wasn't the best counterpart for Carl; he had some good moments, but was overall pretty typical and annoying at parts.And while I liked Kevin and Dug, I didn't care for their introduction and their plots. The fact that a giant bird, a pack of talking dogs, and a crazy old man comprise a large part of the story doesn't sit well with me, especially since the movie at first seemed to be rooted in realism (a balloon-propelled house isn't entirely realistic, of course, but it is not cartoonish like the aforementioned elements are).I would have overall preferred if the movie kept a sense of realism to it; there are plenty of ways to have adventures without all that hyper-cartoonish stuff. Even Muntz was a bit cartoonish for such a movie. However, while I would have liked the movie better without these unrealistic plots, they ended up working pretty well once the real point of them as a new adventure for Carl--an adventure to bring him and Russel together in a strong way and for a common good--was more firmly established and explored. However, this purpose still could have been accomplished in a less cartoonish way.As for humor, I didn't find many of the jokes to be funny. Maybe a couple were, but overall, it was kind of weak on humor. Several gags were predictable, and even those that were decent weren't great. I also think the writers thought Russel was a lot funnier than he actually was. And as for the emotion, there were some lines and scenes that seemed forced (for example, Russel's stories about his father), but there were other scenes that got the emotion just right; it worked best when it was understated and subtle.My favorite scene in the movie was when Carl looked through Ellie's ""Adventure Book"" and saw the photos of their enduring marriage inside with the final note of ""Thanks for the adventure. Now have a new one!"" A very simple yet powerful scene, in my opinion. And while I found the ending to be very predictable and the scene with the badge lacked the emotional impact it wanted to have, I did like the final scene of Carl and Russel eating ice cream and counting cars (unfortunately, it was the first time I felt a real bond between the characters.) Anyway, the end credits were really great too, very nicely summing up the whole message of the film...one of my favorite parts of the whole movie, actually. And this message of everyday life being an adventure when spent with someone you love was really nice, one of the best things about the movie.Technically speaking, the visuals were pretty great. I saw it in 3D, and it utilized the 3D well without overdoing it. The only thing that bothered me a little was that parts of Carl looked strange...his ears and hands mainly. But overall, really nice-looking movie. Oh, and the music (particularly the old-fashioned piano music) was awesome.In précis, probably worthy of a B/B-. Tentative grade, but there it is. Didn't reach the heights of emotion and beauty of ""Wall-E""; didn't as successfully accomplish the feeling of friendship and fun like ""Toy Story"" did, but still a fairly solid Pixar film.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","La Gremlin","30 May 2003","I saw Up today and I've been waiting for it to come out. But sadly I thought I would enjoy it more than I really did. It started out great. I agree with most of the critics that the montage showing the two lovers growing together and the loss of the wife was really something akin to the ""When she loved me"" scene in Toy Story 2. And the end of the movie was very touching but in between it was predictable and I have to say very boring. Needless to say the animation was, well PIXAR, can't say anything bad about it. The colors were brilliant and the characters lifelike as usual. But the last two movies made by PIXAR were more for adults than kids. My grandson was bored with this movie and WALL-E especially after all of the popcorn was gone.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Tweekums","28 June 2008","I give one star for the fantastic animation and voice-acting. This movie is indeed very beautiful to look at and the voices fit the characters.Unfortunately, there's an overwhelmingly bad about this movie, hence the low score. Bad Advertising - This movie-poster and trailers give the impression that this is a lighthearted and fun movie. Colorful balloons, funny looking bird, bright lit sky. The back of the DVD even says it's a fun-filled adventure full of laughter. What we get is a very depressing, sad, boring, frightening and mean-spirited movie with the occasional attempt at a funny scene that lasts a second or two. The only thing that had me giggle was the bird and the scene where the old man imagines dropping the kid from the house.Lack of plot - I agree with other reviewers, it seems that they had a great idea and once they get to their destination this movie hits the drain. Instead of the goofy bird, we get dogs that can talk with collars (I thought they were creepy) and a maniac who wants to kill the main characters to capture the goofy bird. Was this at all in the advertisement or back of the DVD? Nope. And what's up with the adventurer and his age? He looks younger than Carl, but should be about 30 years older. And why wouldn't a collar that makes dogs talk and able to understand humans not be more interesting to show than that goofy bird? Heck, even a collar that makes dogs understand human emotions as well? Nope, only goofy birds are good enough for scientists.Depressing - The characters aren't likable (except the bird) and there's a lot of violence, sad moments, scary moments... I also thought it was very unneeded with the aggressive dogs. The moment where Kevin is caught in the net and taken away from her babies was also depressing. This whole movie is a huge downer. I don't mind depressing animated movies if they are done well. ""The Land Before Time"" is an excellent movie which faced many difficult things, but had enough humor and charm to balance it. This movie also started with killing off the funniest character, Ellie, by having her grow up into an old lady and die of cancer. Now that set me up in a bad mood from the very start.This isn't a movie I would want to watch again. I could barely make it through the last 30 minutes of the movie. The ending was disappointing and predictable.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","andreiz2k","1 April 2004","Now here's an unusual movie. Pete Docter's ""Up"" portrays elderly Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) attaching balloons to his house and sailing it to a South American waterfall and finding even more than he bargained for. I've never been a fan of Disney, but this one had some out-of-the-ordinary stuff (for a Disney movie, that is), namely when Carl scornfully calls someone a hippie. As far as I can tell, the major theme is the completion of long-standing promises - Carl's deceased wife had long dreamed of going to the waterfall - and Carl's return from the brink of total senility.All in all, ""Up"" is not my favorite movie, but worth seeing. Also starring Christopher Plummer, Jordan Nagai, Bob Peterson, and John Ratzenberger, and even former ""Saturday Night Live"" cast member Laraine Newman in a supporting role.Squirrels can be a problem. My parents recently installed bird feeders, and the squirrels always try to get into them.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","bix171","2 August 2003","Yes, another movie from Pixar!!! That name alone is a quality assurance. Though I must admit that I didn’t quite find this movie any improvement from their previous, but it is still very much fun to watch and enjoy myself.The story is brilliant as always - really moving and humorous. And who could forget that 5 minutes montages, visually explain the story of Carl’s life without words. This time around the Pixar decide to take a little turn as we look as life itself rather than other point of view like their previous film – Toys, Bugs, Monsters, and so on. But they still managed to keep all the charm by adding such a lovable character to talking dogs, and colourful birds.Anyway the story is beautiful, only problem was at the time I have already seen most of the funny stuff in the trailer; so many of the stuff didn’t come much of a surprise to me. The flow of the movie is just great and with Russell (Little scout) around, everything is so lively and very much cute!! Also his stoutness and little beady eyes, added to the cuteness. There is a pretty good chemistry between almost every character. Though, despite all the praise I have for the movie (maybe a little bias) I still the movie lack one thing that really woos me. I’m not sure what it is? Maybe it was set in the ‘60s, or did I find the colour a little old and not colourful enough, or the backdrop was just plain and almost empty - I’m not sure.But overall I’m sure I will like it a whole lot better after a while and re-watch it. I’m pretty much sure about that!!! And the kids will absolutely love it.Season to Watch: It’s Pixar!!! Russell is really a lovable character.Reason Not To: Personal Dislike of animated film.Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A-)","

"SPIRITED AWAY","Aprigo","3 March 2006","It's become a tradition for me to go watch the latest Pixar movie when it comes out. This studio is the only one I trust enough to always blindly go to their movies. There's no greater cinematic injustice than wait for the DVD.Movies like Up keep rewarding me for such loyalty. In this movie, we meet Carl Fredricksen, a 78-year-old man who decides to fulfill a pledge he made to his wife when they were still children: to visit South America. Their lives pass by in bliss, but without their dreams of adventure fulfilled; but when she dies and Carl faces loneliness he comes up with the most hilarious plan to make his dreams come true: he ties thousands of balloons to his house and just flies away.By chance he receives an unwelcome guest: Russell, a 7-year-old boyscout trying to earn an elderly assistance' badge. Although the boy is initially an annoyance to the grouchy Carl, eventually the two become great friends and teach each other valuable lessons.Like every Pixar movie, the story and characters are the main draw of the movie. Sure, the animation is spectacular, but which mega-studio can't get the same animation Pixar can? On the other hand, the screenplays Pixar comes up with are always simple but beautiful, not to mention excellent at visual storytelling. Wall-E was practically a silent movie; and even if there's quite a lot of chit-chat in Up, it's the ability to express ideas and feelings in images, which can be comprehended by children and adults alike, that make it so fascinating and heartbreaking.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","morindur","23 July 2003","Magical. That is the first word that comes to mind when describing this movie. The movie has so many life lessons put into one, but none of them feel forced or are repeated so you start to feel sick. It has the perfect balance of action, everything just melts together and fits together. The mood and the storytelling, how it IS a animation, so over the top things works brilliant, the art direction supports this. I teared up several times during the film, already after few min, and I think you will to. The pacing is brilliant, big concluding finale, nothing really overstays it's welcome. It has a lot of funny, clever jokes. It just puts a big smile onto your face, while also touching you in deep places, and with stuff we all think off. We want to do this, we want to do that. I know I do, forget to live in the now. Get over the past, it only does one thing, and that is hold you down, which this movie literally shows time again. Each time he makes bad decisions because of the past, the house gets lower and lower and harder to carry. It's just a fantastic movie, I've seen more movies then I can count, and I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time. Everything blends together perfectly, I couldn't find a bad thing, even if I tried very hard. Thanks for reading this, I hope you enjoyed the movie just as much as I did. And have a great day!Just some notes I wrote down quickly when watching it, ill just put them here in the end, if anyone would be interested. Important moment. Instead of trying to save what is already living ""Kevin"" A new partner/friend, he is still to bound by his past, his old love.Whenever he makes bad calls he stumbles, and drags, everything is a chore (I don't care about my writings being perfectly written, I do no corrections etc. I hope you can live with that, I myself prefer the raw stuff. When everything is too sterile, it's just boring to read. Errors is what gives personality to you, and to your writing.)","

"SPIRITED AWAY","trvolk","11 November 2002","yes, this review contains tons of spoilers, so if you read it - you probably won't want to see the movie.. UP has been peddled to us by Pixar studio and many critics as Pixar's ""funniest cartoon ever"", well, some add ""arguably"" to this sentence, which did not make it any less misleading.. don't get me wrong, i love Pixar and all the masterpieces they gave us over the years, which only adds to my surprise and disappointment over UP - such a professional and famous studio either consciously joined other dishonest movie factories in an effort to advertise their product falsely, or for some unknown reason no one at Pixar understands what they created..and now - this is the movie in a nutshell (and a million spoilers, so you may want stop reading right here):1. boy meets girl, they both are mad about famous explorer and dream of traveling to some south American land ""lost in time"" discovered by this guy, who actually disappears from public view being ridiculed by scientists who do not believe the skeleton of an unknown bird he found is real.. well, boy marries girl..2. in 5 silent minutes narrated by the music Pixar geniuses show us the life of this cute couple, from happy marriage to the moment they discover she can't have kids (or was it a miscarriage you tried to show us in this happy funny movie, Pixar guys ?) to two of them getting old to her dying from cancer (or what was it that killed her, Pixar friends ?) and him being stuck in the same house, which is now surrounded on all sides by new high-rises, while some developers looking like men in black try to squeeze the poor old guy out of his house and his piece of land.. i'll be honest, the short story of their life ending with wife's' death brought me to tears.. and i was going to see a funny cartoon..also, as we're shown this couple spent all their life in the same house, and husband never achieved anything beyond the position of balloon vendor in a local park.. what the hell ? 3. old dude is visited by an overweight inapt boy scout who wants to help him in any way to earn ""help elderly"" badge..4. old man is fed up, he attacks one of the construction workers, court rules he has to vacate the house, and right when two indifferent dudes from assisted living place come to pick him up he fills up thousands of balloons he has from his job with gas and launches his whole house into aerial adventure.. let me also say that throughout the whole movie he constantly looks at the pictures of his deceased wife and talks to her, which is very painful to watch..5. Fat boy scout somehow jumps aboard the house, and is stuck there with old man...6. they arrive to south America by means of huge storm..7. miraculously they find themselves almost at the very spot old man dreamed reaching all his life.. they meet a weird talking dog (she usesspecial translating electronic collar) and a huge weird bird..8. they travel together trying to land the house at the designated water fall, while we find out that this dog is one of many ""talking dogs"" raised and put in servitude by the famous explorer, who is still, for like 60 years hiding with his huge blimp in a cave in the vicinity somewhere, trying to catch this rare bird, yes the very bird that old man and fat boy scout befriended.. old man meets explorer (who is apparently 150 years old at this point, but looks as ""young"" as old man), soon they figure out that Mr. explorer is cold-blooded killer who is ready to dispatch of anyone standing between him and the bird, and an ""indiana jones"" type sequence of events transpires before our eyes, during which the meanest talking dogs and Mr. evil explorer plunge to their deaths, old man looses the house, but comes in possession of the blimp and everything on it, as well as the army of remaining talking dogs..good adventure, terrific graphics, but...could this cartoon be any more sad ? and did i mention that poor fat boy scout lives with stepmother and abandoned by his real dad ? i don't know about you, but i wish there was a law that would let me sue a movie studio for false and misleading advertising..if i knew how depressing UP is - i'd never gone to see it..yes, there is ton of ""funny"" stuff in this movie, the interaction of old man and boy scout and talking dog and huge bird, and every character's graphics is funny and cartoonish, but none of this joyful ha-ha stuff manages to even remotely disguise the extremely sad plot lines..old man is heartbroken about his wife the entire movie, the whole balloon journey is about fulfilling her dream of getting to this south American place (why they never tried to get there in their 60 years together is beyond understanding, particularly given that they did not have any kids to look after (we were explained that all too well)), the boy scout is heartbroken about his dad leaving him, the bird gets injured by evil dogs (though recovers later), the famous explorer reveals himself as a homicidal maniac, and so forth...yes, as a story about the unlikely friendship, helping friends, fulfilling dreams and other crap like this - this cartoon is great..but as an ""arguably"" the funniest Pixar work it fails so miserably, so breathtakingly and profoundly that i am nothing but sorry i saw it..in no way it is for kids, and adults should know how heartbreaking the whole thing is..Pixar, why ?","

"SPIRITED AWAY","jose-cruz53","7 October 2012","You might think that from my summary that I hate Pixar films. The opposite is actually true, I love Pixar films, they're wildly original and inventive with brilliant, unforgettable characters and a narrative with heart. I've not seen a bad Pixar film yet (although I haven't seen Cars). I've been wanting to see Up for a very long time and finally my little (well actually, incredibly tall) blonde friend decided to buy it for me this Christmas in Blu-ray no less (he spares no expense!) and what do I find, after I had expectations as high as Carl's floating house? I find probably the best Pixar film ever! It's probably even the best animated film I've ever seen too. Up ticks every single box and more. It has a genius original plot, sensational characters, a huge heart, is absolutely hilarious and is also incredibly entertaining whilst balancing all of these things.Up starts with one of the most touching flashback and montage sequences've ever seen. I can't think of a film that gets you teary in the first 5 minutes, but Up manages it. Whilst it didn't squeeze out a very small man tear, it did undeniably move me and also completely engage me into this old man's super sweet life. The character of Carl is so beautifully realised, as he clings onto the past and never having the chance to have a child, his only lasting aspiration is to go to Paradise Falls, where he promised to take his wife (Ellie) all those years ago. The trouble is that Ellie has now sort of become the house and so that obviously has to tag along too.The image of the house floating off into the sky has already and rightly become iconic. It's a bizarre, yet weirdly awe-some sight and could be symbolism for getting away from a crazy world (like the escapism you get from watching Up!). Now, Carl isn't entirely flawless, he has a temper and there's this rather deep scene where Carl has to go to court after causing someone a head injury! He was also not very nice to a cute and hilarious boy, who happens to be a stowaway on Carl's house. However, of course by the end of this epic journey Carl begins to realise the greatest adventure of all is having a child, or a surrogate grand-child in this case. It's enough to produce tears and chills, seeing such an odd couple become so close.The look of the film is nothing short of breath-taking. I saw Up in blu-ray and it's probably the best blu-ray I've ever seen and is right up there with The Dark Knight! It looks crisper than a Walker's factory and helps to show off the film's incredibly vibrant colours and imagination. The animation has such depth and detail, and the scope is so huge you can't help but feel transported to another world. And whilst the film can be wonderfully surreal (talking dogs flying aeroplanes anyone?) it never loses sight of its plot and characters. Now the characters are nothing short of genius. Dug the dog is an absolute hoot, and Kevin the bird is just as hilarious. Dug actually speaks like how you'd imagine a dog to speak, it's brilliant! The relationships between the colourful characters are also nothing short of touching and engaging. The theme of protecting nature is much more involving and less patronising than Avatar's attempt at conveying the message. The screenplay is full of wit and endless imagination which helps Up to become an instant classic. I was riveted by the grand chase scenes and profoundly moved by the slower, more character-driven scenes.Up is the full package. It's a highly engaging and hilarious animation with a fantastic sense of adventure. The wonderful directing and screenplay will have you hooked on one of the greatest animated adventures ever filmed. It's perfect for children but also offers so much more for adults, as it boldly explores some heart-wrenching ideas and touching relationships. By the end of it I felt as uplifted as Carl's house! It's a tale for our times, a wonderful feat of the imagination and a refreshingly original tale. Pixar's out done itself again, but Up will be preposterously difficult to beat. Do yourself a favour and watch Up on blu-ray!","

"SPIRITED AWAY","SimonJack","19 October 2022","When I saw the preview months ago, I knew this latest Pixar offering should really be seen in 3D for the best effect. However, upon watching, I feel that the best feature of this 5-star film is not really the 3D animation, it is the heart upon which the heartwarming story of Carl and Ellie Frederickson is so firmly based.From the trailer, I already knew this would not be the typical Disney-Pixar film. First of all, the lead character is a cantankerous elderly guy! I was really curious how this story would flow. And true to Pixar's amazing record of film-making, ""Up"" belongs up there with the best of them.That wordless montage on the evolution of the relationship between Carl and his wife Ellie from childhood to old age was beautiful and very touching. Maybe kids will not get affected, but certainly adults will be hard-pressed to hold back their tears in these few minutes that start of the film.The ""spirit of adventure"" upon which the love affair of Carl and Ellie was founded was finally realized when Carl was pushed to the wall by modern developments around their house. Carl had no other recourse but to go for broke and bring their house to the edge of Paradise Falls in Venezuela, as Ellie always dreamed since her childhood. He did this in the most original way, only possible in an animated film like this.The relationships Carl builds with his unwitting stowaway boy scout Russell, and later the strange bird Kevin and talking dog Doug, were slow to build up. But again, in true Pixar fashion, the power of true friendships shines through adversities encountered. Great story-telling indeed. This is a movie truly for all ages to enjoy. Do not miss it! The 3D is not essential for you to fall in love with it.","

However, when the film was about 2/3 finished I totally lost interest. So did my grandson who I took along to see it! (I allow for the fact that the film was not aimed at retired old men!) Others have pointed out the plot holes and nonsensical features (dogs talking through electronic collars? Why not just give them voices? After all, it is a cartoon!) But I think the thing that lost me was the total absence of purpose. One reviewer philosophized that the movie teaches the importance of dedication to a task, even if it takes your whole life. Well, I suppose it suggests that, but the same point could have been presented with a much more interesting plot. I had thought my 5 year old grandson, at least, would enjoy another PIXAR popcorn-ball of fluff. Instead, I think he really only enjoyed the popcorn I bought for him.","

Pixar has delivered some timeless classics like Toy Story, Monsters Inc. Finding Nemo, and the most recent Wall-E but this one has to be by far my favorite. Walking into the theater i was expecting a typical kids movie with a couple of laughs, crazy scenarios and funny characters but i got much MUCH more than that. The short film Party-cloudy couldn't have been a more appropriate warm up of what was to come in this movie because that short film had me tearing a little. The first 5 minutes of this story gave me such a nostalgic feeling of when i saw Bambi as a kid couldn't help but cry. The start of the movie had me moved with having Carl and his friend Ellie venture into the start of their lives and the close and unconditional love they shared for each-other. An amazing and almost too perfect couple put in a Disney film you think they could never have such a tragic event happen to this couple. But sadly, the animators of Pixar leave you bawling with this tear-jerker. The simple things about this intro really got to me like how they showed when they were kids and Ellie flew a balloon with a paper attached to it into Carl's room and Carl did the same thing to her when she was in the hospital. After his wife died, your heart sinks and you think to yourself how can i watch the rest of this movie after witnessing such a depressing moment? The scene afterwards with the bulldozers almost crushing his mailbox with their handprints on it and then wacking the guy in the head was almost hard to watch. But of course Pixar pulls it off again and takes the audience on a surreal adventure with great witticisms and characters. Russell's character was well portrayed and brought a lot of comedy and a great companion to Mr. Fredrickson. The dog 'Dug' brought a lot of great humor to the film and lines that had me laughing out of my chair at times. And the character of Charles Muntz, Carl's once childhood hero and now enemy was a great addition to the plot. All in all, this movie defines what real family movie is. It is literally for any age out there and you will enjoy it no matter where, when or who you are watching it with. A movie like Up will be frozen in the Pixar vault for a long time and other movies to come will have to be greatly designed to beat this classic. 10/10 easily","

"SPIRITED AWAY","rh86","23 October 2006","Up is everything you could ask for in a animation film and more. This is Disney/Pixar's first film in 3D. I have been a bit wary about the use of this technology, but I can't deny that it looks breathtaking here. There are no cheap effects and it is only used to make the film look better, giving it more depth and character. It's not just eye candy and it doesn't take away from the story.The story follows Carl Frederickson, an elderly man who has had a dream for most of his life to fly to South America to see Paradise Falls, the place where his favorite explorer, Charles Muntz, last visited. When life pushes him to the limit, he decides to take matters into his own hands. Being a Balloon salesman, he transforms his house into an air ship, tying on hundreds if not thousands of balloons to life him above the landscape and off to Paradise Falls. Unfortunately for him but fortunately for us, he has a tag along. Russell is a young Wilderness Explorer (like a Boy Scout) who happens upon his house just as he lifts off. The two are stuck together until they reach the falls.Along the way we encounter a strange bird of paradise Russell calls Kevin as well as a dog named Dug who has a collar that allows him to talk. All distractions and annoyances for Carl but friends to Russell.This is a wonderful story that makes you truly happy when it's all over. I thought WALL-E had some deep and profound messages like staying ""green"" and the dangers of obesity, but Up talks about fertility, life and death, companionship, fatherhood, as well as the generic loyalty, the importance of friendship, and having fun.Like all Pixar films (especially lately), there is always one aspect of the animation that is constantly being tested and glorified. In Finding Nemo we see how the water effects the objects in it as well as the light. Ratatouille showed how fog and shadows can create mood. Monster's Inc. focused a lot of attention on texture and interacting with the environment (like Sully's fur). In Up we get a lot of depth perception and panoramic views thanks to the 3D technology. There are times when I caught myself practically drooling over how beautiful a shot was. They really do a fantastic job in animating.Another big aspect of the production that has great importance is the voice acting. I think Ellen DeGeneres's voice acting for Dory in Finding Nemo is one of the greatest on screen performances of all time. The voices in Up capture the feelings of the characters perfect. Ed Asner voices Carl. He is grumpy, determined, but there is a lot going on under the surface that slowly rises up as the film progresses. Jordan Nagai voices Russell and gives exactly what we could possibly ask from a child actor: to be himself. Even the co-director and writer Bob Peterson does a great job as the voice of the dog Dug (also the voice of Mr. Ray in Finding Nemo). Other talents like Christopher Plummer, Delroy Lindo, and John Ratzenberger, the only actor to have an appearance in all 10 of the Disney/Pixar feature films.Like most Pixar films, so much relies on the music. My least favorite of the 10 films is Cars, a film that have a heavy modern soundtrack. I like it when they stick to their creative guns and fire off something new and fantastic. They were much better about it with WALL-E, mixing in original with with existing tunes like the Hello, Dolly! soundtrack. A very nice touch. Here with Up we have a brand new score that is inspirational and fitting to the story. There is a sort of waltz like we are floating across a dance floor. It fits quite nicely.Where Up falters is...nowhere. I have seen the film twice already and both times I left completely satisfied. The animation is some of their best and the story is tight and perfect. It stays the course and carries you the entire way. It's beautiful, poetic, and uplifting. Expect to be dazzled and wowed by this one.","

We'll have another contender on our hands for a possible Best Picture nomination but the early release date is a damper on it. It'll definitely be the frontrunner for the Animated Category and screenplay.The colors are exquisite, the storyline is marvelous, and the characters are well thought out and charming. Go catch it and experience the wonder. It's more dramatically stimulating than taking on the comedy notion. It tugs major heart strings and is absolutely heartbreaking. ****/****","

"SPIRITED AWAY","ElMaruecan82","26 June 2017","Animation has had its marks throughout its short history before Up, you have Toy Story really being Pixar's massive contribution and in truth the introduction to computer-animated movies. Up I feel should be remembered for being a massive step in not only how animation is done visually, but also how animations can be compared on the same level as any other movie out there. This is truly a masterpiece, it builds itself into an emotional roller-coaster that also makes you laugh and really this is exactly how to do animation perfectly.The story see's Carl Fredricksen an old man living by himself after his wife has died, that isn't where the plot picks up from though no, first it has to toy with your emotions and oh man the start to this film is tough to not feel something for. We see Carl's life and it has been good to him, it had its hard moments but most times he and his wife were extremely happy together, until she passed away and that is where the story picks up from. Carl made a promise to his wife to set up a house on top of a place called ""Paradise Falls"", a large waterfall somewhere in South America, and he is going to do it with balloons of all things. The film sways around, frantic at times and then sweet again and although that may not sound so good, it is in fact timed to perfection; the movie never loses momentum and keeps you watching from the first second to the last.Pixar haven't just made a great film, they've made an astounding one and also one that very much deserved its Best Picture nomination at the 82nd Academy awards. Pete Docter directs this in a visually stunning way, he not only gets the most out of the rich colours on offer, but he also puts things in that look amazingly real. Jonas Rivera's script is fine as well and really lays the foundations for all the comedy side if this; this is really one movie where physical humour is entwined well with comedy in dialogue. The characters are fantastically developed as well with not only Carl well done, the young boy Russell is finely thought up as well, he and Carl create one of the best duo's in animation movies.The way in which it also uses it's colour to bring out everything is even more impressive, the fine tones of the clothing, the beautiful animation style and the just general way in which this flows is beautiful. It is such a lovable movie as well, one that is maybe recommended for the kids but this is one for the adults too because this is one thing that can make anyone cry, whether that be by the funny bits in this or the heart wrenching moments.So Up, one of the best animations ever, for sure. I don't really have a group of people I would recommend this to but I mean that in a way where I believe that anyone can enjoy this. It's one of Pixar's finest for years and shows they are one of the most consistent movie churners out there, producing film after film that are not only movies that are financially successful, but also one's with big hearts as well.","

In telling a simple adventure story, they cover ground that they had yet to cover before. Both the humor and heartbreak of the film seem completely more mature than any of Pixar's previous works. The film is perfectly paced and structured in a very careful way to allow each moment to have a satisfying and slightly surprising. Pixar continues to amaze not only with their technical bravado, but with their thematic courage. Up is definitely in the uppermost echelon of their work, a hilarious, and in turns heartbreaking, work of great magnitude and power. Visually the film is rich and thrilling and emotionally it is satisfying. I cannot wait to see it again!","

The movie starts with a depressing montage of an young boy meeting, marrying, and then burying the love of his life. They grow old together, childless, after finding out that she is barren, and then the wife dies. That is how UP opens and it only gets worse from there. There is physical assault, the endangerment of a child, savage dogs, fire, more physical assault and death (again). There is nothing uplifting or redeeming about UP and most of the young children in the theatre had to be carried out crying, because sections of it are dark, menacing and terrifying. The parents I was with agreed that this had to be the product of a disturbed mind and castigated Disney for ever releasing such violent dark content. Nobody had any idea how UP got its rating, with all the violence and darkness. This movie can and probably will damage the Disney brand in terms of how much parents trust it in future. Not suitable for children and by no means is it an uplifting, funny or enjoyable film.","

But some of the contrivances are as annoying as they are helpful, for example, the device that lets dogs talk. And then there's the way the floating house seems to drag the action down in places. Still, the many little quirks of an old man embodied in Mr Fredricksen's figure are pretty much breathtaking as is those of a young boy embodied in Russell. Ellie is fleshed out as a character so quickly and assuredly that I was flummoxed trying to imagine what kind of a team could have produced her. But then most of the art work is completely awe-inspiring and entrancing. (I found the bird Kevin to be disappointing, though.) I guess I would have made the story a little less wild, these films deserve to be instant classics, and I can't help feeling some of the more wild parts are going to hold it back. By the way the opening cartoon about storks delivering babies was a complete pleasant surprise and a clear indication of the level of genius at Pixar. I'm guessing they wanted us to practice dropping our mouths open.","

"SPIRITED AWAY","baseballfanjm","21 August 2003","No one at the moment can match Pixar in the world of CGI animation at the moment. They made a lot of instant classics, with only one film being a flop (Cars). No one in Hollywood has even come close, and all studios should follow the Pixar philosophy of story comes first.The plot of Up tells the story of Carl Fredricksen (Edward Asner), an elderly man who's wife Ellie had died and about to face evident from his home. Instead of giving in and going to live in a retirement home, Carl decides to go on the adventure trip to South America that he and his wife were never about to do. He attaches hundreds of helium balloons to his house and floats to South America. But he has a stowaway, Russell (Jordan Nagai), an 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer. When the two reach South America, they come to a strange rainforest, with a large colourful bird which loves chocolate and Russell calls Kevin, and a Golden Retrevier called Dug (Bob Peterson) who has a collar that allows him to talk. With this jungle is a mad elderly explorer, Charles F. Muntz (Christopher Plummer), and Carl and Ellie's childhood hero. He created the collars to allow his pack of dogs to speak, and wants to capture the bird to show to the world.Pixar has a strong philosophy which obviously works. They have a old-fashion style but it works. They is a strong story and character development. The actors in this film were casted because they had the right voice, not cause they are a big name actor. This is a right move, especially because children don't care who voices the film, only if they are good. They is brilliant designs, direction, with excellent jokes, especially Russell and the dogs. There are sight gags, slapstick, but also some more adult-aimed jobs involving observational humour. There is also a good amount of action, some reminding me of Peter Jackson's version of King Kong. They is a emotion element, especially the montage at the beginning of the film. It makes you feel sad for Carl and Ellie. Pixar films also often trend to have a message about family relationships, like Finding Nemo and the Incredibles. This time the focus is on the love between Carl and Ellie, the surrogate relationship between Carl and Russell and Russell need for a fatherly figure. There is also the themes of unfulfilled dramas and hero worship.A perfectly enjoyable film for the whole family.","

They get married and spend their lives together. When Ellie passes away, Carl becomes depressed and forgets about his old promise to Ellie about visiting Paradise Falls in South America. Carl is soon visited by a little boy named Russell, who is trying to get his ""Assisting the Elderly"" badge. Carl soon turns his house into an airship using thousands of balloons. He finds out that Russell was still on his house and assists him in his adventures. Carl runs into his boyhood hero, who actually turns out to be his enemy. With the help of Russell and Dug, the lovable talking dog, Carl tries to save a female bird named Kevin by any means necessary. I highly recommend that you go UP!!!","

"SPIRITED AWAY","gomaster88","8 July 2005","Up is one of those Pixar films that stands out from the rest in telling a story that is more grounded in reality while also having that flair of fantasy that Pixar is known for. The movie follows our main character, Carl (Played by Edward Asner), as he flies his house to South America to fulfill the dream of his deceased wife Ellie, while also being accompanied by Russel (Played by Jordan Nagai), an eight year old who is part of a boy scout troop trying to earn his merit badges. As Russel and Carl walk across the plateau of Paradise Falls, they come into contact with Dug (Played by Bob Peterson), Kevin the bird and the antagonist Charles Muntz (Played by Christopher Plumber), who is on the search for Kevin to win back his honor as an adventurer.One of the best aspects of the film is certain motifs that occur throughout the film's musical scores. During the flash-forward of Carl's entire life at the beginning of the film up until the current era, a song known as ""Married Life"" plays during this segment. Not only does the music work in tandem with the flash-forward, emphasizing the more emotional and impactful sequences during this scene, the combination of notes that comprise the song show up in other scores in the film's soundtrack. The movie really doesn't want to viewer to forget everything that this short sequence represents: The joy and pain shared by Carl and Ellie's love endured through up until the very end of her life. It's the one thing that pushes Carl to fulfill what he promised all those years ago.This leads to the thematic elements of the film. What makes ""Up"" appealing is that the film is all about loss and dealing with that loss. Throughout the film, Carl is motivated to get his home all the way to the other end of Paradise Fall's Plateau because that is what his late wife would've wanted. He promised to her in his childhood that he would take her there and they would have a house right next to the waterfall. However, during the flash-forward of Carl's life, it's revealed that they never had the chance to go out and experience that dream, and the hustle and bustle of real life and all the problems it comes with kept getting in the way of that dream.Carl ended up making promises he couldn't keep with the rest of the supporting cast, which by the time he truly reaches the end of his journey, he finds that his world is even more bleak as his house has been weathered down due to the trip through the jungle and everything is practically in ruin. The only thing he truly had left at that point was Ellie's old journal. He flicks through it, reminiscing about the past, and then it gets to that particular page where Ellie talks about the things she was going to do. When this page is shown throughout the film, it's never flicked past beyond the very first instance at the beginning of the film where all the pages are blank. As Carl laments, he notices a frame of a polaroid, which causes him to flick through all the pages to discover that everything she was going to do was just living her married life with Carl, and the last page gives Carl the last bit of closure he needed:""Thanks for the adventure - Now go have a new one!""The scene that followed, where Carl started moving all the furniture and belongings he accumulated over the years out of the house just to get the house airborne again to follow Russel back to the Muntz's Ship, demonstrated Carl's acceptance as he was slowly letting go of the past that was holding him back throughout the film. After the end of the climax, this is solidified even more so as he chooses the let the house fall into the clouds out of sight, where he finally lets go of the weight he was carrying just so he could move on and go on a new adventure just like his wife wished.To compare the film's theme to another piece of media, the Video Game ""Silent Hill 2"" has a very similar theme where James Sunderland enters the town of Silent Hill in search of his wife Mary, who died three years prior to a disease. As James wanders the town, certain events take place where the supernatural aspect of the town seems to almost torment James about the passing of his wife and, depending on how you play the game, can impact the ending of the story. The ""Leave"" ending has a scene where James gets to talk to Mary one last time, in which she tells him that he should go and live his life without the guilt of her death weighing him down, and James leaves Silent Hill a better person and adopts a little girl named Laura, who was with Mary in her final days. The tones of these two stories are drastically different and written with different audiences in mind, yet I couldn't help but correlate the two overarching themes between each other.Overall, Up is a film that is both fun for the kids and extremely moving for adults. It's a very good film with a genuine message behind it that's all about moving on from hardships and learning to live in the moment.","

First part is loss of innocence, then loss of a baby, loss of the hope of a baby, loss of wife, loss of will, loss of home, loss of father, loss of dreams.

The word on the street was right. There is nothing cheap or sore on the eyes here, just subtle 3D that supports, not replaces, a worthy tale. If this is the direction that 3D is heading in, then I am very excited indeed.Pixar (now owned by Disney) aren't the leading company in animated movies just because of the visual benchmark they continually set. They understand that the story comes first and without it the breathtaking imagery will mean next to nothing. With Up we have an endearing yarn about following your dreams before it is too late, which is genuinely moving for the most part, but it seems to steer into adult territory a little too often. Don't misunderstand, this is a truly wonderful story and it is nice to find a 'kids' movie that isn't afraid to make the audience, both young and old, think, however it could have used a lighter touch to get across the same message. An extra laugh here and there would've been welcomed too.We have seen and loved a toy cowboy and spaceman, the last robot on earth, a clownfish and an ugly green ogre yet Carl is one of the most unlikely protagonists to feature in an animated family movie yet: a grumpy old man. However it is a breath of fresh air to see this square-jawed, button-nosed man in his seventies lead the way in a world that inhabits talking dogs and a female exotic bird named Kevin. His offsider, the loveably pudgy Russell, almost steals the show though. His bumbling voice and priceless facial expressions pave the way to majority of the laughs and subsequently ensure his escapades are the most enjoyable to watch.Toy Story or Finding Nemo this is not.

I see no need for understatement in a 3-D cartoon, especially one that leans so heavily on the fantastic and implausible.

Some frames just stay with you, the mastery of their composition impossible to miss.The choice of characters itself breaks clichés. A grumpy old man as the hero and an amiable obese kid as his ally completely contrast against what one would have thought would be the choice for characters who are supposed to be on an adventure trip to South America. Both characters endear themselves to us as the story moves along.Two things that stood out for me - (a) The initial sequence that chronicles the life of Fredrickson and Ellie together is a master-stroke.

As a big fan of ""Finding Nemo"", I considered/believed that Pixar could never give me a feeling of satisfaction.
I was wrong.At the centre of ""Up"" is Carl Fredricksen,
a grouchy widower and retired balloon salesman in late middle age. He, after the death of his lovely wife, Ellie, finds himself alone in a world where he is disregarded by people around him and in risk of being sent to a retirement home.
For the purpose of not losing the house he spent his whole life in, he decides to go on one last adventure to complete a lifelong dream he shared with Ellie of traveling to Paradise Falls in South America. So he hooks his house up to thousands of balloons and sets off into the unknown, but all doesn't go as planned when he accidentally picks up a stowaway - a young Boy Scout named Russell, who affects on Carl's life positively.Up is funny, heartfelt, and never less than entertaining.There is plenty to like about this movie - from its gorgeous look to a surprisingly touching story.

(2001) and who work at one of modern cinema's most consistent production companies - Pixar Animation Studios. Up is the tenth feature film from Hollywood's Jewel of Creativity following the successes of films such as Toy Story (1995), Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), and Wall.E (2008).This latest picture is another bold step away from what Pixar has done over the decade, and together with Wall.E (which was considerably bold enough), both represent a significant change in priorities in the company's vision. Producing family-friendly fare is a thing of the past. Now they are using CG technology to transcend animation filmmaking, to give the once isolated genre devoted to entertaining five-year-olds a strong cinematic identity, one that mature audiences can find themselves unashamed of appreciating.Up is perhaps the most risky venture by Pixar thus far. The lead character is not a cute fish, or a lovable rat, or a friendly monster, but a short, bespectacled, and grumpy old man with a face as unappealing as a box. How marketable is that? Fears that Up could be Pixar's first real flop are swept away within the first fifteen minutes. The prologue sequence that introduces Carl Fredricksen is a gem both in its execution and its ability to comprehensively and instantly portray the old man as someone we have no difficulty empathizing.Carl's dream of visiting Paradise Falls in South America is triggered to reality when he is forced to relocate to a retirement village. That morning he made his house fly, lifted by thousands of colorful balloons, and propelled by wind as it pushed the curtain-like sails hung out on rails on each side. Russell, a chubby boy with a zest for adventure happened to be on Carl's front porch when the house made its ascent. Together they explore South America and evade obstacles which appear more life-threatening than they expect.The introduction of the actual villain Charles Muntz in Up comes slightly too late into the film. Because of limited development of the character, Charles is not as imposing as he should be. While it does create an extent of fear, there is not a moment in the film when we have doubts of the protagonists surviving unscathed. Likewise, the climax arrived too quickly as well. Although the adventures of the leads are mostly engaging, they appear short-lived. I see it as a flaw because the filmmakers could have spent more time adding more action set-pieces to the fray.As with Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle (2004), a major influence to this film, physical logic has to be cast aside. Many of the scenes can never happen in reality. Can an old man really navigate a floating house with his frail physique? Can balloons really lift a house? Up tends to indulge in fantasy far more than reality. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but when a film whose devotion to human emotions and bonding (themes grounded in reality) far eclipse that of its far-fetched plot, there is a fair chance that it might turn out to be a mixed bag of unclear priorities. And it does to a small extent. Up is still effective, uplifting, and mostly heartwarming, but it is one of the less accomplished works by Pixar. But that is still saying something.GRADE: B+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",NA
"SPIRITED AWAY","sme_no_densetsu","4 October 2008","In Up, we follow Carl Fredricksen, a widower and retired balloon salesman, who doesn't want his home to be destroyed by the development of commercial buildings, so attaches hundreds of balloons to it and flies it to Paradise Falls, him and his wife's dream destination.Up is great. It's a fun, family film. The story is interesting and very engaging. However, the movie falls into two very obvious sections for me and I will review them as such.The first section is the development of the story, right up to the point they reach Paradise Falls. This section is brilliant. Really great viewing. The beginning flashback sequence with Ellie is absolute perfection. It harkens back to the WALL-E and Ratatouille-esque silent story telling technique. It evokes a real sense of emotion while watching.The second section is where Up loses steam for me. I think the humour becomes overly slapstick and for me, was hit and miss at times. Doug the dog provides comic relief and the ""point"" joke I found funny. However, I felt Russell became very silly. He is obviously an intelligent boy, but some of what he says and does doesn't reflect this.However, in saying all of this, I think Up ends strongly. I really appreciate what how it wraps up and it redeemed some of my earlier grievances.Overall, Up is brilliant. I don't think you're missing out on much if you skip it, but I still think it is worth watching.",NA

Up has to be the most over hyped Pixar movie.First off let me say, the main theme for this film is so good it practically became Pixar's own theme, it's so beautiful.The first 10 minutes are the peak of the film. Lovely, emotional, and surprisingly mature. After those 10 minutes I don't really care for it anymore as it descends into goofiness.I found Russell to be an extremely annoying and unlikeable character, (ironic that I used one of his quotes), but I do also really like where his character ends up.Then we have the dogs, I pretty much despise everything to do with the dogs (Dug especially). I found them used mostly for comedic relief that wasn't needed in the first place, and they serve no larger purpose to the story other than henchmen for the villain.The villain never clicked with me either, his character seemed overly aggressive and evil for no rhyme or reason.And then we have Kevin, who singlehandedly saved this film. Her design and personality was just what this film needed. They should've just used Kevin as the comedic relief instead of the dogs in my opinion.Up very much conflicts me. There are parts in this film that are super beautiful and touching, then we have parts that are overly goofy and unneeded.Up does have a really nice story, (though mostly forgettable), an iconic score, and of course great animation, it's honestly a good movie, but I feel like the stuff I didn't like heavily outweighed the stuff I did like.",NA

I must say thay Elle reminded me of me, red hair and all, so I was predisposed to love it from the start. The animation is glorious. The music is a lullaby for your heart.

"SPIRITED AWAY","poikkeus","24 April 2002","First, I was surprised at the title of this film. In Japan, the title is ""Old Carl and a house which flies in the sky"", so I thought ""Up"" was too short.anyway, the story describes isolation which characters in this film have very well. Carl lost his beloved wife. They have no child, so he starts to live alone. Russell feels a gap between he and his father so he feels lonely. Charles Muntz is a villain of this film, but he is unfortunate circumstance. He was denied his opinion by everyone and people who praised him fell away from him when he was young, so he becomes a person who can't believe anyone bu his dogs. These situation can occur around us, so I think this story is not only fantasy but also human story. Friendship beyond the age and the species impresses viewers. Also the scene which Carl's house flying with colorful balloons in the sky is one of the best part of it.",NA
"SPIRITED AWAY","Laserwolf65","9 June 2010","After the first 15 minutes of Peter Docter and Bob Peterson's ""Up"", I was in tears. I kept thinking this does not bode well for me. In those 15 minutes without much dialogue, the miraculous storytelling of Docter, Peterson, and Thomas McCarthy realizes such heart felt poignancy. We see the life of widower Carl Fredricksen and his wife Ellie up until the present. Carl (brilliantly voiced by Ed Asner) is a lonely old man, who believes the best part of his life has passed him. In ""Up"" Carl was supposed to go on Ellie's dream trip to Paradise Falls in South America, but this does not happen. Instead of surrendering to a retirement home, Carl decides to go on the trip to Paradise Falls by hooking up a fleet of balloons to his house. In the process Carl inadvertently high jacks spirited Wilderness Explorer Scout Russell (wonderful Jordan Nagai). Thus, the adventure begins.""Up"" is the best movie of the year. The animation is visually astounding. Whether we watch Carl's house navigate through the clouds and horrendous storms, or Russell befriending the giant brightly colored mythological bird in the deepest jungles of South America, whom he names ""Kevin"". As it turns out Kevin is actually a she. The Paradise Falls themselves are amazingly beautiful. I can even be with the more out there narrative elements like dogs talking through electronic collar translators, because it is absurd context. I loved dog Dug (playfully voiced by Bob Peterson), who initially finds Carl and Russell. Turns out, the dogs' owner is famed explorer Charles Muntz (sublimely evil Christopher Plummer), who is also searching for ""Kevin"" in an attempt to reinvent his ridiculed legacy.At the heart of ""Up"" is Carl and Russell. Directors Docter and Peterson create a magical chemistry. At first Russell occurs as an annoying Explorer scout in search of his last merit badge—by helping elderly Carl. Carl is this cantankerous old man, who seems to be waiting out the rest of his life. Throughout he keeps calling to ""Ellie"" in lieu of speaking to real people—other than Russell. In a hysterical exchange Carl suggests playing a game: Who can go the longest without saying anything? Excited Russell says, ""Cool! My Mom loves that game!"" However, there is more to Russell than blinding eagerness. While struggling to pitch his tent, Carl inquires why Russell's Dad didn't teach him. Russell replies that his Dad was a great camper, but he didn't get to teach him. Later in the beautiful moment of ""Up"", Carl looks through Ellie's photo album. Sitting in his chair he mouths, ""Cross my heart"" Again, I was in tears. ""Up"" is all eloquence and heart. Docter and Peterson brilliantly balance the hysterical and the touching.""Up"" is all about the wonder and beauty of life. You wonder how Docter and Peterson can circle back and conclude the story. They do, and the fade away scene is as poignant and sweet as anything you will experience. ""Up"" is beautiful and amazing.",NA
"SPIRITED AWAY","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","9 November 2009","Coming off last year's hit Wall-E, Pixar attempts to sweep the hearts (and pockets) of moviegoers with Up. I had the privilege of seeing the film in Philadelphia two weeks before its release. Since Wall-E is in my personal top ten, I couldn't contain my excitement for the excitement Pixar had in store. But I was a bit worried that the premise of a man and his flying home couldn't translate into a feature. So is Up a worthy addition to Pixar's critically acclaimed catalogue?Well, just take a wild guess.Up revolves around 78 year old balloon salesman Carl Fredricksen, who has kept adventure alongside his childhood love Ellie. Meeting as pipsqueaks, the pair shared a lust for escapism and eventually married. Together they had this fantasy of going to Paradise Falls, an elusive world in South America where many wonders lay. But through a somber montage, we see things fall apart and pass away, leaving Carl alone in the house the two rebuilt through their lives.I should mention that Up has many sad (yet endearing) moments, for Carl deals with emotional loss while trying to rekindle his flame of adventure. After the aforementioned montage, one audience member burst into audible tears; I admittedly had to fight some back as well. When you see Carl wishing to be alone and personifying Ellie through their home, you can't help but feel (insert sad adjective).But alas! This *is* a Pixar film, after all. As Carl begins his journey through the skies, we're soon treated to blissful wonder, pure excitement, cunning suspense, and, of course, laughable humor. Pixar is the master of manipulating emotions, and a roller-coaster's worth is packed into 96 minutes.While resting in his buoyant home, Carl receives an unwelcomed addition to his adventure: 8 year old Russell, a Wilderness Explorer (i.e. Boy Scout) who helps Carl for an aiding the elderly merit badge. I originally thought the chipper chubbster would be annoying, catering mainly to the younger audience. However, Russell provides comical relief and has surprising emotional depth.As the characters' journey continues, we discover the pair is more alike than the 70 year difference would suggest. Along their way we meet a rare (and hungry) bird with a sense of humor, dogs who can talk, and many other surprises that I won't spoil. I honestly wasn't bored at all; even during the slower parts Pixar gives us much to admire.Unsurprisingly, Up looks AMAZING. While I didn't see it in 3-D, the 2-D version has plenty to marvel at. Instead of going for realism a la Wall-E, Up tries a more stylized look a la The Incrediblesand succeeds marvelously. I love Carl's squarish head, the vibrant colors, the miniscule details, everything. As a technology junkie, wondering about the programming and rendering used to make the film made my head spin. Things like the scripted physics behind Carl's balloons or the global light reflecting off Russell's chocolate bar were enough to give me a nerdgasm.The sound is fantastic as well. Again, Pixar gives us a great original theme which is mostly played on piano. It's sparse in emotional parts, loud and boisterous in action scenes. Edward Asner does an exceptional job voicing Mr. Fredricksen. All the technical aspects are what we've come to expect from Pixarwhich basically means they're perfect.However, I don't think Up is perfect overall. Granted, this is a film about a man who attaches balloons to his house and flies away, but there were moments that made me question certain choices or actions despite Up's fantastical setting. Furthermore, the central villain was a bit weak (not on a moral scale, though) and quickly came into play with little buildup. Though these seem a bit nitpicky, I was brought of the film at a few points and questioned certain things after the movie finished.Yet these complaints aren't deterring me from jumping on line and putting on 3-D glasses when Up is released. While it's no Wall-E in my book, Up is a film that will take your emotions up, up, and away. It's about loss, love, and realizing the destination isn't what necessarily matters; the adventure getting there is sometimes the most important thing. So take a seat beside me when Up is releasedbut could you get me some tissues this time? Oh, and while you're over there, you might as well grab that Oscar too.9.2 / 10, rounded up for Pixar's hard work through 10 films",NA
"SPIRITED AWAY","Bing5253","31 July 2006","""Up"" opens with a remarkable sequence that tells much of a man's life story with minimal dialogue. I've never seen anything quite like it in an animated movie. The closest I can think of is silent film, which also used minimal dialogue. I was very impressed, even as I was watching, to see how much the animators were able to convey, and the depth of the material. A couple of very challenging life events are addressed, in ways so graceful and subtle that one could not take offense or decide that the subject matter was inappropriate for a children's film or an animated film. I was fully engaged for this sequence, and ready for more. The opening is capped by a lovely, colorful, effervescent scene depicting a house taking flight. After that, the movie was still good, but it didn't engage me as much.",NA
"SPIRITED AWAY","Stampsfightclub","24 January 2010","Up (2009)**** (out of 4) A marvelous achievement ranks as one of the greatest animated movies ever made. The story is pretty simple as an elderly man, after the death of his beloved wife, decides to finally explore South America as the two had always planned. He ties millions of balloon onto his house and takes flight when he notices a young cub scout is along for the ride. Once they hit the jungles the two will discover what's really important in life as they have one battle after another. Even though I had heard this was a great film, I was really shocked to see just how great it actually was. I was a little skeptical after being somewhat letdown by WALL-E, a film I liked but one I didn't feel lived up to the hype. Everything in this film hits all the right marks and I'd go even further by saying it's one of the greatest animated movies I've ever seen. This movie not only has a great love story but it's also an excellent adventure film and buddy film. Not to mention all the great laughs and the masterpiece animation. The Carl character is without question one of the most memorable, lovable and just downright entertaining in the history of animation and I can't help but think that this character will go down in movie history like so many of the early Disney characters. The love story told early on between he and his wife was incredibly touching and more human than many of the live action love stories we get today. His then father-son relationship with the young boy is also incredibly touching as is his connections to that silly bird and talking dog. I really loved the look of the film and those balloons flying are certainly a beautiful site. I'm not a major fan of CG animation but the work being done by Pixar is something truly remarkable and that brilliant work continues here. This is certainly a movie that has a little bit of everything but what's so special is its heart and how it can communicate human emotions through animation.",NA
"SPIRITED AWAY","alexduffy2000","27 August 2003","I immediately fell for this film. I think my favorite moment in the whole thing is when he meets Ellie for the first time. She is one of a kind and the animators did a lovely job of making her eternally beautiful. It has one of the most touching moments I've seen in any film. Then, of course, we need to suspend out disbelief, thinking that a house, propelled by helium balloons, can be raised from the ground, becoming airborne. What follows is a truly great story. We have a young Wilderness Scout who has all the hangups of modern youth, clueless in so many ways. We have a cast of incredible dogs who have been given the ability to speak through a device invented by the villain of the movie. There are complex relationships that transcend the usual kid plots. This one works to the end. Some people ask too many questions. While this movie is about science, we should not read too much into it. Just suffice it to say, it is full of adventure, close calls, bonding, and, of course, true love. I really believe this is one of the better films of this past year.",NA
"SPIRITED AWAY","sweavo","26 September 2003","If someone were to ask me what qualities would make up a great film, I would sum it up with these 4 things:
1) Pretty good atmosphere
2) Well-written non-obnoxious humour
3) A marvellous plot
4) Excellent and likeable main characters who grow effectively during the course of the film
Having watched this film three times, I can sincerely say that Up includes all four of these things. The Incredibles (2004) also contains all four.The montage of Carl and Ellie growing old together is without dialogue and will probably bore some kids. However looking back on it I consider it the most moving opening to a pixar film ever. Being without dialogue makes it more moving and it's symbolic of Pixar's awesome animation.I shed a couple of tears at the scene when Carl sits alone at the funeral. Life is full of happiness and downsides - the animators beautifully depicted that here.The backstory to why Carl wants to go to Paradise Falls is well-told. Ed Asner's acting when Carl and Russell arrive is just so satisfying. Also, I like that Russell is a character in his own right. He's somebody who's likeable and holds his own wishes.The plot is engaging and moving. The climax to the film ties everything together nicely.The music is fabulous as well. While the 7 minutes of story before Paradise Falls drag a bit, it doesn't stop the film getting a 10.",NA

I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about it, everybody else has already done that. A fun adventure, some good comedy, and a surprising amount of heart. Never in a million years did I expect to be as moved by an animated fun movie like this as I was. Yes, there were a few nits I could pick on, mostly involving the villain, but they are easily overlooked given all that I liked about the movie.The problem with writing review for films I love (which I don't do very often) is that I never want to say too much, lest I give anything away. Better to just go see it yourself. But be warned: it's not all sunshine and light, there's some definite sadness in there as well.Out of curiosity, I read some of the ""Hated It"" reviews to see what people there would have to say. Very interesting. The main complaint seemed to be from parents who found it too heavy for their kids. Perhaps that's a valid complaint, I don't know, I'm not a parent. But it raises the interesting thesis that perhaps I, as an adult, responded to the movie so strongly precisely because it is a more adult film than your typical children's-fare animated movie.

But since so many people tries to shove it in my face to watch it, I decided to give it a try...Even though I was sceptical as I began to watch it, I thought the beginning was pretty good... until they made a montage about their life. That was just stupid. I thought it would be so much more interesting to have a story about the love between those two, how it developed (but I know it wouldn't be about that, but still). The more I saw of the movie, the more I did not like it. It felt cheesy, and used a lot of annoying movie clichés. Kid follows old man even though he tries to get rid of him, the main person's child icon turns out to be evil, the characters manages to get out of unbelievably difficult situations out of pure luck, old man hates his followers and wants them to leave him but he gets attached to them near the end... there's just tons and tons of stupid clichés I can't stand. The movie doesn't even try to be original. But the worst thing of all, was the dumb, dumb ending before we see what happens to the old man and the boy. I am talking about after the house disappears, we see it has landed RIGHT EXACTLY IN THE PERFECT SPOT from the painting, and the camera zooms out to calm dramatic ending music... this moment was so cheesy, so utterly stupid, I felt like I was going to puke. No, really; I felt it coming down my throat. I found it THAT stupid. I admit, it WAS sort of entertaining. But it's way too serious for kids, and way too cheesy for adults.

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","zetes","7 November 1999","Princess Mononoke is, without a doubt, one of the best films I have ever witnessed. There has never been an animated film even close to this -- I kept thinking after I left the theater, how can Disney even have the guts to make another film after seeing this? Even live action movies pale in comparison to Princess Mononoke. There has never been a film to pay such close attention to details. Watch for the magnificent and subtle flying insects throughout the film, especially in the ancient forest, where bioluminescent dragonflies glide gently around the screen. There are thousands of subtleties such as this. You'd have to see it a dozen times to appreciate this film fully. Aside from it being the most beautiful film I've ever seen, it also has an enormously powerful script. The characters are some of the the most well rounded in all film. Ashitaka especially, the main character of the film, is so nuanced that he has become in my mind one of the great characters in film, up there with Charles Foster Kane and Jake LaMotta. I would compare him to Freder, the main character of Fritz Lang's Metropolis. His role in the film is a mediator between the forces of humans and the gods of nature. Both sides comment several times that Ashitaka must be on the other side, when he is trying desperately to convince everyone that there are no sides. Peace is the way. There is a little to be desired in the American voice talent. Claire Daines was certainly a wrong choice for San (Princess Mononoke), and Billy Bob Thornton just could not hide his southern accent, which made the character of Jigo seem more comical than he was probably supposed to be. Gillian Anderson's voice clashed with her character, the wolf god Moro, a bit. It hardly affected my passion. The film was so spectacular and beautiful that James Earl Jones could have voiced San and it would have detracted little. Definitely, though, I'm praying that they release the DVD with subtitle options. Anyway, Princess Mononoke is the best film of 1999, the best film of the 1990's, and, in my personal top ten list, no lower than #5, but closer to #2. 12 hours later and my heart is still beating with the power of Princess Mononoke!

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","TanjBennett","15 April 2003","This seems to be Miyazake's most personal work, clearly a serious design. It is set in an imaginary time which blends the time of the ancient gods (Shinto style, gods of place and nature) with the settlement of humans and the coming of metalworking and war.  The world is not in balance, and a distant conflict between industry and nature has wounded one of the gods of the forest, which is then killed by a sentry boy as it rampages into farmland he guards.  The evil controlling it transfers to him, beginning a slow takeover, and he must journey to the origin of the conflict to find a way to cure himself and incidentally, as he will learn, to try to restore balance.  But this is not a simplistic tale, he finds there are other characters in play, and there is good and evil in everyone, and no easy balance.  The Princess (Hime) of the story is a mysterious human who has been raised by wolves (which are themselves powerful forest gods, a little reminiscent of the Amerindian Coyote myth), who becomes both his ally and his enemy.  The story is not easy to understand.  It has many Japanese mythic elements but even then, it is a work of Miyazake's unique imagination, and is not intended to be simple or to have a clean resolution.The animation is spectacular, and unusual, with new elements even for Miyazake and marks a new departure for style which you can see continued in his next film, Sen to Chihiro - more nature, more wild, more jamming on elements from Japanese myth and folklore.  And, continuing the trend to be more personal, concerned with ethics and character, and less sci-fi. There are at least half a dozen well developed characters threaded through the story, and their animation is wonderful in displaying subtle character.The original Japanese soundtrack has some amazing singing and draws upon some of the best talent available for voices - in Japan, Miyazake is universally known and this was a masterpiece carefully crafted.  Japanese television documented a lot of the production.  The English translation drew on some good talent but they seem not to have ""gotten it"" quite so intensely as the Japanese crew.If you haven't seen Miyazake, give it a try (but maybe look at Sen to Chihiro first, or even Laputa or Kiki's Delivery Service, for easier and lighter introduction to his work).  Some say he is the Japanese Disney, but I don't like that.  His work has a depth and sophistication that goes beyond Disney cute.  There is no other animation like it.  This is truly an adult work: children might like some of the visuals, but I doubt that many kids below teen age will have any idea what it is all about, and even adults will get more out of this each time you see it again.","

I will say I am probably biased, as I am a huge Studio Ghibli fan, and love all of their films, I even like Cat Returns, which along with PomPoko is considered as one of the weaker Ghibli efforts. The animation in Princess Mononoke is absolutely stunning, with rich detailed backgrounds and brilliant character animation. The image of the Stag actually made my jaw drop. The music is fantastic as well, and although environmentalism is a subject matter very difficult to get right, what the filmmakers succeeded in doing was making a highly intriguing story that was not only original but succeeded in not being preachy at all. The film is also helped by the high calibre vocal talents of Minnie Driver, Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton et al (voicing quite remarkable characters) and a strong script. True, some of the images like the Demon Worm, may frighten younger viewers, but it is fair to say they were very powerful. All in all, Princess Mononoke is breathtaking and I recommend it highly. 10/10 Bethany Cox","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","JTurner82","20 March 2005","In its theatrical Japanese release of 1997, PRINCESS MONONOKE was the hugest box office grossing movie of all time in the land of the Rising Sun until it was overtaken by James Cameron's TITANIC, and, four years later, director Hayao Miyazaki's own SPIRITED AWAY. No wonder. This movie, like an earlier project of Miyazaki's, NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND, explores man's relationship with nature, hatred causing destruction, and, more importantly, real characters (in other words, no real ""hero"" or ""villain"") trying to get by in a world continually torn by war.This is not a movie for young children, as there are disturbing shots of decapitations, amputations, and occasional blood spurts. Sometimes these elements of violence turn squeamish viewers away from Anime (especially when they're done gratuitously), but Hayao Miyazaki presents it not to sicken people but to show it for the horror that it is (plus, in this film, the violence is not overdone). Take, for example, the scene where the protagonist, Prince Ashitaka of the Emishi Tribe, possessed by a curse he received from killing a Demon God (in trying to protect his village), tries to stop samurai attacking innocent people, and in doing so shoots the arms off of one man, and, later, takes off a man's head with two arrows. The sight is horrifying to see, but the deed also increases Ashitaka's demon mark on his arm, which is slowly preparing to take his life. This is a truly horrible depiction about the dangers of violence.Also worth noting is Princess Mononoke herself, a human girl named San raised by the Animal Gods, and her struggle against Lady Eboshi of Iron Town, who is destroying the forest merely for her people's own good (the folks are outcasts, including lepers and prostitutes). San distrusts and despises all humans, and is especially determined to destroy them all (particularly Eboshi)... or die trying. When she's rescued by Ashitaka, however, a conflict within her begins to surface: are *all* humans evil, or is there at least one who is trustworthy? If there is any character who could be considered a villain, it would be the monk, Jigo, who wants the head of the Spirit of the Forest to bring to the Emperor. Such a deed would destroy the entire forest (as we find out in the film's chilling climactic scenes) but even Jigo has his own motives, too. He is not so much evil as much as he is just ""trying to get by"". This pretty much sums up the conflicts between all our characters here.PRINCESS MONONOKE may not have enjoyed similar box office success here in America, but at least a lot of work and care went into the translation. As with Disney's other English language tracks for Miyazaki's films, this one is very, very well done. Acclaimed writer Neil Gaiman worked on the script, rewording it only to a) fit the mouth flaps, and b) make it understandable to a non-Japanese audience who would probably not comprehend a lot of the cultural nuances found in this film. Added to which, the voice cast includes a commendable list of stars; Billy Crudup is perfect as Ashitaka, eliciting just the right amount of warmth, kindness, compassion, wisdom, and courage, while Claire Danes delivers passionately angry, conflicted turmoil to San. (Folks said she was miscast, but I beg to differ; her character is *required* to be outraged and aggressive, and Danes does have a strong voice to carry such emotions.) The rest of the cast includes Billy Bob Thornton as Jigo (a grossly underrated performance; his Southern drawl adds to the character), Minnie Driver (elegant choice!) as Lady Eboshi, Gillian Anderson as the Wolf-Goddess Moro, and Jada Pinkett-Smith as the friendly (if no-nonsense style) worker Toki. The translation flows smoothly to those who are not familiar with Japanese folk tales, and the story succeeds in making its point, too.This movie may not be for everybody, as it is the kind of film that may disturb young children, but older audiences will find themselves absorbed in the artwork, which showcases gorgeous, unmatched imagination, from the finely detailed forests to the cute little Tree Spirits who appear and disappear at will to the Forest Spirit itself -- a huge deer who makes plants grow with each step he takes. And at night he becomes a ghostly specter known as the Nightwalker, traveling higher than the trees. Such images warrant the purchase of this film. Better yet, its message is not too preachy, and rarely do animated movies (save those from Japan) showcase characters portrayed as, well, human beings.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","misty6767","14 August 2004","The first time I saw Princess Mononoke I was completely moved and surprised. Since it was a Studio Ghibli film dubbed by Disney I liked the fact that it wasn't a ""they all lived naively ever after"" film. There were no complete ""good"" or ""bad"" guys. Even Lady Eboshi the most antagonist character in the movie had a reasonable motive for trying to get rid of the animal gods and cutting down the forest. Although it her actions were environmentally damaging and wrong in general, she did it to help her people survive which is what all the species on Earth strive for. Another wonderful aspect of the plot is that it sends a message - Protect the Earth and all will survive in peace - a message either discreetly or strongly portrayed in many of Miyazaki's films. Perhaps the portrayal of this message (and the tiny hint of San and Ashitaka's romance and Moro's views on nature) was what made the film so touching to me.Like many Miyazaki movies, the animation (as always) is wonderful and nicely detailed which is also another quality that genuine Disney films lack (thank goodness for Studio Ghibli). The music was beautiful and well suited to the movie.The only predicament to the movie is that it is a bit downbeat and does not contain much happy laughter (oh well, I can watch My Neighbor Totoro - also a good movie - for happy laughter.).10/10 - And my favourite movie of all time.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","morphion2","7 January 2006","Studio Ghibli has been Japan's leading anime Production Company since the 1980's, when legendary anime director Hayao Miyazaki released his first feature film ""Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind"" (1984). From the very beginning, it was clear that the Japanese director had a fantastic flair for animated film, and the uncanny ability to engross his audiences beyond the normal movie-experience that makes him the King of Escapism. Over ten years later, it seems that Miyazaki is still just as good, if not better, as he invites the world into his latest visionary fantasy, the cult classic ""Princess Mononoke"".The film is set in Japan, during the Muromachi Era, and begins in the quiet peaceful township of the Emishi tribe, when young Prince Ashitaka (Yôji Matsuda), the last of the Emishi royalty, is wounded slaying a demon in an unexpected attack. When the tribe's wise-woman tells Ashitaka that the wound is a curse of hatred that will eventually kill him, he sets out on a journey to the west to discover the origins of the demon. What he finds is a war being waged between the villagers of Iron town, an industrious Iron-works fort led by the ruthless Lady Eboshi (Yûko Tanaka), and the beasts of the forest, represented by the beautiful Princess Mononoke (Yuriko Ishida), a human girl raised by wolves, with whom the cursed prince falls in love. Soon Ashitaka's efforts to make peace are put to the test by each side's bid for allegiance.""Princess Mononoke"" is a fantastic work of art on many fronts, and arguably Miyazaki's best film to date. While some of his other projects have had the same enchantment and excitement, ""Mononoke"" has an intriguingly dark and infinitely more mature feel, established by the bloody battle-scenes and sensitive color treatment, and solidified by a complex plot and rich, interesting characters. The most obvious illustrative trait of the film is the ambiguity of the characters' nature; the lack of distinction between good and bad. The ruthless lady Eboshi, while caring nothing for the forest or its inhabitants, is very compassionate towards the underdogs of her own community, such as the brothel girls and the lepers. And the wild wolf-princess, while desperate to defend her fellow forest-dwellers and protect the forest spirit, has a deep-seated mistrust of humans that even steeps into self-loathing at times. These interesting character traits make the film a lot more rewarding than many of Ghibli's other works, which were aimed mostly at children.Of course, all these intriguing themes and characters are only a part of the film's wonder, because Miyazaki's true gift lies in imagery. The detailed animation of ""Princess Mononoke"" is astounding, drawing its audience into its environments, from lush forest to open fields to crowded marketplace and more; the team of animators that poured their hearts and souls into this film should take utmost pride in their accomplishments. Using minimal and tasteful CGI, the movie stays very warm and inviting even when the subject matter and mood is less-than-friendly. This is also owed to the audio aspects of the picture; the voice talents involved are highly engaging and enjoyable, even in the English dubbed version, which features such big western names as Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, Billy Crudup, Clare Danes and Gillian Anderson. Joe Hisaishi's music is also a rather splendid complement to the film.Overwhelming success of the anime production in Japan alone stands as a testament to its fine quality. Breaking a 15 year record held by Spielberg's ""E.T."", ""Princess Mononoke"" became Japan's No. 1 movie of all time in the year of its release, as well as taking the title of best-selling video/DVD of all time. It is also the most expensive animated Japanese feature in history, reaching a budget of 2.4 billion. Outside of its home-country, however, the film continues to inspire and engage audiences from all corners of the globe, taking a well-deserved place in the list of cult-favorites for film-lovers everywhere.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Rectangular_businessman","12 June 2010","Ever since I was a kid, I was fascinated by animation, I watched way too many cartoons and would often drawn them myself. I never thought of animation as ""real art"" or anything fancy, just one of life's simple pleasures. Sure Disney had made some ground-breaking animated features, and technology was allowing for more and more detailed and intricate animation techniques, but no animated film had ever moved me as much as a Godfather or Unforgiven or Dr. Strangelove, that is until one fine day in 1999. I was in high school, and Princess Mononoke was premiering at the Coolidge Theater in Brookline, I was pumped as I really enjoyed Castle in the Sky and Totoro, so I went to the theater with a few friends and was absolutely clown away for this. This film is so spectacular in almost every way and every piece comes together perfectly. The animation is top-notch, not that shoddy 1980's anime style, but the mind-blowing animation techniques that made Miyazaki the maestro his is today. The score by Joe Hisaishi is tremendous, though at times it may seem a bit overly dramatic (I mean this is an animated feature, not Lawrence of Arabia), but this is the ultimate animated epic, so it fits in well. The plot is dense and the characters are well-developed, there are no true ""good"" or ""bad"" guys in this film...and Miyazaki includes his favorite underlying theme of Man vs. Nature throughout. Some may argue that Spirited Away was Miyazaki's crowning achievement, but I believe that Mononoke Hime is his true Masterpiece.","

I had read quite a bit about this film and its director but was still totally overwhelmed by the beauty and brutality of this movie.  The complexity of this movie is something never seen in the United States in an animated movie and even exceeds that of most live action movies as well.  It combines love and hate, war and romance, nobility and deception in ways rarely seen in movies today.  Lines of good and evil are anything but clear cut and in the end is hope but no guarantees, no promises.  This is truly an adult movie but my children, ages 12 to 15 all loved it and talked about it for days later.  Even my wife who holds a strong prejudice against Japanese animation enjoyed this movie.Go and see this movie.  You won't be disappointed.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Quinoa1984","11 June 2006","Some might watch Princess Mononoke and find ambiguity at times. It's goes beyond formula into something that challenged me, the interplay between the forces of nature where sometimes the seemingly 'good' side is not what it seems, until the bigger, darker picture comes into view. It's a purely imaginative effort, with a level of dramatic- more over cinematic- power that I'd compare with Kurosawa on a level. Princess Mononoke, in its uncompromising way, details the violence without pulling away while also being rather anti-violent in the process. It is also hard to pinpoint on any one level. Visually it's got so much going on to practically experience the abstractions that Hayao Miyazaki folds up into the rest of the story. The story itself trails along with the best of epic fantasy, with this crucial, earth-shattering quest that works on that level of action-adventure (possibly more for adults despite the PG-13 rating here in the States) as well as the mythological side of things. Some have written that it is a bit of a complex film in structure and storytelling, bordering on confusing. I would disagree, though I can see what they mean- you have to pay closer attention than usual of more American films. But on a more profound level, if one could call it such, it's really not hard to follow.The hero of the film, interesting enough, is the type of tragic hero, though with one clear sight amid the chaos on the two sides he encounters- peace. He is cursed by a sort of wormy-jelly demon that runs unyielding in the darker recesses of the world. He searches for something to rid him of his scars while on the human side at some points (mostly dominated by the women impressed- or against- his skills), and with those of the wolves on the other side. The title character is part of the latter, though also human, bringing a little more of the underlying symbolism with a character. Then there are also the boars ready to destroy the humans, even to their demise. Amid the battles that rage on, leading to the significance of a certain 'Deer God' as the centerpiece of the balance of the forests and civilizations, not too much is made explicit. At the same time, the side taken by the cursed hero is even questioned by one character, and with that part connected with the others the story trumps what could have been a kind of smothering over-symbolic representation into what is necessary and spectacular about the film.In fact, I would estimate on just the near bravery of what Miyazaki is achieving in the film, it's one of the best films of its kind. And 'of its kind' in this case is the animated film that breaks conventions and the typical 'good vs. evil' logic. Many times the suddenness of things had me wide-eyed, and each creature or little variance on the creations- both good and evil- are elaborated with out compromise. The digitally-animated worm-Jelly type monsters are some of the more memorable ones, to be sure, as they book-end the picture in different extraordinary ways (the climax in particular probably ranks with the best of the last decade or so). The tiny bobble-headed alien creatures are also a delight as they rattle and gather and multiply and flee all around; this is the kind of scene that is dream-like to a truly weird and bright sensibility. And many scenes that have more of that samurai-movie quality to them (again, Kurosawa) are extremely well-done on their own as then they become mixed around again with the fantasy elements.To say that the film is really a 'family' film might be not entirely accurate, as some of the battle and attack footage is pretty graphic in its own ways, if not as much as other more adult anime like Fist of the North Star or Ninja Scroll. There are even moments I would say that, had I been little and watching some of the more twisted and macabre scenes, I might have cried from it. But this is a credit to Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli; for older kids this could mark as something that is, indeed, foreign to their expectations, at least American ones. It is a work of art, not just animation, that takes chances and isn't afraid to go for the right twists and leaps of creation and at the same time keeping its message noticeable but not overbearing. It's a film I can't wait to see again, and likely my favorite of the filmmaker's too, with the same cinematic drive as in the other works I've seen but reaching the ambitious heights it intends.","

Studio Ghibli is just nonstop in terms of their animated quality (leaving most animated studios in the dust) even in times like the 90s when this film was released. The action sequences are crafted with such care and such brutality that it's hard not to be remarkably energized by them. The characters surrounding the movie are so engaging and iconic which immensely supports a deeply fleshed-out and powerfully thought-provoking story. Princess Mononoke is a breathtakingly painted tale of a man on a quest to balance two opposite ends of a war filled with hatred, greed, and violence. The conflict of siding between two teams is quite apparent in the film, and it's resolutions are as beautiful as they are significantly important in the real world throughout human history and especially today.

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Boba_Fett1138","3 July 2012","You really don't have to be into anime to appreciate some of the movies that the genre has to offer. Some of them are being simply so good and captivating that basically everybody should be able to get grabbed by it. And I feel that this is one of those movies, that is being a great blend of adventure and fairytale elements.It's really a movie that speaks to your imagination. It's set in a fantasy world, that still feels and looks a lot like our world and the movie is literally loaded with some great and impressive looking fantasy creatures, with the one even bigger and more amazing than the other. In essence this is a mankind versus nature type of movie, in which nature does a lot of fighting back! I can definitely see how ""Avatar"" got 'inspired' by this movie and it features some similar themes and at times also a similar type of atmosphere in it. And I should say though that I liked this movie far better than ""Avatar""! The themes worked out better and were overall more effective and as a whole the story of this movie worked out more pleasantly.I should admit though that the movie can get quite hard to follow at times, will all of its things that are happening and characters that are in it. But this is a 'problem' I have with basically every anime and it very rarely ever ruins the movie experience for me, so it's no complaint or problem really. The movie has some great strong characters in it that can hold their own, amidst all of the great and powerful looking creatures in this movie. And there really are a whole bunch of characters in this movie but this never becomes anything distracting and the movie also never looses its focus. All thanks to some great storytelling skills of course, by Hayao Miyazaki.The animations are absolutely great looking and help to give the movie a great and effective fantasy atmosphere. What I also like about it is that's being such an easy thing to exaggerated things when your animation it, especially all of the action but everything in this movie feels 'real' and doesn't goes over-the-top with things, despite the presence of lots of fantasy elements and characters in it.Another thing worth mentioning is the musical score by Joe Hisaishi. Some great stuff!Whether you like anime or not, this is a great fantasy-adventure movie for everybody, everywhere!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.nl/","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","seamas","11 January 1999","I saw this film in Japan, in Japanese with no sub-titles, I don't speak a word of the language and I was still enthralled!  It is Miyazaki most visually intense (surpassing, at long last, Nausicaa) and is alive with color and movement the like not yet seen in anime.The story is complex, and after talking with Japanese friends, it is clear that much of it went over my head (particularly that relating to specific Japanese myths), but the important elements came through. Miyazaki's long infatuation with technology verses nature and man's relation to God (or gods) weave throughout the film as does his trend for strong women characters. Even with the language barrier, the film is of such intense emotion that it caries you through to the end. The change in dynamic between the crashing fight scenes and the quiet scenes of healing by the lake is so broad and so well paced that I can't remember a film where my emotional state was so expertly varied.If you have a chance to see this film, in any language, I recommend you do.","

Since then I became a huge fan of Studio Ghibli and watched nearly everything they have produced. But still 'Princess Mononoke' stands out to me as their best work and to me is Hayao Miyazakis masterpiece. The topic of this movie is just as simple as complex. It's the fight between human culture coming with the technologic industry versus the nature and its variety of animals living in it and to this day it's a pretty relevant topic. The way both sides are portraied in this movie is just beautiful. Miyazaki manages to show both sides with all their strength and weaknesses. There's no good side or bad side. Instead every side can be understood by the viewer and even if you don't agree with their opinions you still are able to see why each side acts like they do. The visual work is top notch like always with Studio Ghibli. I love how they create a feeling for nature as one whole organism. I really recommend everyone to go watch this movie. To me this is one of the best movies ever created.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","TheMovieDiorama","28 February 2018","I've found it, I've finally found it. Studio Ghibli's magnum opus. The greatest anime feature film I've ever seen. Possibly the best fantasy film I've seen as well. This, this is absolutely incredible. Flawless. The story involves a young warrior who is injured with a supernatural curse. He leaves his remote village in search of a remedy but is caught in the midst of a battle between humans and divine beasts. Depicting the clash between the natural ecological system and the modern urbanisation of mankind. Two opposing ideals and environments that struggle to cohabit in unison. An important environmental statement: be good to nature and nature will be good to you. A fundamental statement that doesn't at all feel preachy, but yet it's ever so present throughout every artistic scene. Strip away the fantasy elements and you are still left with a poignant plot that consistently engages throughout its runtime. Every scene matters, every scene builds upon each other like a stack of bricks to then culminate for an epic third act. The animation is stunning. A work of art. The imagination and creativity that is portrayed on screen is a wonder to behold, and will appeal to everyone. The English dub was well done, all the voice actors suited their roles. San's voice did take some time for me to warm to, but by the end I was on board. Surprisingly, this is an emotional journey. Towards the end where there are a few deaths, I actually felt saddened. The biggest impact of them all was actually the destruction of the environment, Miyazaki somehow creates a personality out of the forest to which I connected to it on an emotional level. Masterful work, it really is. Also, the musical score was mesmerising. Slight warning, its rated a PG but I think it will too much for younger viewers. Lots of severed limbs and bloody imagery that I'm sure will invoke nightmares. Princess Mononoke is the best Studio Ghibli animation I've seen, it's an epic masterpiece that everyone should watch. For that reason it gets the perfect rating.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","jzappa","24 September 2006","Princess Mononoke is a grand, beautifully animated, heartfelt epic. It's a historical fantasy adventure, it's a melodrama, it's a race against time. Its pace is wonderful, taking us climactically through the all-embracing, outspread scope of the story. It has heart, it has violence, it has visual beauty, it has internal conflict.What I like the most about Princess Mononoke is beyond all of these wonderfully delivered elements of a great movie. It's a movie about compassion and understanding towards animals. Yes, these animals are represented by gargantuan, violent beasts, but the movie is about human headstrong influence vs. animal outlook, sense, and behaviorism. It's about how astonishingly much more acute and attuned an animal's understanding is of the world's natural order than that of a human's.I think Princess Mononoke, while being a beautifully made action-adventure, it's an important film, especially for Miyazaki's younger fans. It's important that they take the message of the film seriously.","

This film cannot match the sheer wonder that I felt when I saw that film but this is still an accomplished film who's story is it's strength and weakness.  The story is a pretty good tale that paints a reasonably good picture of this far off land, although some elements of the plot are a little thinner than I would have liked (namely the samurai).  However it still manages to be engaging despite this - although of course it was never going to be as personal a story as Spirited Away.  The obvious message of peace between man/industry and nature is more than just the usual one; where Lord Of The Rings was very much nature good, iron bad; this film is a lot more balanced and doesn't look at either badly.While this runs in the background everything is fine but, when the film has to tie everything up it doesn't quite manage it.  The ending is strangely very fast in happening and it ends on a morally good solution but one that I found to be emotionally quite unsatisfying.  I must admit that the final 5 minutes left me feeling a little abandoned by the characters.  However other than this the story is pretty exciting and the two hours go by pretty quickly.The characters are interesting but I never managed to really get behind anyone other than Ashitaka.  Eboshi was too unpleasant to relate to while Mononoke herself was too distant despite the occasional times where I felt for her.  Part of this may be down to the voice cast in the US version. In Spirited Away the US cast fitted the film really well, here it is less the cast.  Crudup is, ironically, one of the best voices in the cast.  I say ironically because I couldn't place him in comparison to the more famous cast.  Driver is OK but her character wasn't.  Danes is pretty good and I felt that her character improved due to her good voice work.  Anderson was miscast and her voice simply didn't fit her character at all (even with the echo added).  Thornton was good for the more comedic role but slightly took away from the dramatic impact of the samurai.  Pinkett-Smith brings her attitude to the role well and both she and Keith David are funny.Visually it is as impressive as you would expect from Miyazaki.  It all looks great, the whole land is filled with detail and it flows so freely. The spirits and gods are imaginative and very well drawn and the people show up just how basic stuff like Pokemon really is!  It is a little too gory to be for kids (even though it is rated pg in the UK) but the vast majority of it is as detailed as you wished more kids' animation was.Overall I really enjoyed this film but occasionally found it difficult to get past some of it's weaknesses.  The characters are not all as strong as I would have liked and some of their voices aren't that good.  The ending is a bit of a letdown as I was hoping for a more emotionally satisfying conclusion to the story.  Despite this, it is still a wonderful film and easily one of the best animations I have seen.","

I enjoyed watching the film very much, but the duration of the film was a great negative. The film was sometimes very fast in showing some events and very slow in showing other events. This matter made me feel a little bored, the story of the film was talking about the relationship of man to nature This is an excellent thing, especially since the film is directed to children. This was shown to them. It was an excellent choice by the Ghibli studio. I could not love any character in the film despite my understanding of their goals until I could not get attached to them, the drawing of natural scenes in this film was impressive, I enjoyed very much Watching the movie and I recommend watching it","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","classicsoncall","12 January 2015","A difficult story to follow and decidedly scary animation at times makes this more an adult film than one for younger fans. It's not too hard to follow in the early going but when the hero Ashitaki makes his way East to the land of the Forest Spirit he's faced with choices that put him on questionable sides of relationships already formed. While trying to save his own life endangered by a poisonous encounter with the boar demon Nago, his overriding mission is to 'see with eyes unclouded by hate'. For this he must valiantly strive to understand the motivations and prerogatives of those he meets, including monk Jigo, Lady Eboshi of Irontown and the wolf princess San, a human raised by wolves. In turn, each of these individuals comes to understand that good and evil are not mutually exclusive character traits, but exist in all to varying degrees. The way this all plays out can be confusing and is not made easier by the depiction of characters like Moro, the large threatening white wolf who by design one would consider a male, but in actuality is the mother of San. It's an intricately woven tale and loyal fans of anime will find it spellbinding, though I must admit, for myself it took a concerted effort to follow and understand.","

While I do love it when there is an eco message in the movies (and that's another thing with Studio Ghibli, or rather was, since they retired), it doesn't mean I can't enjoy a silly animated movie too (whatever it may be, Pets, Despicably me and so forth). Having put that out of the way, there are so many things included here, that even if you didn't know it was from Studio Ghibli, they have their way of telling stories, of animating them, of putting characters into them (and into peril). Mostly with a lot of innocence, but also a lot of violence too. They don't shy away from showing certain aspects of life (like death, the circle of life, with blood and all).So if you can bare that, the struggle is real and it is very well made. Tension from start to finish, with quite some ambiguity too ...","

Between ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Spirited Away"", there is much to be seen in the way of Japanese animation beyond the omnipresent anime.Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called Princess Mononoke ""a great achievement and a wonderful experience, and one of the best films of the year.""

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Leofwine_draca","14 January 2011","I'm not a huge fan of anime, so I'm not the best person to review this film. Nonetheless I found myself watching it to find out what all the fuss was about.Initially, I found the film gripping. The old-fashioned animation felt fresh and I loved watching the colourful panoramas play out on screen. The early scenes involving the terrible forest monster chasing the film's hero were vivid and exciting; then Princess Mononoke is introduced.Gradually, I lost interest in the film. I found the story far too slim to support the lengthy running time. Myriad characters are introduced and underdeveloped, and the emphasis seems to be on repetitive action involving the different factions battling each other. Certain sequences are certainly captivating on the animation front - especially the huge, translucent forest god creature - but the story just didn't keep my attention.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","CinemaClown","3 May 2014","This was just... Wow. I'm still mesmerized by the incredibly dense cinematic experience this anime provided from start to finish & I'm still collecting my thoughts on it. Because Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke isn't just one of the strongest feature films put out by the artistic filmmaker or Studio Ghibli as a whole but is a landmark in the world of animation whose quality story, thematic elements & breathtaking on-screen execution makes regular animated flicks look like the works of amateurs.A period drama infused with elements of fantasy & set in early centuries of Japan, Princess Mononoke tells the tale of Ashitaka; a young prince who after saving his village from a rampaging boar-god/demon is stricken by a deadly curse & journeys to the forest of the West looking for an answer, only to find himself involved in the struggle between the supernatural guardians of the forest & the humans who are consuming its resources.The title refers to a young girl who was raised by the wolf-goddess & has a strong hatred for mankind. Written & directed by Hayao Miyazaki, Princess Mononoke is arguably the creative height of his illustrious film career & presents him in complete control of his craftsmanship. The 2D animation is absolutely dazzling, the supernatural creatures as well as forests are vividly imagined, the voice actors have done a fab job & music elegantly moves its story forward.The main theme this film deals with is the effects of industrialization on nature, deforestation & how it affects the species who've inhabited these places long before man's greed laid its eyes on their lands. On an overall scale, Princess Mononoke is an expertly crafted, deftly envisioned, gorgeously photographed, swiftly paced & masterfully composed work of art & entertainment which transcends the confines of animation with its complex story, strong characterization, adult themes & makes its statement heard rousingly clear.A standard of 2D animation, a treasure of world cinema, and arguably the pinnacle of Studio Ghibli's creativity, Princess Mononoke (Mononoke-hime) is strongly, extremely & one hundred percent recommended to each & every film lover around the world.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","crowrobot","15 October 2006","'Princess Mononoke' is, quite frankly, one of the greatest animated films of all time. It's a classic, filled with terrific, eye-popping imagery, complex characters, and it is truly powerful in its dramatic impact. I came close to tears by the film's end.The first thing you will notice about 'Mononoke' is the animation. Animation god Hayao Miyazaki fills his screen with lush colors and bizarre fantasy creatures (personal favorite: Ashitaka's deer/horse steed Yakul). It's a far cry from the increasingly cheap animation we have in America. The movie is ambitious in its scale, and there are some truly magnificent set-pieces, like the near-apocalyptic ending.Also of particular note is the story. These characters and this plot are not black-and-white. Lady Eboshi may be cutting down the forests and angering the gods, but she truly believes it will help her people; she shows compassion to outsiders like lepers and prostitutes, and her regret at Ashitaka's cursed arm is sincere (she did, after all, cause the boar god's madness). San, the ""Princess Mononoke"" of the title, has shades of gray, too: Yes, we sympathize with her desire to protect the forest, but she is not innocent of bloodshed. Even Jigo, a con man/priest who wants the Forest Spirit's head for the Emperor (which is obviously a bad idea), has his reasons for committing what may be considered ""evil"".The English voice cast has divided people, but I liked it. Billy Crudup brings gravity and stoicism to Ashitaka, and Claire Danes is appropriately fierce as San. The standouts, however, lie in the supporting cast. Minnie Driver is perfect as Eboshi, bringing wit and elegance to the role; Gillian Anderson breaks from her Scully persona to deliver a powerful performance as ancient wolf god Moro; Keith David, one of America's most underrated actors, rules as the boar god Okkoto, and Billy Bob Thornton is very funny as Jigo. Thornton's Southern drawl has caused controversy amongst fans, but I think it adds to the character's charm.'Princess Mononoke' is a masterpiece. To find a flaw in this movie is impossible.","

The film is about Nature and humans and the gods of all things. The young boy tracks down Princess Mononoke to help him. The film is beautifully animated and enjoyable. It also has some good insights about the culture and showing the important balance (or imbalance) between humans and Nature. It has some good lessons to learn here. This is a film that can be enjoyed and sets itself above many of the other animations coming out these days. It's serious, yet it is refined; it does have a refined sense of humour in a couple of places. I recommend it.","

Quite an accomplishment. Although a fantasy, it addresses humanity's relationship with the natural world, and also the question of how we define good and bad.Even though this is an animated feature, it's not one for the tykes. Far from the ""cute"" stuff often found in US animated features, this movie depicts war and a number of gruesome scenes (also addressing karma and the loss of innocence). But even so, everything is in the movie for a reason, and it amounts to one fine picture. It's rightfully earned its place among IMDb's top 250 and a spot in Steven Schneider's list of 1,001 movies to see before you die.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","goc6283","3 November 2014","Fun info: This is Miyazaki's first forgo into computer animation, used in the dark ""snakes"" near the beginning and a few other scenes and is also one of his most violent films. It also has a solid English dub.It concentrates on a different type of character than most of his films, a young man, Ashitaka, rather than a young woman. His quest does not change him like in many other films but rather he changes many others. The film leans just enough on environmental issues to show a cause while allowing the graphics and story you desire from a Miyazaki film. Special note to the soundtrack which is one Ghibli's best. It concentrates on an iron-works and the battle between various factions of humans, the beasts, and others.I don't plan on spoiling much else as the films plot speaks for itself. My only complaint is that certain scenes drag a bit too long and if anything a bit too much blood spills at a certain part of the film. Otherwise, this film is excellent and one of his best.9.5/10","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Jeremy-93","11 February 2003","If, like me, your heart sinks at the prospect of another pious, sanctimonious, tub-thumping eco-fable, give ""Mononoke Hime"" a chance all the same. It does have a distinct, and far from subtle, ecological message, of the ""can't we just live together?"" variety, but on the other hand it's far from clear that the answer the film suggests is ""yes"", and there are plenty of nuances and subtleties along the way. More to the point, there's a proper story, well-conceived and well told, there's a memorable, beautiful and violent world, credible characters and a good deal of charm.The animation is mostly very fluent and careful, though not flashy in the way we're getting used to in this CG age. (""Mononoke"" uses cgi, but subtly and with restraint, so that the feel remains that of a group of traditional craftsmen under one guiding hand). Quite often one finds that there are more static elements in a tableaux than you'd expect in a Disney animated feature, but I think this is an aesthetic choice rather than a mere economy: it stylizes and formalizes, while focussing attention on the important elements in the frame. But there is occasional jerkiness, though not enough to detract seriously, and perhaps it wouldn't trouble audiences whose frame of reference isn't so western as mine - I'm not sure.Talking of the western and eastern sensibilities, the Region 2 DVD which I'm reviewing gives you a choice of English and Japanese dialogue, and though I watched the American dub first, I'd generally prefer the Japanese version, for the key roles of Ashitaka and San. Billy Crudup is appealing but too low-key, and Clare Danes strikes me as badly miscast: she sounds a bit too old, and altogether too urban to bring out the core of wildness or the steely sense of loyalty to her world. Like other reviewers, I have trouble with the Texas drawl of Billy Bob Thornton, which is just too regionally specific to match the look of the character (please understand that I'm not suggesting the cast should all have done fake Japanese accents!). On the other hand, it's pretty much a toss-up between Yuko Tanaka and Minnie Driver (who's very closely attuned to the aesthetic of the original) as Eboshi, and Gillian Anderson and Jada Pinkett Smith are just right. Still, overall you get more vividness and conviction from the original voice cast.  Oddly, the lip-sync seems more approximate in the Japanese version, perhaps a fault in the synchronization on the R2 DVD.  The subtitles unfortunately but understandably come from Neil Gaiman's adaptation of the screenplay rather than re-translating the Japanese - one's aware, for example, that Gaiman has added bits of extra, explanatory dialogue.With all that out of the way, let's concentrate on what makes the film work: it delineates a world that's at once mythological and believable, and refuses to sentimentalize or simplify (even if it occasionally allows itself to preach).  There are feuds and failures of trust not just between the humans and the animals, but within each world - and the animals seem as ready as the humans to exclude the other from their world. Indeed the conceit of the film seems to be that language, rather than being a product of distinctly human evolution, was originally shared among mammals at least, and it's as the war with the humans goes on that the animal kingdom becomes more brutish and less coherent. For all the prince's idealism and the delicate rapprochement some of the characters inch towards, one gets the impression that the logic of conflict will be hard to resist.Perhaps the most appealing and intriguing element in this world is the kodoma: the little, voiceless tree-spirits seem to be a cross-between a mushroom, a toddler and a rattle, and I defy anyone not to be captivated by them.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","ElMaruecan82","26 June 2017","I saw ""Princess Mononoke"" twice the same weekend but I'm not sure I grasped half of what makes it such a great movie. Even 'great' is too vague a word; so many 'great' movies are not one-tenth the film ""Princess Mononoke"" in style, content and universal implications. Even after two viewings, I can only provide a superficial overview on the story and a meager but enthusiastic review of what constitutes one of the best animated movies of the last decades. To think that the same year, Disney came up with ""Hercules"" gives you an idea of where the real magic of animation operatedthanks to the most imaginative creator and most accomplished artist of his generation: Hayao Miyazaki. Indeed, imagination and artistry never got along so well since Walt Disney. Now, to the story.Although set in medieval Japan, ""Princess Mononoke"" ventures between the realms of history and fantasy, in a universe where the spirits of a God-like Nature govern the lives of (precisely) all living creatures: animals, plants and even men, they all coexisted in harmony until the age of deforestation. The film opens when a wild demonically possessed creature attacks the village of Ashitaka. And the tone is set from the start: the monster looks like a giant boar recovered by a sort of tentacles looking like writhing snakes, the drawing dwarfs any CGI abomination. You might as well compare a Rembrandt with a 4-year old kid's painting. The film was made in the late 1990's at the dawn of the CGI frenzy and when 3D animation would drive half the box-office grosses, but all the special effects of the world will never hold a candle to the power of hand-painting. ""Princess Mononoke"", the highest-grossing movie in Japan but soon-to-be dethroned by ""Titanic"", required a level of precision that couldn't do without traditional drawing. Miyazaki resorted to computer for a few hundred shots, only 1% of celluloid, but it says something about the man's pragmatism as he could also embrace technology to keep a fair balance between his stylish and narrative visions.And it works. When Ashitaka defeats the monster, everything looks real and the injury resulting from the fight doesn't have the contrivance of a 'magical' plot device. Ashitaka's arm is infected by a mysterious curse that will ultimately cause his death although giving him temporary superpowers (like decapitating someone with his a simple arrow shot). The village's wise woman tells him he must be exiled for his own good, to save his arm with the help of the Gods of the forests. Then starts the heroic and epic journey of the young Prince. From what I read, a few words were mistranslated, he's not actually a Prince and the girl who gives him the talisman isn't his sister, they're actually lovers. It doesn't undermine the comprehension of the story but it shows that the film is impregnated by Japanese culture and some idioms might be lost in translation. Even the title is misleading: Mononeke doesn't refer to the name of the Princess, but her status as a ""possessed monster or outcast"", this description, from human perspective, isn't objective but it reflects her status as someone between two worlds. Her real name is San and she was raised by the Goddess-wolf. San is like a counterpart to Ashitaka, both human protagonists deeply related to the animal world, one by choice and one by fate. While San resents humans for their destructive actions and their effects on animals (we'll learn later that the boar-demon was cursed by a bullet lodged in his body), Ashitaka is a collateral damage of men's actions but he's incapable of hatred, and empathize with both animals' and men's pleas. As usual with Miyazaki, this is not your typical ""good vs. evil"" story. The closest character to a villain is Lady Eboshi, the chief of Irontown, and she cuts trees to make iron and build the fortress where many social outcasts, ex-brothel workers and lepers work in exchange of food and protection. Eboshi has understandable motives and she's also a powerful woman respected by men and therefore, needing to assert her authority. Even the main antagonist, Jiko-bo, a sneaky monk, has a mission: taking the head of the Forest Spirit for the Emperor, he's like a government worker, so to speak. Ashitara is like the centerpiece of an arena where creatures struggle to find peace and harmony; even the Gods Animals are unequally pacific. The environmentalist statements aren't spoken at the expenses of realism. We do root for Nature and accept Miazaki's protection of environment but there's the idea of people defending their own interests, for their own survival. It's not realism, but lucidity. But lucidity doesn't undermine the dazzling visuals: the forest looks majestic, the wolves have that furry amplitude that shows how determined they are, and the magic displayed whether to convey a sense of danger or beauty is hypnotically beautiful. But that's only the tip of the iceberg, there's more to see in the film. Even the romance between San and Ashirata is handled with a sense of maturity that respects the coherence of the plot and our intelligence. ""Princess Mononoke"" surpasses everything Disney made in the last years before and everything Peter Jackson will make, CGI can look fine but you're always tempted to cheat with it, computer does the trick. There was a screen writing manual titled ""Save the Cat!"" and explaining how most movies, especially on the field of animation and fantasy / sci-fi journeys were based on the same structure. I dare anyone to find a usual pattern in ""Princess Mononoke"", this is a film that defies all the conventions and where every frame is original and surprising. To put it simply, ""Princess Mononoke"" is a great animated film with a great story, can you ask for more?","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","beardyfriesen","21 April 2007","A few years ago I would have tossed this film into a collection of movies I like to call the rubbish pile. Recently, however, I have forced myself, with great difficulty, to open my mind and look at the entire picture. Instead of focusing on one or two aspects of the movie I do not like and formulating a biased opinion based on my hasty and clouded notions, I can now decipher both the good and bad points of a given flick. Upon watching Princess Mononoke, I must say I first thought it would be very difficult to look past the animation style and see it for what it was- a dynamic film directed be the highly acclaimed Hayao Miyazaki. After about ten minutes of dwelling on the follies (and there are, in my opinion, many) of the ""anime"" style of art, I became enthralled with the quickly unfolding plot and the subsequently dire fate bestowed upon Ashitaka, the protagonist of the film. After Ashitaka leaves his village to search for a treatment to remedy his affliction, I no longer cared that this was an animated feature; I was on the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next. I no longer disliked that every character had abnormally large eyes (though not over-sized to the point of utter absurdity) or that the English overdubbing was a little choppy. In fact, I even began to enjoy the accomplished yet subtle computer generated effects interspersed throughout. By the last half hour I was hooked to the screen, eagerly awaiting the conclusion I wanted so badly to end the bitter conflict of the plot. By the end, I realized that this movie carried a powerful moral with it: man's continuous tampering with nature brings about as much savagery as it does progress, as much suffering as it does good, and that a sound compromise must be struck between nature and civilization. I do not harbor any negative feelings towards those who rated this movie poorly, as I used to be one of those people. All I have to say to them is this: look at a both the visual and symbolic attributes of a movie before rating it harshly. If, after observing all these features and idiosyncrasies, you still wholeheartedly hate the film, then by all means give it a one. After all, what would the world be like if we were all did not criticize or question our surroundings?","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Spleen","14 June 2001","Disney animation has linear detail, economical drawing, and extremely sophisticated motion.  In a word, it's classical.  Japanese animation has vertical detail, heavily etched backdrops that verge on being overdesigned, but rudimentary motion.  Japanese animation is baroque.  (Disney cartoons tend to have better draftsmanship, but this is inessential to the difference in style.)  The styles could hardly be more fundamentally opposed, and you like either one or the other.  It's hard to have a strong taste for both. To lay my cards on the table, I like the Disney style: I consider it more subtle and versatile, and at its best it lives and breathes like no other kind of animated image.  Still, the Japanese style has its strengths.It's essentially a static art: silence and stillness are what it conveys best.  It's interesting to compare ""Mononoke"" with ""The Emperor's New Groove"".  The latter film is unusual for Disney in that silence and stillness are used with surprising frequency, but the effect is always unstable: stillness is a kind of dissonance, something requiring resolution. The moments of silence and stillness in ""Mononoke"" are consonant and complete in themselves.  There are some lovely static tableaux in which the dialogue - if there is any - has as much time as it needs to breathe.The Japanese style is also good at conveying a sense of place.  (Disney can do this also, but neither as quickly nor as economically.)  Usually it's an urban place.  Think of definitive anime, and most Westerners think of ""Akira"" and ""Ghost in the Shell"", which are very urban indeed.  (My personal favourite in the genre is ""The Crimson Pig"", which, if not quite so urban, is heavily technological.)  ""Mononoke"" is different.  Most of the action takes place in the untamed, and I mean untamed, wilderness; now and then we enter a village.  Surprisingly, even these settings are solidly realised.  A single drop of water falls from a pine tree and lands on someone's face, and at once we feel that we are in the middle of a dense, damp, green forest.The story is deeply weird, in the best Japanese tradition - in particular, in the tradition of this particular director - and intensely sad.  The hero's quest is fulfilled, in a sort of a way, but the film does not end in triumph.  Instead of thinking ""good, X happened"", we think, ""oh well, at least X happened"".  -I must admit I was surprisingly unmoved.  Something about ""Mononoke"" distanced me; it may have been the facelessness of the central hero, it may have been the overall style; if the latter, it may have been entirely my fault, which is why I'm unwilling to commit myself to any kind of criticism.  All I know is that, much as I admired parts of ""Mononoke"", I am unable to love it.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Movie_Muse_Reviews","28 January 2009","No one tells a more imaginative, original story than Hayao Miyazaki. While fantasy is a genre with limitless potential, there's still nothing like one of Miyazaki's animated fairy tales and ""Princess Mononoke"" is one his finest.The story follows a young warrior named Ashitaka who gets bitten and cursed by some sort of forest demon. The wound is surely fatal unless he embarks on a journey to find a cure. In his travels, he stumbles across a town of iron miners who are seemingly at war with wild animals, namely a pack of wolves and their princess, San. Ashitaka must try to play peacemaker as the forest's deer god--who both sides seek out for different reasons--might be his only means of a cure.The animation that brings a world of fantasy but also of feudal Japan to life is excellent. So many of the creatures are transparent, the large demons and gods are drawn of individual organism-like things that all move on their own while also making up a whole. The work must have taken forever. The nature backgrounds are also beautifully drawn. While most of the work and figures are in traditional anime style, the magical creatures will amaze you and the action is particularly well-directed to enhance the visual experience.""Princess Mononoke"" is a film for those who either have an appreciation of anime or more simply, an appreciation for imagination. Miyazaki's deer god sweeping through the land, his forest demons consuming people, Ashitaka's living scar, etc. are all things that simply inspire the imagination in everyone.While the film leaves its biggest impression as just a one-of-a-kind fairytale, there is some definite effort made to show that this battle between the humans and the wild animals is representative of man's struggle with nature. It is a fantastical dramatization of how we often upset the balance and harmony between the two. For people who have been exposed to nothing but Western film with Western ideas, this is quite a refreshing theme rooted in Buddhist philosophy and other Eastern religions, but certainly one all cultures can understand.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Vartiainen","23 November 2014","The magnum opus of director Hayao Miyazaki and one of the if not the best animation movie ever made. A film that children can watch no doubt, but which still deals with the themes of loss, sacrifice, the non-existent line between good and evil, war, death and the dying state of divinity and spirituality. It's a heavy movie, yet it's never so excessively dark and brutal that you couldn't show it to a twelve-year- old.For me, this is one of those perfect movies that you have the honour of coming across every once in a while. Because it's really hard to find any faults in this movie.The animation? Superb, mind-blowing, unbelievably beautiful from the very first shot of mountains covered in mist to the last shot of the great forest reaching for the heavens.The music? Haunting, soul-altering, beautiful beyond believe. The main theme has had a spot on my daily playlist ever since I saw this film.The characters? Magnificent. Detailed, fluidly animated, easily having more depth than most live-action characters ever created. I also love how this movie has no clear bad guys. The clash between the spirits of the forest and the civilization of man is the central focus of the film, but you very quickly realize that neither of those sides is in the wrong. They both have reasons for their actions, for defending what they see as theirs. The methods of both are at the same time commendable and questionable. Name one other movie where you've seen anything similar. I bet you have to think about it for a while.If you had to point fingers and say that those are the bad guys, you probably would go with the bounty hunters. But even they're rather likable as characters and are only doing what they're doing because it's their job. So yeah, not even them.And sure, the movie has flaws. No film has not. The eponymous Mononoke is not all that central to the conflict and is easily the most boring of the main characters. The deer god does look silly. Don't act like he doesn't. Other things like that. But they're all really minor. Nitpicks, if even that. Because the film is just that good.Princess Mononoke renews my hope for life every time I see it. It hasn't lost even a hint of its beauty, splendor and impact over the years. If you're ever going to see only one Japanese animation, see this one. Or Spirited Away.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","tedg","15 June 2001","Spoilers herein.The first thing I want is to be transported. The further the better, the more competently the better. This film transported me. It had quite a bit different take on the world -- heavihanded, confusing, illogical, juvenile mysticism, pop morality -- all different than what we are usually served up. Some of this strangeness (I am convinced) is because the director is a poor storyteller.Disney's ethic was that the simplicity in the art corresponded with a simplicity in the story, so much so that one could turn off the sound and get the story. Not just follow the story but follow the WHOLE story. Anime seems to want to turn that on its head, making the animation simpler than anything out of Disney, but blowing up the story complexity with so many threads that kids believe it is profound.No matter for me, the confusion and pseudodepth was part of the experience.But there is another element here, and that really did disappoint me. 'Akira' was genuinely artistic, not so much in the drawings themselves, but in the understanding of motion. I was impressed with how the edges on the screen corresponded to the edges between scenes. Akira had a similarly childish sense of the complexly profound, but the art showed mastery and self-awareness.The vision in this film is just plain unimaginative in how the motion is handled. I'm not talking about the quality of the animation (which is poor), but the depth of the art. And the images themselves lack imagination: a wormy boar as a demon; the nightwalker was straight out of scoobydoo; the wolfgods?; the smurfy sprites? None of this reaches deep.If you want an introduction to anime and are looking for art, go to 'Akira.' Don't even stop here.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","louis1011","10 July 2018","Princess Mononoke was on may radar for some time before I first saw it. Hearing that it was a 'Miyazaki master piece' but not really knowing what to expect. However as I started to watch the opening of the film I could tell from the amazing musical score and the breathtaking animation that I was watching a truly captivating film. As the story progresses you get a more three dimensional look at the characters in the film looking from all points of view seeing whats everyone wants. In particular you get a good look at the main character Ashitaka(voiced by Billy Crudup) as he tries to stop a conflict between San(voiced by Claire Danes) ,a girl raised by wolves, who is helping lead the wolves and other Forrest creatures up against Lady Eboshi(voiced by Minnie Driver) the Head of a village who are gradually destroying the Forrest for the resources the land has.Compared to other films Princess Mononoke should rank among the best animated films as it have a level of grandness that could only be matched by films like The Lord of the rings. Over the years this film has also been compared with other anime films however this film has a completely different tone to most of them as you don't get a shonin vibe or a high school romance. Overall I think that This one of Miyazaki's best films and probably one of the greatest animated films ever. That's why I'm giving it a 9/10","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","emasterslake","13 March 2005","This movie which is one of Miyazaki's longest and most challenging anime film he's ever done. It's his first PG-13 film. While allot of his other films are PG or sometimes G. The animation and story line is very well made and planned out. I didn't see it in theaters when it came out in the US of 1999. I first heard of it at my Jr. high school, got the DVD of it later on when I learned more of Miyazkai's films. It's one of those films were at first it seem OK, but as you keep watching it it gets better every time it's viewed. Not in my personal favorites but it's definitely a fine piece of work by Miyazaki himself. I advice it to keep it away from younger viewers cause it's very violent. So it's suitable for like 13 and up.I give it 7.5/10","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Sleepin_Dragon","28 January 2023","When I first saw this film in 1997, it was in its original Japanese version, I was blown away by the animation, but found the story a little hard to follow, my second viewing, featured the English voices, and allowed the pieces to come together.The animation, still looks incredibly fresh, twenty six years old, and still wonderfully detailed, bright and packed with detail, better than anything at the time. The music was equally brilliant.I am surprised still that it hasn't been adapted into a live action movie, the story is a truly brilliant one, it's entertaining, moving, exciting, but it doesn't at any point preach at the viewer, it isn't heavy handed, but it does deliver a pretty big message.It's the perfect mix of art and entertainment, a few sequences make me think it's suitable more so for a mature adult, some scenes may be upsetting for younger children.In terms of the voices, I really liked Claire Danes and Gillian Anderson, I was a bit mixed with Billy Bob Thornton's voice, I'm not too sure it worked with his character.Overall, it was excellent.9/10.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Horst_In_Translation","27 June 2022","""Mononoke-hime"" or ""Princess Mononoke"" is a Japanese animated film from 1997, so this one has its 25th anniversary this year. I think this was not or at least not primarily the reason why it was shown again here at a local movie theater, but it was part of a film series with focus on anime. No big surprise because this is (considered) one of the classics. Writer and director is Hayao Miyazaki who is probably associated with anime movies more than anybody else. He was in his mid50s when he made this film and is over 80 now. I see there are quite a few talented American actors attached to this project and they were part of the English-language voice cast of course. This includes talented folks like Billy Bob Thornton, Billy Crudup and Gillian Anderson, but also less talented performers like Claire Danes or the absolutely unbearable Jada Pinkett Smith. Sad to see her as part of this project. I watched the Japanese original with subtitles, so I cannot elaborate in-depth on the international voice cast here, but the Japanese did fine overall. No more details there either because I am simply not familiar with their names. Most likely my loss. At almost two hours and fifteen minutes, this is a very long film for the genre. It could almost have been turned into a miniseries as well with this duration I guess and could have worked as well, no matter if there had been three or six episodes. You will not really find an equally long Studio Ghibli film. The awards recognition for this film was there, but surely less spectacular than it would have been nowadays where without a doubt it would have been one of the big animation players at the Oscars as well as at the Annies. The English-language version did not change anything about that either.One striking aspect about this film here was that it took quite some time until the title character really became a factor in this film, even appeared in this film. We see her briefly on one occasion when the main character runs into her, but there is not really any dialogue, just him screaming something at her and definitely the male protagonist here is more of a central character. But this is no exception when it comes to anime that they name the film after the most crucial female character, even if she does not have as much screen time as her male counterpart. I think it was an alright decision though. The longer the film goes, the more Mononoke moves to the center of it all, even if the guy also never disappears from the action. They are basically fighting together. And they also need each other. There are several situations when they save each other's lives pretty much. When one of them is unconscious. Honestly, I must say that, even if I did not expect a supernatural power warrior, I was a bit baffled by how Mononoke really got in miserable situations again and again, like also when she is trapped by her antagonists on one occasion and the male character helps here there again too and basically carries her out of the village. How did he get both women unconscious though at the same time? Anyway, this was also a bit of a critical situation because he is shot by one of the women from the village and it was a shot that not many would have survived, but he was clearly on a mission. There are some very supernatural aspects in here, but the two main characters are really as human as it gets. The title character may live with wolves in the forest, but she is still nothing but a human. The guy may be a very strong and dedicated fighter, but he is also not a deity or so. But he is able to take one on when he has to as we see at the very start with this really gigantic boar that comes to wreak havoc to his village. He manages to defeat it and we are informed on a few occasions that the boar was possessed by either a demon or an evil god. We even hear this creature's voice at the end when he leaves the corpse. Some very deep and gruesome voices you hear on a few occasions, also for example when other boars are talking or also when wolves are talking.One special thing about the forest is that the creatures living there are all pretty gigantic. At least the wolves and pigs are. Maybe the monkeys too, they are just side characters, but we see through them that the animals inside the forest are also not always getting along well and they have their conflicts that could even turn violent on some occasion, even if they eventually don't. Then there are two deer creatures, the pretty likable pet (if you can call it that) that belongs to the male protagonist and a really big and powerful deer that is the fleshly form (if you wanna call it that) of the forest god. Not a permanent form because he switches back and forth though and we see him also in his other more spirit-like form and we also get to witness the transition. And we get to witness what happens when said deity is attacked by a human tribe and literally loses his head to their aggression. That was a shocking moment. Maybe not the best idea to do that to a god and the consequences are massive as well. How he goes looking for his head and what happens to the forest at the same time. The ending is almost the now you could say. Green everywhere and the God is all over the place, but not really tangible anymore. There were mentions of said god deciding about life and death and I must say I am a bit curious how he did not kill the woman who did this to him. I will get to her in a second. For now, it can also be said that the male protagonist is not soft at all either. He also decapitates two people early on his journey that are about to commit crimes. Then there is the one who gives him advice that he should be careful when people are following him. Seemed like more of a comedic inclusion early on, but he is also a pretty (head)strong character as we find out quickly and somebody you should be very careful with. We understand this when he eventually returns.Now, as for the woman, I mentioned earlier, she was maybe not really less interesting than Mononoke. You could never be sure what was up with her. On several occasions, she seemed grateful towards the protagonist and not afraid to show it in front of her people, on the other she is a violent schemer who wants to conquer the world. She is not scared of killing forest creatures either. Basically, she goes there to kill the sacred deer even, the god of them all. In the end, she is more of a good character again when after her and her people's home got destroyed she says they will rebuild it. She also supports people with severe deformations and they themselves tell another character (and us) that nobody else except her ever really took care of them and gave them a decent life. Of course, this is also for her to move forward with her gruesome dreams, but still. She is probably also a bit of a feminist if you take a look at how she sometimes speaks about men or also how she paid to free these women, all the female villagers basically, from their prostitution backgrounds. The only thing you can surely say about her is that you can never really be sure with anything she was doing. Seeing her basically as the main opponent to Mononoke is something that also contributed to seeing her as the biggest villain here. But as I stated, there is a lot more to her. Some stuff also confused me, like I have no idea why she was heading to the forest with her men instead of staying with her ""army"" back in the village to protect the place when other enemies were potentially approaching. Instead she was heading out for a fight against nature and took her best men with her of course. She was also a gifted fighter herself as we see, on par with Mononoke. As for the latter, it's a really cool character and I enjoyed watching her for sure, but I still felt her story as well as the film's overall story sometimes tried to be a bit too much for the film's own good, so I cannot really share the overwhelming praise this film has received and also that it is inside the imdb top250. You can see that from my rating. I liked the watch, but not more and I am generally somebody who digs a good environental message and story and this film has a lot to offer in this department.Where it does not have a lot to offer is the comedy. Most anime films, also the older ones, deliver quite a few moments where the audience can laugh, but here these are almost not existent. Maybe you can make a case for the moments relatively early with how the village women are reacting towards the main character and also how they are reacting towards their men on the other hand, but that is really almost it. I guess they kept it serious throughout because Miyazaki did not want to take anything away from the dramatic plot overall and just have the audience focus entirely on ths seriousness of this film. All in all, the characters and the magic of it all are on a level where it is a decent watch for the entire family, also children, but pay attention again to how heads are severed here, also human ones, even if it can be seen very briefly only. I do like the poster here on imdb. Mononoke's somewhat indigenous mask is really cool and I wish we could have seen her wear it on more occasions. Her make-up underneath is fine too though. That is all then. Maybe this is a film that will impress me more on rewatch and I will perhaps see it again at some point, but not anytime soon. As of now, I would say that I found the animals and magic creatures there in the forest really far more interesting than the humans. I must also totally mention those little forest spirits that were so cool with the sounds they were making. There were so many of them, even if when introduced the one we see seemed like a rarity early on. I liked that the film ends with one of those too in the final shot. Pretty cool and I like the idea that our forests are full with these too. Okay, a lot of brainstorming from me in here, but I hope you got the essence. Thumbs-up for this film here.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","tomimt","8 September 2006","'Mononoke-hime' or 'Princess Mononoke', as the translated title goes, tells the old fable of how men cannot live in harmony with their surroundings. Instead of trying to adjust themselves to their surroundings they selfishly try to adjust the surroundings to their needs, in this case the people of Iron Town try to defeat the Forest Spirit, the guardian of the great forest, who is standing in their way in mining out precious iron from the depths of the earth.Prince Ashitaka defeats a wild boar demon near his home village, but in doing so he's injured and the wound casts a cures upon him that will devour him in the end. Thus he is banished from his people and he begins to seek the great Forest Spirit in order to get cured. On his journeys he befriends whit the people of Iron Town and he sets up on another mission as well: to try to get the people and the forest to live together in harmony.The animation and music is just wonderful. The scenery and characters work perfectly and the tempo of the film is almost perfectly balanced between calm moments and action. I haven't seen the original with Japanese voice actors, but I quite liked the English voice cast. At least they sounded like they were interested in doing their jobs and they did it quite nicely.'Princess Mononoke' is a rare gem of animation, aimed towards a bit more mature audience than your average Dinsey films, that while keeps you thrilled whit the beautiful writing and well fleshed out characters, it also gives you something to think about. It can be seen as a statement of how industrialization is good for people in the short term, but how it will eventually turn the surroundings around us, thus destroying the legacy of later generations to come.While many other animations will wither in time, I'm sure that 'Princess Mononoke' will be remembered as one of the classics of animation throughout the time.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Tweekums","5 May 2008","I'd heard good things about this film before seeing it and was not disappointed. The animation and story are excellent as one would expect from a Hayao Miyazaki film. Be warned however that this film isn't as gentle as his other films, we see several people having their heads and limbs removed although this is not shown in graphic close-up.I liked the fact that the conflict between the villagers and the forest creatures wasn't depicted as a clear cut case of good versus bad and like most of Miyazaki's films it has strong female characters that are neither damsels in distress nor trying to marry their Prince Charming like many western animated heroines.The film opens with a possessed giant boar thundering out of the forest and attacking a village. The boar is slain by Prince Ashitake but not before it wounds him. He is told that the found is part of a curse that will ultimately kill him if he doesn't leave his village and seek out the Deer God in forests far to the west.When he gets there he finds the forest creatures in conflict with the inhabitants of a village who are clearing areas of forest to find ore for their iron works. It turns out that Lady Eboshi, the leader of the village, had fired the shot that had caused the boar to be cursed. She is not a typical film villain though as she is very protective of her village and employs former prostitutes and lepers who wouldn't be treated so well elsewhere.Fighting against her is San (Princess Mononoke) a girl that has been raised by the Wolf goddess Moro in the forest and despises humans, and various forest creatures. When she attacks the iron works in a plan to kill Lady Eboshi, Ashitake intervenes to stop them killing each other. As he is taking San out of the village he is seriously wounded but she takes him to the deer god who cures this wound but not the curse.As well as these protagonist there is Jigo who has been employed my the emperor to bring back the head of the deer god as he believe it will give him the power over life and death.I can't comment on the quality of the English dubbing as I've only watched the subtitled version so far.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","jboothmillard","15 August 2006","I saw Japanese cartoon Spirited Away from Studio Ghibli before this film, directed by Hayao Miyazaki, and I was fascinated to see another original animated story with the same imaginative style, dubbed into English. Basically a possessed boar tries to attack a small village, and as the one who defeated him, the creature infects young Ashitaka (Billy Crudup) with an incurable disease. The only way eh may be able to cure his curse is to travel far east and find either the deer God, who makes all plant life grow, or Princess Mononoke, aka San (Claire Danes), raised by wolf Gods and leading the forest animals in the war. Ashitaka is also trying to intervene with the war between the forest and mining colony Tataraba, as they fight for freedom and resources, with all sorts of weird and wonderful characters, creatures, spirits and Gods getting involved. Also starring Gillian Anderson as Moro, Minnie Driver as Lady Eboshi, Jada Pinkett Smith as Toki, Billy Bob Thornton as Jigo, Keith David as Okkoto and Futurama's John Di Maggio as Gonza. The story is a little strange, but bare in mind it is Japanese, but with good dubbing voices and aspiring animation, you'll enjoy the experience.

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","danbranan","24 May 2016","No matter what the New York Post said about it (as is recorded on many of the DVD editions of the film), this is definitely not the pinnacle of animated films, nor even of Miyazaki's own work. I really, really wanted to like this film more than I did. I am a big fan of Miyazaki and this is supposed to be his masterpiece, but I'm just not able to go that far in my own assessment of it. It was complex, and beautifully animated (as you expect from Miyazaki), but it left me a bit hollow. Part of it was the incredible violence in the film (NOT for children under 13, IMO), and part of it was hearing Billy Bob Thornton's drawl as the voice of Jigo, but a big part of my reluctance to rate this film more highly is that it felt a bit like Miyazaki was reaching for something that he had already grasped. I think he addressed almost identical themes in a much better way in Nausicaa. Princess Mononoke seemed uncharacteristically ""preachy"" and heavy-handed, in contrast with Miyazaki's generally subtle style. I know it's super popular and has a stellar reputation, but I just can't recommend it when there are so many other great works available from this true Artist of Anime.","

This is a superb movie with great characters, wonderful animation and music and it also has many important messages for its audience. Characters are not like your black-and-white disney-like stereotype where all the characters are as good or as evil as they can possibly be. No, all characters found here appear to be more like a human being, where everyone possess good as well as evil qualities.  Philosophy also plays an important part here, where one of the movie`s strongest themes is mankind`s relationship with nature. Miyazaki delivers once again a mesmerizing tale that possess both the power to entertain but also to make us think about our role in the world.10/10","

And its weirdness is part of its appeal. There's no guarantee that you will enjoy it but, if you give it a chance, there is a lot to enjoy here.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","morrison-dylan-fan","5 February 2014","For the first (and thankfully up to now,only time) time ever,I found myself in 2009 becoming completely disinterested in seeing films/TV shows,listening to new music and reading fiction novels,due to none of them really connecting with me at that point in time.Searching round for some DVD's to pick up for a friends birthday in late 2009 at a local HMV,I found myself strangely taken by the cover of a Japanamation title. With having never heard of the film before,I was caught by surprise,when I started to get a strong feeling that I had to pick up the DVD right away.Watching the DVD later that night,I found myself being left breathless by writer/director Hayao Miyazaki's complex,yet human plot,and also Studio Ghibli's, (the studio which Miyazaki founded) animation work being unlike anything that I had seen before.As I started to gather up titles to celebrate my upcoming 500th IMDb review,I decided that my 500th review would be the perfect time for me to take a look at my 5th favourite film of all time,which led to me excitingly getting ready for a very special meeting with Princess Mononoke.View on the film:Giving an intelligent cultural context in a narration adaptation by Neil Gaiman,each of the cast (in the English version) members give passionate performances,with Billy Bob Thornton giving the movie a soulful side as Jigo,and Billy Crudup brilliantly expressing Ashitaka's conflicting emotions on the deadly situation that he finds himself in.Joining the guys,Minnie Driver keeps away from giving Lady Eboshi a heart of iron by giving her a firm,but protective voice,with almost all of Eboshi's activates being linked to her wanting to do the best for the people of Iron Town.Perfectly matching her character design,Claire Danes gives a wild performance as San,with Danes showing the survival of the gods to be the thing that drives San's existence,whilst Gillian Anderson gives the film a meditating side,as the voice of the wolf god Moro.Personally drawing (or redrawing) 80,000 of the titles 144,000 animation cells,writer/directing auteur Hayao Miyazaki gives the last ever title to be filmed on plastic cells an astonishing send off. Showing no fear at all in making the movie mature,Miyazaki superbly gives each of the demonic gods a raw visceral edge by allowing blood to flow from every hole of their decaying bodies,with Miyazaki also showing a real eye for tough action scenes,as Ashitaka uses his demon powers to chop peoples arms off,and for decapitations.Contrasting the gory edges of the action scenes,Miyazaki shows an extraordinary eye for detail,with ever branch and leaf in the forest being individually drawn to beautiful detail that, gives the film a powerful Fantasy atmosphere,with Miyazaki also making the characters brilliantly fully dimensional, by allowing for all of their positive's and flaws to be expressed across their faces.Avoiding the risk of the screenplay becoming preachy,Miyazaki makes the environment issue one that is focused on the characters effects on the location,and not on the location itself. Keeping away from making Eboshi a boo-hiss villain,Miyazaki shows,that whilst Eboshi's battles are extreme,that they are firmly rooted to Eboshi wanting to make the residents of Iron Town's lives better.Giving Ashitaka an infection from the start,Miyazaki shows Ashitaka fight against his infection by developing a maturity in his complicated relationship with San,and also taking on the townsfolk and the woodland residence with an unwavering sense of determination,as Miyazaki reveals his Princess to be an unforgettable film.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Red-Barracuda","21 November 2014","Animals, their gods and humans clash in this fantasy adventure from famed Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki. Consequently, nature vs humanity is a strong theme throughout Princess Mononoke, meaning that this is an animated movie with a definite message. Most of the humans, after all, are from a mining village who rape the earth, while the sympathetic people are Ashitaka, a boy who fights to bring peaceful co-existence between the opposing forces and Princess Mononoke who actively sides with the animal world and lives amongst them. It's quite clear, therefore, where the film's sympathies lie, although the ecological message is never delivered in a trite obvious manner and there are many shades of grey throughout.The tone overall is decidedly more mature than most animation and is one of the films from Studio Ghibli that goes for an older adult audience as opposed to the usual family friendly one. It's even quite violent in places, including several decapitations. But irrespective of the darker material it resembles Ghibli anime quite clearly. In any case this renowned animation studio had already released adult fare beforehand, anyone who has seen the harrowing Grave of the Fireflies will understand this. But in terms of visual artistry Princess Mononoke fits right in to the whole Ghibli cannon perfectly. In fact, this one has to be one of their greatest achievements on this front. The forest scenery is stunningly rendered and the invented creatures are consistently interesting. Of note are the wild boars, the night monkeys and the wolf god Moror but most spectacular of all is the deer-like god Shishigami - the colossal nightwalker. This latter being stalks the land in the twilight and generates a strange atmosphere and ambiance all of its own. The scenes towards the end involving it, illustrate the sheer imagination that Ghibli is famed for. The plot-line is not especially great if I am honest but it allows for the film to cover its themes successfully, while integrating them into a wonderfully rendered fantasy world. Like all Ghibli, it benefits considerably too from evolving unashamedly and organically from Japanese culture and mythology; this ensures that from a western perspective, it consistently remains unpredictable and fascinating.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","cherold","2 August 2005","I was a little startled by Princess Mononoke. Having seen Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle and heard their director Miyazaki referred to as Japan's answer to Walt Disney, I wasn't expecting the considerable violence of this movie. It was suited the movie's story and themes certainly, but it sure startled me.But if you're not looking for a Disney flick, this is one impressive and wildly imaginative movie. Many scenes are absolutely amazing, and the last half hour is truly stunning.The attitude of the movie is very interesting. This is basically technology vs. Nature, but even though the film's sympathies lie more with living with nature, the technology side is not portrayed as evil but instead for the most part as good people with a different world view. The absence of black and white thinking in films is rare and always appreciated.While my favorite Miyazaki films will always be the more genial ones like Totoro and Spirited Away, this is still a must-watch movie.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","emryse","13 September 2022","This feels like a back to basics for Miyazaki, his second film (Nausicaa in the Valley of the Wind) was in a wholly original world but the following few were all our world with a touch of magic. Here the world is full of strange creatures, giant boars, deer with the face of god knows what and weird demon monkeys. This film descends into some pretty trippy stuff. Sadly while these weird creatures are fun I think going whole-hog (pun intended) with the fantasy ends up with us losing out on some of the more intimate human elements and small character interactions. They are still present but not as numerous as in his other works which is a shame.The animation is as always delightful, every subsequent film he makes, the animation just gets better and better. The creature and costume designs here shine through as otherworldly, the star being the spirit of the forest. It's difficult to describe but it's a bit like a deer crossed with a baboon. The main protagonist, Ashitaka is likeable, San, the wolf girl, is fine but it didn't feel like I knew enough about her to become attached. My favourite character was this weird ugly short fella, Jiko-bo. At points it's unclear what he's trying to do or why but he's funny to look at which is enough to please my simple brain.This film is good, but for me it never quite lands the with the same punch that films like Totoro, or Kiki's Delivery Service do. This film feels like an attempt at a slightly more grown up tale, showing us blood (surprisingly) and war, and while it's central message of looking after the environment is good. I think this is one of Miyazaki's weaker films.","

Animation is excellent, directing is well done, scenes are epic, characters well developed, voice acting is spot on for dubbed. There's a sense of tension nearly throughout the film, drawing the viewer into this incredible, weird world that looks strangely familiar. Some comical elements thrown in for fun to break up the heavy theme.Despite all the fantastic studio work and bang-up start, it seems the story & writing begin to unravel a bit, wandering, getting lost in the woods. I've seen the film a pair of times, and the end seems to finish with a shrug. It may be a commentary on the reality of mankind and nature, but needed some kind of anchor or point to making the film for it to earn a re-watchable rating.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","ace-150","11 December 2005","This is a sophisticated film with complex cultural, political and personal themes which just happens to be animated. As in real life, each character has parts that you love and parts that you hate. Ashitaka's impassivity in the face of his fate seems beautiful and noble at the beginning of the film but becomes frustrating, even enraging at the end. Eboshi destroys nature to rescue humans on the brink of destruction. Nobody apologizes for their bias, just like in life. Some critics have accused the plot of being driven by the stupidity of the characters, but this critique holds them to the standards of current US society. Nineteenth century Japan was a society strictly regulated by traditions, traditions that were being threatened by Western incursions into Japan. The characters act the only way that they can act - they do their best in an incomprehensible, unsolvable situation. Personally, I sided with Mononoke, but Ashitaka acts with honor in every situation that he faces. I hope that I would have his inner strength in the face of such problems. Things are not neatly wrapped up at the end. This is only one battle in the war between burgeoning Japanese industry and the ancient gods. The war still rages on in Japan as it does in the United States. Oh, the animation is superb. And, for goodness sake, watch it in Japanese with subtitles. If you watch the English version, you won't see the movie the way that it's intended.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","caseyt-48511","9 April 2019","I have a long history with this movie. When I was about 7 I caught it on tv late at night and was interested but didn't know what was happening. I was traumatized by the violence and scary images. I legitimately had nightmares! So I avoided this movie for years. But, nearly 15 years later and I am a big Studio Ghibli fan. I knew I had to watch it. I was not disappointed.
The story of the movie has the feel of a Tolkien epic. A prince goes on a journey to lift a curse off of him. He meets spirits, gods, a town of outcasts and more. The plot is brilliantly put together and tight. There is no wasted moment. The characters are all well written and developed. There's a lot of ambiguity in the film. No character is a stock character and their motives could be easily commended or condemned. I think this leaves the viewer to interpret how they feel.
The animation is so beautiful. Over 100,000 drawings were used in the film. It's colorful, vibrant and feels alive. It screams animated masterpiece.
There's something about Ghibli films that give you a certain feeling. Kinda like what you get when you watch a great classic Disney film. I can't quite put my finger on what the feeling is. Not quite nostalgic, but it's a good feeling nonetheless.
There's so much to talk about. If you love Japanese animation, or just animation in general, then this is a must see! Be warned though! This can be a very violent movie. If you want your younger kids to see a Ghibli film then try My Neighbor Totoro or Ponyo. But once their older, show them this film. Believe me, it's worth every moment.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","SnoopyStyle","18 June 2015","In feudal Japan, Ashitaka protects his village and kills an attacking demon boar. Part of the curse infects his arm. Village elder tells him to travel west to find a cure and encounters a monk who tells him about the great forest spirit. In Irontown, he finds leader Lady Eboshi who freed girls from the brothels and trying to perfect her guns. She is cutting down the forest and killing its animals. Her holy grail is to cut off the head of the forest spirit. She is opposed by animals of the forest and Princess Mononoke who was raised by wolves.I really like the spirits of the forest. I wonder if the movie needs a true villain. Lady Eboshi is more of a Captain Ahab character. The conflict doesn't have the same punch. The other main problem is the clunky dubbed dialog. It really takes work to make the dialog sound natural and not just simple translations. Overall, this has some great imaginative concepts and spirits. This is a special animated movie.","

Do not watch in English unless you want to watch with with kids under the age of 10 (well, when I was 10 I was already watching everything subtitled, people should not be afraid of subtitles).The most powerful experience I ever had watching anything (be either a film, a TV series, theater or a show) was the second time that I watched this film. The first time I didn't really give respect this film deserves (I though it was a childish cartoon and I watching it for a guilty pleasure) and actually failed to really get it. After watching several other movies I remembered this film and I noticed it was truly better than anything else I had watched lately, so I decided to watch it again, this time really paying attention to it: The first few minutes were already better than the last five films I had watched put together. When it ended I cried and was unable to sleep for 5-6 hours, thinking about how freaking awesome this film was.This film features the most powerful score ever. I would call it truly a heavy score, like Black Sabbath, but more epic and without distortion. Most film scores are just background noise that serves to convey emotion, but here the score has a life of its own. Indeed, the score alone makes this film better than 90% of all other movies.Edit: Today a viewed this film for the third time. It became BETTER than the second time. I also viewed 2001: A Space Odyssey for the third time in the same day, and this film totally destroyed 2001 and I consider 2001 one of the best films ever made, but this film made it look like an episode of Family Guy by comparison.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","pmcollectorboy","23 September 2000","Okay. I'm not a big anime fan. I can't stand the ones that look like Dragon Ball Z. I despise the ones that look like Ghost in the Shell. Pokemon is silly. Sailor Moon turned stupid. And so far, the only show that looks decent is Escaflowne. And Pokemon the Movie was the worst animated movie I've ever seen. I didn't even bother seeing the sequel. I was also slightly disappointed by Grave of the Fireflies. But this. This is something else. This is something magical. It's probably the only anime movie worth watching, although I could be wrong. First the positives. The characters are realistic and well developed. There are no true ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"". The story is also great, sometimes sophisticated. Although the premise has been done to death, this is more than just your average environment movie. Finally, there's the animation. It's beautiful and breathtaking, especially with the backgrounds. The Nightwalker sequence is probably the one of the better animated pieces in history. Now the negatives. While the movie is wonderful to look at, the animation technique is still anime, which drives me crazy to no end. Those used to Disney's fluid style of drawing and animating will find the hyperactivity and shortcuts of anime a tad unrealistic and maybe even cartoonish. The movie also tries to do too many things at once, and as a result, certain parts look unfinished, rushed, or unpolished. Some parts even seem unnecessary. Finally there's the ending. Do all animes end in a wimpy, ambiguous note? Because I'm not used to it. These flaws aren't enough to make it a bad movie. On the contrary, this is a fantastic movie. However, this won't receive a perfect 10 from me, just a 9.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","steve.schonberger","29 November 1999","Princess Mononoke is stunningly beautiful art, with wondrous detail in nearly every scene. The animation is rich and imaginative; the demon forms and the forest god's ""night walker"" form are images I've never seen before, and the forest scenes are full of beauty and wonder. The sometimes-gory violence isn't just mindless action; one can almost feel the pain of characters when they are injured. Even the dubbed English (the only version I've seen) script is matched fairly well to the original lip movements. The voice actors are good or excellent, particularly Minnie Driver (Lady Eboshi), Billie Crudup (Ashitaka), and Jada Pinkett (Toki, a smaller part). Finally, the story is deep and thoroughly involving.The depth of the plot is shown in the way the many factions act. Each contends for its own interests, rather than for an abstract cause of good or evil. Most believe their own cause to be good, and opposing interests to be the enemy; each shows goodness and flaws.In the simplest view, the conflict is between the Lady Eboshi's industrial Iron Town and the gods and animals of the forest. But there are more factions in conflict than just those two.The remainder, except the final paragraph, includes possible minor spoilers.In the introduction, Ashitaka fights a demon -- a god driven to madness by pain and hate. He kills it, at the cost of a curse that will slowly kill him. He chooses permanent exile from his home, the dying idyllic Emishi civilization (elsewhere thought to be long dead). He sets out on his quest with a heart unclouded by hate, in hope of the possibility that the curse might be overcome.He travels West to the source of the conflict that turned the god into a demon, and learns of the numerous factions in the conflict. One major side is the Forest, with its gods and animals, divided into a number of factions. The other major side is the humans, also divided into several factions, most in conflict with the Forest.The Forest is united in its desire to prevent destruction by human encroachment, but divided into factions with different ideas of how to protect their world. The boars favor a frontal assault, to kill the humans or die trying, even though they're somewhat aware that they're more likely to die trying. The monkeys favor a defensive approach, replanting the forest and killing humans opportunistically. The wolves -- including San, the Princess Mononoke -- understand the humans' strength from fighting them, and hate them, but urge caution in fighting such a dangerous enemy. Finally, there are the Forest Spirit and the Kodamas, whose motivations are deep and mysterious.The humans are divided also. Lady Eboshi and her Iron Town are the main human faction. Eboshi is loved by her people, who include outcasts from other human societies: former prostitutes whose freedom she has bought and lepers she has taken in. Instead of conventional women's clothing, she wears a man's pirate coat. A minor faction is the samurai, who seek Lady Eboshi's iron. Another human faction is the monk Jigo, who befriends Ashitaka but seeks (with his hunters) the mountain of gold the emperor has promised to anyone who can bring him the forest's secret of immortality.Finally, there is Ashitaka, who starts out with his own agenda, to overcome his fatal curse. Along the way, he learns to see the good in both the Forest and Iron Town. He becomes a friend of them both, and looks for a solution that allows both of his new friends to survive, while continuing to hope for a cure to his curse.Few movies have this much depth of plot detail. The story is deeply involving, and takes many unexpected paths. The art is beautiful, wonderfully imaginative, and moving. The animation and voices are well done. I could find no flaws. This is one of the best movies ever.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","twofold420","2 March 2008","I haven't seen this movie in a long time, but I still stand by my choice as this being the best film of the 1990s (that I saw anyway). This was simply the most stunning and beautiful animation I have ever seen. Disney wishes they can make a movie that looks this good. From the opening scene in Ashitaka's village to the forest of the gods, and even the factories of Iron Town, Miyazaki never lets up on creating a wonderful piece of cinematic beauty (He drew over half the frames himself). Also his attention to detail with how the rain falls and hits the ground, how characters move and talk, and flies buzzing in the background. Hell, live action movies wish they could do something this good.All that is worth two hours of your time, but now we add a complex story where there are no good guys and bad guys just people. There is a lot of action in this film which is unusual for a Miyazaki film, but the plot calls for it, and it doesn't detract from the character development. Each character is well defined and has real depth. The screenplay is powerful and emotional. Most live action films can't achieve the complexity of Princess Mononoke, and it would have to be even harder for animation to convey real life feelings, but as I watched it, the script and beauty kept drawing me in further and further.The voice acting was OK for the US version, and outstanding for the Japanese version. Billy Bob Thorton was completely wrong for any part of this movie (a southern accent in Japan?). The other American voices were all adequate. Interesting note, the voice for the wolf god that Gillian Anderson does was done by a male for the Japanese version. The music was as breathtaking as the animation, and was a perfect match, especially at the end during the restoration scene. This is one of the best musical scores I ever heard, and I'm surprised it didn't get the recognition it deserved. Anyways, the song (Japanese, not American) was also beautiful. 10/10 for both US and Japanese versions, but watch the Japanese version if you can.","

I wasn't sure what was going on, and who was this movie about again, who is this ""Mononoke Hime"". But as I watched this movie over and over again, the plot started opening, and I began to understand and realize things I didn't notice before. I have always loved the way Miyazaki draws his characters expressions. Unlike some other anime movies I've seen, Miyazakis characters are more easier to read. And this is where the difference of reality and cartoons steps in. Its easy to overdo your characters expressions, and so spoil the movie, and make it look stupid, even childish. This isn't a mistake that Miyazaki would do. A big bonus for that!Mononkoe Hime surpasses even the famous ""Nausicaa, the valley of the wind"". Im totally impressed!","

It was so much more beautiful then the Disney/Pixar movies. After i had seen Spirited Away i tried frantically to find Princess Mononoke on the internet.Princess Mononoke is a story about a prince named Ashitaka. He goes on a journey to find a cure for Tatarigami's curse. On the journey he finds himself in the middle of a war between a human Iron-town and the gods of the woods. He also meets Princess Mononoke, a girl who is raised by wolves and is filled with hate against humans.I think Princess Mononoke was even better than Spirited Away. It outclasses its Hollywood-synonym, Lord Of The Rings. The plot is very good. The soundtrack is amazing, it's a shame that the Academy Award didn't notice it. The animation is beautiful, especially the characters. The only thing i can complain about is the English dubbing. Billy Crudup does a splendid job as the voice of Ashitaka, but they could really have chosen a better alternative than Billy Bob Thornton as Jigo.Overall i give this movie 9 out of 10.","

For the protection of his kin and in order to revert this process, he leaves on a journey. He finds a young woman running a lead mill crafting rifles, with ambitions of rule and no care for the damage she does to nature(and he is suffering some of the consequences). And thus we get the not-so-subtle message(hint: she represents mankind). ""Can't we all just get along"" is the idea, but it does actually take the problem more seriously(with a mature sensibility) than other of these, such as Dances With Wolves, Pocahontas, and most recently, Avatar. This also gets into the theme of anger and hate being self-destructive, not only harmful to one's surroundings. There are a lot of concepts in this, and fully comprehending and following it may require several viewings, time devoted to piecing it all together, and prior knowledge and understanding of Japanese culture. This is not for children, or even teens, but adults, setting it apart from every other Miyazaki production I've seen, which is nearly all of them. The acting is very good, and I urge you to watch this with subtitles, not dubbed. I do wonder why they did not sync up the animals, unlike the humans. The animation is excellent, with memorable designs, and mood expertly built by, among other things, the right amount(and tone, nuance) of light and dark(it also knows when and how to use sound, as well as silence). There is a bit of action, and it's intense, visually appealing and well-choreographed. Sans credits, this is 124 minutes long. The DVD comes with trailers for Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbour Totoro, Porco Rosso, Ponyo, this and Howl's Moving Castle, 2 Promos(coming to a running time of 8 minutes), 3 teasers(2 minutes put together) and 6 TV spots(totaling at 2 minutes). There is a lot of disturbing content, and, what seems somewhat gratuitous, a little violence, blood, gore and hints of sexuality. I recommend this to fans of Anime and those who want films that deal with the environment. 8/10","

The story is great, the colourful and detailed animation moves the fable along well and excitingly with plenty of solid characterisation and action a-plenty. As ever with Miyazaki, there is a moral to the story - and the last twenty minutes exemplify that beautifully.

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","gbill-74877","25 April 2021","There's so much to love about this Studio Ghibli production, with its beautiful animation and messages of environmentalism and co-existence. It starts off seeming like it will be another fantasy involving a young man going off to fight essentially as good vs. Evil, but we soon see it's not as simple as that. In fact, the character is more often a mediator, so much in the middle that others wonder whose side he's on, which I thought was a nice touch. There are two strong female characters on each side of the conflict, and I loved the nuance in that of Lady Eboshi, the leader of an iron works. She rescues girls from slavery and gives lepers jobs, seemingly a virtuous character defending her operation from the animals which threaten it, but we find that she's also ambitious and her campaign of deforestation is done with ultimate goal of power. She's doing what people do but it's destroying the ecosystem, which is then reacting. Meanwhile there are conflicts within both sides, e.g. Samurai vs. Ironworkers, and apes vs. Wolves vs. Boars. That makes the plot probably a little messier than it should have been, and a film with more action scenes (and associated carnage) than necessary, but it underscores the message that conflict is inevitable, and that mediation is critical to allow both sides to live in harmony. It's all wrapped up in creative visuals done with a wonderful aesthetic, making for an appealing film.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Pjtaylor-96-138044","24 March 2020","'Princess Mononoke (1997)' is a story about humans vs nature, an age-old struggle here categorised by a literal war, that tries to implore a balance between the two intrinsically linked elements but never feels as though it's 'preaching'. The piece works as an epic adventure regardless of its real-life relevancy, chock-full of Studio Ghibli's signature strangeness and odd underlying charm. It's much more serious than the studio's usual stuff, though. Its beautiful animation is as often used to evoke fear as wonder, the piece being surprisingly heavy - and violent - for a 'PG' animated piece. This isn't a bad thing, depending on who you are, because it allows for a mature yet enjoyable tale. The thing is rich and exciting, building towards a genuinely tense finale. Its characters are also rather multi-faceted, never quite conforming to the expectation of their role. It's a really solid story with some great action, resonant themes and interesting animation. It's probably Miyazaki's finest work. 8/10","

This movie is a stunning clash of positive and negative aspects. It's basically blockbuster syndrome where the whole thing looks and sounds stunning but upon closer examination is pretty shallow.Basically everything about this movie is amazing but its script. Visually stunning with its lush setting coming up against the forces of modernity. The sparing but startling usage of CGI to represent the unholy. The mood, switching from epic battle of man and crazed demon to quite reflection as a stone gets speckled in rain. It ebbs and flows from peaceful to fiery that is hypnotic and compelling. The score will be your new guilty pleasure too.I've seen both the original and English dub. It was back at a time where I struggled to rarely take notice of voice performance when I was reading, but the English dub is fine. It's a mix of tolerable performances (like Mononoke and the main guy) plus some rather enchanting ones (the lascivious guy with the wart plusthe sultry english leader of the human forces).Now for the script: it's sort of different to have a protagonist caught between two sides, neither of which is fully in the wrong but this grey-lighter grey-white morality gets pretty sickly very quickly. I liked the apes and the Kodamas, they were all cool. But the message about the poisonous quality of hate was naive.The protagonist is a one dimensional mouth piece for the writer. He experiences no character development and barely expresses any emotion. He just stoically accepts that he's been banished and does so. He gets a little passionate when he gives grand sanctimonious lectures but they have little nuance beyond ""war is bad, environment is good"". I can totally get behind this on principle but it gives me nothing on how to put this into practice.The title character doesn't really do much. You know that kid in school that chastized you for eating meat? She's that. They try to sort of make them romantic interests but...I don't care about either of them.It ends more satisfyingly that its writers movies usually do. I got real sense of high stakes and conflict that wasn't resolved by easy answers.Frozen is a movie for all ages. This was a kids' movie.See it, but but expect a movie by a master animator, not a master storyteller.","

It's pretty easy to imagine that a Miyazaki film would be my favorite for anime. What's really great is how gorgeously beautiful the animation is. Even when you get used to Miyazaki's artwork, you just still never stop being amazed at how beautiful it is. I remember reading a review of ""Pokémon 4Ever"" saying that it's obvious that director saw this movie. Yeah, it's very easy to see that as a ripoff to this movie. I mean, we feature a forest spirit and a lake that heals people and a character being absorbed into a monster.Wow, did they really think they could make something good out of a Miyazaki ripoff? Anyway, this actual movie is amazing. I heard that Miyazaki was good at romance, but honestly, I don't see that much romance in this or his other works. Still, it's a wonderful movie. One of the best parts is near the end, because of how realistic it is. It features the title Princess saying that she still doesn't trust humans but the main character is welcome to visit her in the forest while he goes back to the human world.The destroyed city is going to be rebuilt and I guess it's implied they're going to be better off this time. The spirit of the forest actually ends up dying. There's these great and truly frightening scenes where the giant boar is covered in these blood worm things. It's so powerful and horrifying. We get great battle scenes throughout the entire movie of course. It's cliché to teach about the environment, but this movie does it fine. Everything isn't perfect in the end, but at least we've learned something. ****","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","ThomasDrufke","16 September 2016","A visceral story from the brilliant mind of Hayao Miyazaki, Princess Mononoke is a joyous ride through the eyes of Ashitaka, a brave warrior who finds himself caught in the crossfire of relentless humans and vicious creatures of the forest.Speaking of relentless, even at over 2 hours long, this film flies by with brisk pacing and gorgeous animation by Studio Ghibli. For an animation film, the runtime is unusually long, but the epic scope and beautiful storytelling transcend typical animations. One of my first thoughts while watching was how good this story could be in live- action form. Even if it's a television series, the lore calls for this to be adapted into live-action.The mythology is incredibly well-realized and thought out as well. Each of the several sides to this ongoing battle against the forest have reason for fighting. Yes, Ashitaka is the protagonist, but I wasn't necessarily rooting for any particular side to win. That's when you know the characters have plenty of depth. My only real complaint here is that sometimes the dialogue comes out a bit dull and lacks the gravitas that the very scene calls for. Of course, this may only be in the English dubbed version that I watched, or the script. Either way, the story is brilliant, but the dialogue just didn't match it.Above everything else, Princess Mononoke is a special film. It transcends the usual tropes of animated films by being a viscerally graphic war film with plenty of heart and thought provoking ideas. It's no surprise this is praised as one of Miyazaki's very best films.+So different than any animated film+Meaningful violence+Interesting mythology+All characters have depth87/100","

They all have a certain sensitive demeanor and tone, a very carefully realized world in each one. As it is, it's always a pleasure to get lost within those worlds no matter the circumstances. Here, I saw this one in an English dubbing but it was pretty great. The voices really lend something to the proceedings that is not that easy to really get at by reading subtitles, even though that is always the preferred method.

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Boris-57","18 September 2004","... despite much has been made of Neil Gaiman's dubbed lines, you should absolutely watch it in Japanese with subtitles. The dubbing actors seem not to completely understand the intonations their characters' lines require, which, to me, made the first 20 minutes rather confusing. It was only when I switched to Japanese that it all seemed to make sense. Don't ask me why, like I said I guess it's intonation. Furthermore, it's always daft not to see a movie in its original language. And that goes for anime too, unless you still believe it's not real film.But this is! OK, we've seen the story about nature vs humans before (after all, is that not what the Arthur / Merlin / Morgana / Mob legends are all about?), but what makes this one stand apart is 2 things: 1. no one is all good or all evil; 2. the visuals are stunning and testify of an imagination unbound by logic. These 2 points are crucial, for it is there that most Disney films or plain Hollywood films go wrong - one could say that they're made by 5 year olds. But no, it's just the reverse! Most Disney animation and Hollywood stuff is made by 'soundly reasoning' adults with an emotional life not reaching beyond love and hate, motivational insight not going beyond revenge (or getting laid) and an imagination enslaved to logic. This film isn't, and as a consequence some call it 'difficult'. And not suitable for children. Let me tell you, 5 year olds have, with their boundless imagination, no difficulty getting into this.This film is just so good it's hard to believe someone just sat down at a table, wrote the thing and then drew it on a piece of paper.** Addition ** I've recently read the Nausicaa anime, and it becomes even clearer now that Mononoke is Miyazaki's re-take on his Nausicaa film (which was premature even in its full-length format), with Nausicaa split in two over Ashitaka & San. However, though this is obviously Miyazaki's second best (after Laputa), it remains difficult to pour all the complex musings about man's relationship to nature in 2 hours (the Nausicaa manga is over a 1000 pages long and took him 13 years; when it was finished he made Mononoke). Hence, some things (like Ashitaka helping out Eboshi even after she's done such evil deeds) have left some viewers bewildered. In all, I found the persona of Nausicaa (in the manga) more fit, in her responsible role as a princess, to convey The Message than the split version here. Still, the very idea about man & technology vs. nature and the question of ""is anything ever over"" (ewige wiederkehr, the cycle of life) is at its most nuanced here. In any case, image-wise, I doubt you'll ever see anything as beautiful as this.","

There he encounters a feral young woman, the adopted daughter of a wolf-God, who is fighting to preserve the forest from encroaching human civilisation. Directed by Hayao Miyazaki, the film is a stunning example of anime, with a rich palette and striking, memorable imagery (I especially liked the 'kodama', the odd, endearing little forest spirits). Although a clear message is sent about valuing the Earth and recognising the dangers of exploitation, the story is complex and ambiguous (especially compared to the simplistic morality plays usually pawned off as 'educational'). The look is typical of Ghibli anime (except Lady Eboshi, who looks a bit out of place) and, although the voices in the English version I watched were a bit bland, I found the characters engaging and interesting (although always secondary to the imagery). The music was also compelling and well matched to the mood and action. All in all, an excellent philosophical fantasy-adventure from the incomparable talents at Studio Ghibli.","

The masterpiece that everyone likes! and his praised by critics and reviewers around the World to be ghibli's best film. Why?.. Maybe I was never drawn to the cover art.. I thought It looked like a bad version of Zelda. So all these years have passed And I have watched all his Movies countless times over. So finally My mind was set. I started watching Princess Mononoke. The Masterpiece of all masterpieces praised to the skies! ..Boy Was I in for a big surprise! It totally sucked!! My Eyes wasn't moved to tears, I started yawning to the action scenes several times.. I was wondering..Is this Studio Ghibli? I didn't like the soundtrack, The romance never took off, For one, they didn't know each other nearly long enough to fall in love. the movie just kinda made it up and expected you to believe it. There was zero evidence of actual romance Eboushi just magically changes her mind at the end? The ending was so anti-climactic. So this girl that he is ""in love with"" decides he isn't important enough for her to invite him to live with her in the Forrest. He also doesn't care enough about the girl that ""he loves"" to follow her in the end. He'd rather go help the townspeople he met last week?!? LOL OK. After all they went though they just decide to part ways & visit each other sometimes, WTF is up with the ending??? The ending... what was the Point of cutting the head of the deer god?? so the emperor girl could awake and understand she did wrong?? she had to kill thousands of boars, shopping every tree, kill Everything just to come to that conclusion that it was pointless? The worst part of this Movie is that I absolutely adored Mononoke. But they never took advantage of that, she is Always out of camera somehow you never get to know her, except she hates humans. It feels like they made this Movie for American audience. Is that why it has such high scores? cause of the generic plot, action, blood and all that usual Hollywood crap? sorry buts that the truth. I can't find Another reason why the big fans of Ghibli actually love this one. It's Not that great. It's the worst ghibli Movie i ever seen actually.

While I can't say I like it more than ""Nausicaä,"" I can definitely understand why this film was as popular and successful as it was.Let me just say though, it's probably Miyazaki's darkest, and most pessimistic, film. Severed heads, severed limbs, and a surprising amount of blood amd gore are featured in the film. No problem with this really, but it can be shocking coming off films like, ""My Neighbor Totoro.""Miyazaki counters this pessimism with his usual happy ending though, and it makes great use of his two major themes. Love, and respect for nature. In fact, the respect for nature theme may come off as heavy-handed for some, but it never bothered me.The film also has a wonderful English dub. A classic for a reason!

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","guisreis","10 June 2021","This epic film has the signature of the Studio Ghibli: beautifully animated, carefully working in each minor detail, with well developped characters and immersing spectator in that bright world. It is impressive how each Ghibli film has a deep and encompassing universe from its own. This one, different from others of their films, takes place in a fantastic Japan, not in a place ressembling Europe. In my opinion, this is not among the best Ghibli films (their average level is extremely high), as it is perhaps too long and sometimes seems unfocused, but it is still a quite good movie. What is its greatest merit, brilliant and unique, is its approach about the core issue: there is a metaphoric war between the modern/progress/industry/development and nature. Off course a balance between both is desirable but it is always hard to be measured and achieved. Exploiting nature is recurrently seen as evil, because of all evironmental problems we face. Indeed, greed and irresponsability are common traits of humans and they drove us to this situation. On the other hand, progress is not compatible not to change environment, and reactionary views on that usually do not care about poverty and inequality among people and countries. Nature is not only what gives us our resources, but is also brutal, dangerous, and challenges our survival when we are exposed. All that complexity appears in the movie in the shape of two opposite sides: humans want to destroy the forest motivated by greed but also by keeping their beloved community safe; the savage forces of nature led by Princess Mononoke and some entities want to preserve it untouched and to kill invading civilization. There is no manichaeism. Both sides commit mistakes, have good reasons, do not see the other side as an interlocutor, and may be ruthless. Indeed this is the most violent film by Studio Ghibli I have watched. To resume, this animated film establishes a wonderful ""mithology"" about the layered clash between progress and nature, in which the most they fight, the most both lose.","

What makes this version unique is the amount of nuance in which it tells its story. Avoiding many of the mistakes others have fallen into by refusing to make its conflict easy and offering mature points of view.Youji Matsuda's Ashitaka is the ideal way into this world and war. He's headstrong and morally centred in a way that never wavers. Yuriko Ishida's San is equally headstrong with a mission she's determined to finish. The blossoming romance between them is allowed to take its time without having to commit to a true relationship by the end, which makes it even stronger.Hayao Miyazaki's direction inverts a lot of the usual ideas whilst still delivering pure imagination. There's definitely plenty of that trademark awe inspiring wonder but with a darker story there's also some disturbing imagery as gods morph into demons. Joe Hisaishi's score perfectly encapsulates the beauty and brutality of this world.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Vartiainen","3 March 2019","The magnum opus of director Hayao Miyazaki and one of the if not the best animation movie ever made. A film that children can watch no doubt, but which still deals with the themes of loss, sacrifice, the non-existent line between good and evil, war, death and the dying state of divinity and spirituality. It's a heavy movie, yet it's never so excessively dark and brutal that you couldn't show it to a twelve-year- old.For me, this is one of those perfect movies that you have the honour of coming across every once in a while. Because it's really hard to find any faults in this movie.The animation? Superb, mind-blowing, unbelievably beautiful from the very first shot of mountains covered in mist to the last shot of the great forest reaching for the heavens.The music? Haunting, soul-altering, beautiful beyond believe. The main theme has had a spot on my daily playlist ever since I saw this film.The characters? Magnificent. Detailed, fluidly animated, easily having more depth than most live-action characters ever created. I also love how this movie has no clear bad guys. The clash between the spirits of the forest and the civilization of man is the central focus of the film, but you very quickly realize that neither of those sides is in the wrong. They both have reasons for their actions, for defending what they see as theirs. The methods of both are at the same time commendable and questionable. Name one other movie where you've seen anything similar. I bet you have to think about it for a while.If you had to point fingers and say that those are the bad guys, you probably would go with the bounty hunters. But even they're rather likable as characters and are only doing what they're doing because it's their job. So yeah, not even them.And sure, the movie has flaws. No film has not. The eponymous Mononoke is not all that central to the conflict and is easily the most boring of the main characters. The deer god does look silly. Don't act like he doesn't. Other things like that. But they're all really minor. Nitpicks, if even that. Because the film is just that good.Princess Mononoke renews my hope for life every time I see it. It hasn't lost even a hint of its beauty, splendor and impact over the years. If you're ever going to see only one Japanese animation, see this one. Or Spirited Away.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","firehead_lazzo","10 February 2013","I would never say that I hate anime, but I am usually bored and confused by it. So much anime acts thoughtful and deep, but ends up being fairly shallow and simple (see: Neon Genesis and Death Note). Miyazaki has always been a person I could turn to for anime that is both fun AND thought-provoking. Please understand that I am as surprised as you are when I say that I really didn't like this movie.Now, I don't hate Mononoke. I enjoyed the spectacle, and I recognize that it is very well-made. The story is competently told and the setting is interesting.My problem is with the characters. No one in Mononoke acts like a human being. The prince is a perfect angel who isn't affected by human emotions like fear and greed. He is utterly flawless and boring. I mean sure, he's been cursed, but it doesn't really seem to do much to him. In fact, it only appears to make him stronger. What's he complaining about?The women of Irontown are the most hateful people I could possibly imagine. After the attack, one of them joked, ""If you hadn't been there, we'd all have to find ourselves new husbands."" That's really funny, except to all of the women whose husbands are actually DEAD. What sort of callous, spiteful monster would say something like that? And worse, who would laugh at such an inappropriate joke? That same lady's husband was pushed off a cliff, almost died, and struggled for days to return home to his wife. When he finally makes it back home, what does she do? He calls him a dumbass and berates him in front of everyone. ""I wish the wolves had eaten you! Then maybe I could've found a real husband."" What a heartless bitch! There is no sense of love or camaraderie from anyone. I don't believe that these two have ever actually loved each other.I could understand this if the animals were portrayed sympathetically. They are not. All of the animals are rather dickish about eating and destroying everything in their path. The people of Irontown are only trying to defend themselves and they are made out to be the villains. Sure, they're destroying the forest, but it doesn't appear like the rest of the world is all that bad; just this place.In fact, the only person in the movie who I actually liked was Lady Obashi, the evil gun-toting power-hungry psychopath. Sure, she wanted to rule the world, but she felt like a human being. She was kind to the lepers, took pity on the whores and gave them all new and rewarding jobs. She loved her people and wanted to protect them. But she's supposed to be the villain? I don't buy it.And what about the pig? I understand that the first pig turned into a demon because he was filled with rage, but what about the old pig? The last thing he felt was hope that all of his warriors were still alive. Why did he become a demon when he wasn't full of hate? For that matter, all of the other animals WERE full of hate. All of the wolves, the monkeys, and most of the pigs were hateful, vengeful bastards. Why didn't they turn into demons? It doesn't make any sense.Perhaps the depth of this movie has been lost on me. Perhaps Miyazaki is trying to say that war can make a monster out of anyone, no matter how noble his cause. I suppose that would make for an interesting film, but I don't feel like that's what Miyazaki was trying to say. As it currently stands, I think that this is Miyazaki's weakest film.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","pc95","30 March 2009","Although not among my favorite Miyazaki films, Princess Mononoke must be given high praise for what is the standard for classical animation - Miyazaki. It's story is intriguing, but perhaps the most violent of any Miyazaki film - maybe too much. Despite that, it conjures up an interesting more historically leaning movie pitting man against nature. My favorite ideas in the movie were the kodama or forest sprites living in abundance to mark the health of the natural growth of plants, flowers, and animals as well as the kami-shika (deer god). Both were fantastically creative. The characters in the movie were fairly well done and the lack of romance was appealing. Perhaps more than other Miyazaki movies the hues of green in this movie jump out of the screen in colors as striking as any Miyazaki film. What I found a bit lacking (only in comparison) was some of the wonder and fantasy in other Miyazaki films which carry them to truly magical heights. Nonetheless, Mononoke-hime is a violent cautionary tale maybe meant to be so to jolt his usual audiences.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Movi3DO","9 March 2021","Don't mess with nature. Wow this movie really reflected the fame it got. In addition to the longest run-time compared to the previous Ghibli movies, the animation was also much more impressive and breathtaking. I was hooked from the opening, which showed an intense chase and fight scene. The story was intricate and made me want to see how it would all unveil. Unexpectedly, there were a lot of gore, which made the action even more thrilling. The theme about man versus nature and how nature can strike back were adamantly clear and impactful not only in 1997, but also now. For me, this is the best movie from Miyazaki so far and it was a phenomenal experience. 9.5/10","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","etg1701","9 April 2007","There have been many times where after watching an anime, I have found myself seriously questioning the value of the medium. Whether due to misogynism, gratuitous violence, or tentacles, I walk away wondering what is going on in Japanese culture. Princess Mononoke, like Miyazaki's other works, is not a vehicle for shameless fan-service, nor does it rely on the tired and implausible concept of mecha as its selling point, unlike so much anime I have seen. Instead, it deals with the age-old tension between human attempts to shape the environment for its own ends and the life-and-death power of nature.Despite its clear point, Princess Mononoke does not stray into obvious lines of good and evil or try to drop the message on the viewer like an anvil. Rather, it portrays both sides of the conflict in a balanced manner, showing the good and the bad and depicting the harm brought by hate on both sides. Perhaps the only major flaw I can see is that Miyazaki's romanticized monarchism, which leads him to again bring out the decidedly clichéd heroic warrior-prince/princess.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Blue-Grotto","25 June 2017","Something is wrong. A shapeless rage and powerful demon appears on the outskirts of a small village. Animals as well as humans are poisoned and cursed at its touch. Ashitaka, a perceptive and valiant young man and peacemaker who is wise beyond his years, recognizes that this demon is blinded by its own agony. He attempts to quiet its rage and direct the sinister power away from the village. Despite his efforts and care to avoid the demon, and his success at saving the village, Ashitaka is touched by the curse. The village oracle encourages him to journey with unclouded eyes and open mind to the source of the demon's rage - a distant forest - where Ashitaka may be able to find a way to lift the curse. The journey takes Ashitaka to an ironworks encroaching on the forest, where people, animals and demons are at war with each other, and with themselves. As Ashitaka looks for a way to lift the curse and keep from harm, he uncovers secrets of the place and characters. This includes a mysterious and beautiful young princess allied with the wolves; Mononoke.Twenty years ago, in Georgetown, a Japanese embassy sponsored advertisement of the film caught my eye. I encouraged my fiancé to come. It was our first Miyazaki film and I was stunned by its insight, wisdom, artistry and beauty. It touched on some of my basic beliefs about human nature, love and the environment. A recent trip to Japan and the remote island of Yakushima (used as a model for scenes in the film) deepened my appreciation for Princess Mononoke.The artistic beauty is timeless and dazzling to the senses. Mist rises from the mountains and ancient forests of gigantic cedars. Rainstorms, shadows, clouds and rivers appear to rush over you as they pass on screen. The landscape character is revealed in the variable light of the sun and moon. The incredible attention to detail is evident in eyes that sparkle in the night, light and ripples on water, wind on grass, haunting bird songs, different shades of stone, the flash of gunpowder and a night sky filled with stars.There is incredible complexity to the characters; female and male, animal and human, earth and supernatural. This complexity is heightened by immersion in the Japanese culture wherein spirits and demons take human or animal form, or something in between - or even beyond - both. Twenty years ago, I ruminated about my fiancé and wondered what characteristics she shared with the fascinatingly intricate, attractive, stylish and spirited female characters. Mononoke and Lady Eboshi, both willful, fearless and independent, deftly navigate the male oriented world. The two are separated by belief. Eboshi is realistic. ""We have more to fear from ourselves than from demons or monsters,"" she wisely maintains. Mononoke is idealistic about the forest and, of course, wolves. Ashitaka, the peacemaker, is respectful and observant of others. He has the admirable ability to see through the eyes of strangers and understand how they feel. Tough and vulnerable at the same time, he helps others and shrugs off aggression.There are so many bits of wisdom scattered throughout the film and in surprising places. One important and recurring theme is the precarious balance of the natural world and our relationships to others. We are connected to the environment and others in all we do, and this film underscores this point. Destruction and violence just create more hatred. The film pushes us to be non-judgmental and hopeful like Ashitaka. New life is always on the threshold and within reach, if we allow it. We may not know what form it takes, but we must leave space for it to grow. We are alive, and we have each other. The film dialogue is delightfully intricate and unpredictable. The competing interests, changing circumstances and shifting balances of life are skillfully portrayed. We cannot change fate, but we can rise to meet it.The story is based in a time when Japan, 150 years ago, was suddenly transforming from the ancient ways, to iron, gunpowder and other technologies and beliefs. Listening to the film in Japanese, with English subtitles, adds another wonderful dimension to the film. One of my favorite films ever.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","planktonrules","11 June 2007","Every movie viewer has different tastes and sometimes a film appeals to one person and not another, or vice-versa. I know that this film set attendance records in Japan and is adored by many and I will admit that TECHNICALLY it is a super well-made film--with nice animation throughout--and in many ways better than the average Disney film. However, despite all this, I just felt very little connection to PRINCESS MONONOKE as the story didn't interest me very much and lacked the charm of other Miyazaki films. Apart from the cute little forest spirits, it was obviously a very adult film and was 180 degrees different from MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, my personal favorite Miyazaki film. So, if you like the cute style Miyazaki films like me, you'll probably not appreciate this film as much as others who want a film with an agenda that focuses on nature and conservation. As for me, I don't want a message film--I want one that is just plain fun.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","EdwardtheBlackPrince","31 March 2021","Princess Mononoke was directed by Hayao Miyazaki and is the 11th film. It tells the story of a prince named ashitaka who after a cursed boar spirit attacks his village is cursed. Traveling east to find the source of the boar hatred. Ashitaka comes upon a town of outcasts and leapers lead by a woman name Eboshi. We learn that the humans of this village are at war with the spirits of the forests, humans are digging up iron ore and Desecrating the forest. As a result, it's weakening the spirits Resulting in many being turned into demons. Amongst these spirits is a human girl name San known throughout the forest as princess Mononoke raised by wolf spirits she aids them against the humans. The most notable aspect of this film is the amount of blood and gore as well the action. This is hands-down the studio's most graphic film with dismemberment, bloody wounds, and piles of corpses. It's rather serious essentially a war movie between men and nature. The overall tone of this movie is that there's not a de facto villain. It would be easy to pin Lady Eboshi as the villain that not entirely true. She's destroying the forest, she has a motive driven out by the Emperor. Caring for the lives of her people. She sees the forest as a new potential for them, willing to sacrifice to prosper. She's more interested in the money not knowing the consequences of her actions. Ashitaka is the Voice of reason stoic and Courageous he's trying to prevent conflict between the spirits and the humans so it doesn't lead to more suffering for others. You believe he's not afraid to die but he still fights to protect everything. Course the last major character is princess Mononoke how design is creative, her stories similar to Mowgli from the jungle book being raised by wolves. Similar to Nausicaa of the valley of the wind she's a warrior and she knows how to fight. Moving swift in the fight offers adrenaline. One of the small downsides is that you don't get much time to know her. The choice in scenery is an excellent choice before the tale of Princess Kaguya this was the only film set in ancient Japan so I always gave it a distinct personality. Playing off of the concept of nature and spirits the Settings are beautiful tons of landscapes panned over there show off the scale and effort put into this world. Huge amount of detail are put into the forest and the water. The design of the forest spirit & Kodama is creative. Princess Mononoke is action-packed and remains one of the best works in animation.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","griffolyon12","28 July 2009","Princess Mononoke is a rare film, one that manages to transcend its animated exterior and become simply an amazing film.Princess Mononoke is an epic fantasy, following the battle between the ancient forest spirits in feudal Japan and the persistent humans that are pillaging their forests. It is a beautiful tale about love, humanity, and the environment.Director Hayao Miyazaki is simply a master at his craft. Not only is the film highly imaginative, well drawn, and has a very tight story; it is also a highly emotional film that will not only make you feel, but also make you think. Miyazaki weaves his environmental message into the story, taking center stage amongst all the epic conflict, making you grow to appreciate the great outdoors even more after viewing this film. Not only that, Miyazaki shows us how awful war truly is, he makes us realize all the sacrifice and loss involved. He does not glorify the battles within this film, he shows them in a very real, almost upsetting fashion (or as real as war can be represented in a fantasy). Though Princess Mononoke is also a story of real love. The romance between the warrior Ashitaka and the wolf princess San is beautiful, and very real in how it unfolds. In the midst of all this conflict, these two opposites come together and form a force that is stronger than all.Even still Princess Mononoke is also a terrific action film. The action set pieces in this film are many, all being extremely inventive and exciting to watch. The opening battle with the possessed boar and San's attack on Iron Town are among two of the finer action sequences in the film. Of course the one that is truly the stand out battle scene is the battle between the humans and the boars. This battle is played out in a very affecting, very artistic way, and is definitely one of the more memorable sequences of the film.This film is easily one of Miyazaki's greatest. It is far more mature than any of his other films, and that might be why it's so special to me. It's a film that is different, but relishes in it, delivering a film that is not just a good animated film, but simply a terrific film in general.I give Princess Mononoke a perfect 10 out of 10!","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","TensersFloatingDisk","4 March 2006","Given all the hype surrounding Princess M., I expected to like this film a good deal more than I did.I tried to like it. Truly. Unfortunately, the producers make it extremely difficult to do so, since their primary conceit seems to have been: ""let's confuse our audience as much as we can."" The primary way they accomplish this is by having every character vacillate back and forth from protagonist to antagonist every other scene. The wolves are good guys. No, wait, they're threatening to kill the hero. Oh wait, they're trying to save the forest. Nope, they're just small-minded bigots. etc. etc.Worse than the mythic figures were the humans: ah, the people of IronTown are attacked by wolves, goodie! Oh wait, they're destroying the environment, I hate those guys! But wait, they're not as bad as these soldiers, so we sympathize again, only now they're shooting at the Princess of the forest, darn they're bad, but wait...And so on and so on. I recognize the desire to present complex characterizations and avoid the black-and-white mentality of so much fantasy work, but this quickly devolved into simple inconsistency. Eventually I just gave up and decided to hate everybody in the film, after which it became kind of bitter fun to watch them spill one another's blood across the screen (which they do in simply astonishing volumes).As for the environmental sub-text of the movie, it was not only severely undercut by all the heavy-handed side-switching mentioned above, but almost entirely buried in the morass of annoying mythological background which plagued the movie. In the last fifteen minutes, it turns out that this mythological stuff has actually been the whole crux of the movie (surprise), providing the excuse for a boatload of visual effects but leaving the central plot, as it has been heretofore presented, in the dust.Final words: confusing, inconsistent, turgid mythology punctuated by inadequately explained violence. Go read Harry Potter instead.","

The prognosis for his injury is that it will deteriorate and eventually kill him. He can be saved if he finds the cure, which will require a long quest...Pretty much your standard Hayao Miyazaki movie. Good set up, with a fair degree of intrigue. However, the intrigue dissipates quite quickly as the movie degenerates into a long, rambling adventure with no real themes emerging. Add in lack of character depth and thus lack of character engagement and you have: random plot, shallow characters, no profundities - a movie lacking in substance. So, not ideal for intelligent adults.Kid's should enjoy it, though the longish running time may hinder that.","

Yes, there's some excellent animation and enough plot for 7 films BUT, not all the animation is good, the plot isn't exactly interesting and gets real silly at times (I gave up when the tigers and boars started having conversations), and the film is WAY too long (130 minutes). Also, the dubbing of the American voices doesn't help at all. The only one who works is Billy Cudup who voices the young hero--his voice fits perfectly. Billy Bob Thornton is horrible--his Texas accent sounds a little out of place in ancient Japan! (Also his character makes no sense and disappears completely in the middle of the movie). Claire Danes makes the princess sound like a spoiled brat and Minnie Driver's English accent sound uproarious on an evil(?) Japanese queen. That's the problem, she reads her lines so unsurely I didn't know how to take them! This is definitely a movie that lost A LOT in the translation.

The only other Japanese animated films I can think of that I love just as much as this are GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES, AKIRA, SPIRITED AWAY, and GHOST IN THE SHELL. PRINCESS MONONOKE is perfection. The film is simply flawless in it's storytelling, it's animation, it's characters, and it's emotion. The film is about a boy who is cursed with a sickness that will kill him but, at the same time, gives him superhuman abilities. He ventures out of his hometown to find a cure. In the process of finding a cure, he is caught in the middle of a war between animals and humans and gets involved by the leader of the animals, a human female named Princess Mononoke. The film is an epic work of fantasy. Out of all the Fantasy films I've seen in my time, this is probably my favorite. There is so much imagination at work here with the characters and the action. At times things become overwhelming due to the epic scale and the emotion evoked in the storyline and the action. Some of the images in this film are so strange and indescribable that I can easily recommend it on the note that there are sights that you will never see anywhere else, but I don't want to make it sound like a freak show. What makes the film's bizarre images even greater is how the strength of the animation alone can carry it along with the plot in such a elegant and masterful way. It's wondrous when a person can create such images full of beauty and bizarre otherworldliness. I always love when filmmakers do that. The fact that this is animated allows these images to absorb the viewer in much simpler and extraordinary ways. At times the film is so astonishing in how it's able to carry this stuff that it is emotional. I love the film because it reminds me that the human race is capable of creating the most astonishing things. I love the human race, and it's because of films like these.","

The story takes place from the 14th to the 16th centuries. Ashitaka's tribe, the Aji, is located in the northeast of Japan. One day a wicked god from the West was going to invade the village where Ashitaka was. This wicked god was transformed from a cursed wild boar god.Seeing the evil god stepping forward, Ashitaka came forward. Although he later killed the wild boar god, he was also cursed by the evil god, and his life could not be guaranteed. In order to resolve the mystery of the curse and save himself, Ashitaka followed the instructions of the witch in his village and went to the west to find out and seek a way out.
On the way, he inquired that the guardian god of the forest, the mountain beast god, could resolve this curse, and he set off to the forest. On the way, he rescued two people who transported iron ore to the valley and met Shan for the first time. These two people were from the iron smelting plant in Abercy.In the iron workshop, he unveiled the cursed fan of the wild boar god: Abbey attacked the forest with a musket, and the wild boar god guarding the forest, the god of Nago, became a demon because of hatred after hitting her musket. That night, Shan came to attack the iron factory. She was actually the daughter of a human being raised by the white wolf god who was abandoned by humans.
Shan was in a critical situation with a few enemies, but Ashidaka was determined to save her, and he was shot for this. His life was in danger. The rescued Shan was touched by Ashidakar's sincerity and bravery. Asidakar was seriously injured, and Shan decided to take him to the forest to let the mountain beast god rescue him.
The mountain beast god rescued Ashitaka, at this time the wild boar swarms that were deeply harassed by humans decided to fight with humans to save their home forest. Shan, who loved the forest, wanted to protect the guardian of the forest and left Ashitaka. , Involved in the battle of the wild boar group and the joint army of Alberti and the samurai.In the battle between Alberti and the wild boar herd, the wild boar herd was almost wiped out. In order to find the mountain beast god, the army and the samurai army put on the wild boar skin and painted the wild boar blood to track the retreating wild boar god and Shan.
As the mountain beast god's island approached, the army surrounded the wild boar gods and Shan and attacked them. The angry wild boar god will soon become a demon, and the shan to save it will also be implicated. Ashitaka, who has just arrived, wants to save shan, but he can't help it.Seeing that the situation is irreversible, the mountain beast god overwhelmed the life of the wild boar god and thus prevented the wild boar god from becoming an evil god. At the same time, Ashitaka rescued Shan with the help of the white wolf god.
Albert West took the opportunity to shoot down the Mountain Beast God, and the White Wolf God saw it, struggling to bite off one arm of Albert West, and then died. The angry mountain beast god absorbs life to get his head back. In order to save the forest, Ashitaka and Shan finally recovered the head of the mountain beast god.The mountain beast Shenyang, who had recovered from his head and lost his head, crashed to the ground and died. With his own death, he gave new vitality to the earth in an instant.
After saving the forest, Shan still couldn't relieve her crime of destroying the forest. She chose to return to the forest. Ashitaka respected Shan's choice. The two smiled in a lush green mountain.","

We should be kind to nature, because human beings want to ""live"", maybe this is our only way out.The characters depicted in Princess Mononoke are also very delicate and profound. They are not simply good and evil. From the standpoint of human beings, She is a great leader and a humanitarian lover. From the perspective of nature, Shan Shan is a firm protector of nature and a simple girl who dares to love and hate.Nature is the god we should be awed by. In front of it, there is no right side.

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","williampsamuel","10 January 2015","Princess Mononoke is by far the best anime I have ever seen. I've seen Spirited Away, Howell's Moving Castle, Ghost in the Shell, and many others, but none equal the beauty, depth, and epic storytelling of this film. Mononoke features as many fully developed characters as the largest Hollywood ensemble production, slicker fight scenes than many martial arts flicks, larger battle scenes than most war movies, and visuals as awe-inspiring as any ever drawn. The New York Post was right on the money in calling it ""The Star Wars of animated features."" I apologize ahead of time, but there is no way I can fully convey what makes this movie great without including spoilers. Consider yourself warned.The first thing that strikes you as you watch this movie is that dozens of Japan's best animators must have spent months on ending animating this film. The line art, pencils, and coloring are flawlessly executed and richly detailed in every scene. The movements and expressions of both people and animals are perfectly lifelike, individual leaves can be seen blowing in the breeze, and at times hundreds of characters occupy the screen, accompanied by smoke and flashes of gunfire. The writhing tentacles of the boar demon must have taken dozens of hours to draw all by themselves. Even Disney would probably give in and use CGI at this point. Come to think of it, the credits did mention a small computer animation staff, but for the life of me I can't remember a single frame that looked computer generated.Then there are the people. Prince Ashitaka is one of the bravest, most skilled warriors I've seen. His proficiency with both sword and bow would do Link proud. He also possesses wisdom and empathy well beyond his years. He fights and kills when he must, but his utmost priority is to save lives. And he repeatedly risks his life to stop the fighting around him, though it brings the distrust and at times enmity of all sides.Lady Iboshi is equally fascinating. Ruthless, ambitious, utterly fearless, and possessing impeccable manners, she comes off at first glance as the perfect villain. Her position as the region's top arms manufacturer and the revelation that she was indirectly responsible for his curse do little to dispel this image. After his outburst on first meeting her, and the attempt on her life, which ended with the prince helping the wounded assailant get away, I was certain that Ashitaka would side with the wolves against Irontown. And I felt a growing dread that the filmmakers would give in to heavy handed environmentalist moralizing, a la Fern Gulley.Amazingly though, they resist this temptation, instead taking a far more nuanced approach. Yes, Lady Iboshi is ruthless. Yes, she has despoiled swaths of the surrounding forests. And yes, she is in collusion with the film's real villain, whose scheme nearly brings on the ruin of everyone. But she is also generous and loyal to those who follow her. Everything she does, good, bad, or in between is to protect her people or to honor debts owed. Despite early appearances, she's an not evil woman, but a determined leader doing what she feels that she must.But the most interesting character by far is San, the wolf princess. Raised by wolves since infancy, San believes that she is a wolf, and bears an intense hatred of humanity, to the point of becoming violent when it is pointed out that she is human. And make no mistake; San is a very violent, very tough young woman. The first time we see her, she is covered in her adoptive mother's blood, which she is sucking from a poisoned wound. This chick is hard core.With characters like these there is lots of action, and all of it is awesome. The fight scenes are fast paced and beautifully choreographed, if that's the right word to use for animation. The prince's opening clash with the boar demon is exhilarating and more than a bit frightening, and the duel between San and Iboshi is simply breathtaking in the intensity and skill displayed by both combatants. The later battle sequences are likewise stunning in their scale and violence. The charge of the boar tribe rival's the Rohirrim's charge from Return of the King in its thunderous power, and the ending is like something out of Godzilla.Any way you look at it, Princess Mononoke is a wonderful film. It's grandiose, exciting, spellbinding, filled with a rich cast of characters, and possesses a clear message about the need for balance between man and nature, and the destructive power of anger. It may be too violent for small children, and I'm sure there's a good amount of subtext that western viewers will miss, but this is a movie that has something for everyone. I would highly recommend it to all audiences.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","MrPupkin","23 October 2019","First Studio Ghibli movie to mix hand-drawn and CG-animation, resulting in a piece of art and the greatest Studio Ghibli film ever created. A masterwork with compelling characters, a fascinating story and a great message to be learned. Hayao Miyazaki's best film still manages to put many modern anime movies to shame with its amazing visuals, action packed scenes and wonderful soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi. Mononoke Hime avoids the classic black or white morality issue and deals with more powerful themes than other Ghibli movies, turning this film from something that could've easily been a children's book into a fantastic tale for people of all ages. This is, in my opinion, the best anime film of all time.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","jadentortiz","4 December 2015","Princess Mononoke is a 1997 animated film by Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. The word Mononoke is a Japanese word for specter or spirit. The film was received positively by critics and won 4 awards in Japan. A central theme of the movie is the environment and humanity's fear of the unknown. Industrialization is also a key factor as iron town wants to expand mining for iron into the forest. The forest gods do not agree with this and that is how the whole conflict starts. The story revolves around a boy Ashitaka who became cursed by a demon and must rid his curse or die. He travels to the west in search of the forest god to lift his curse. Meanwhile a group of villagers are traveling home and are attacked by the wolf clan. Ashitaka meets the wolf clan along the way and befriends them. Princess Mononoke is the adoptive daughter of the wolf god. He travels to iron town events transpire and the humans and beasts battle for the forest. Ashitaka and San (Princess Mononoke) must save the beasts and humans or suffer the destruction of both.Ashitaka has an understanding of the unknown and knows he must rid the curse he has. The people living around the forest and in iron town, are afraid of the beasts and what they don't know lurks in the forest. How they try and overcome this issue is with guns, burning down the forest, waging war with the forest animals, and killing the forest gods. They don't try and problem solve how they can fix it, they just start shooting the place up. This could be carried over into today as people don't try and solve their problems by working with others and go in head on. Wars and other problematic events occur today because of that unwillingness. Today we have people who care too much and some who don't care about the environment. The issues that Princess Mononoke discusses are still relevant today. The taking of land to expand an empire has been around for a long time. Today we have cities expanding and taking up natural land. San is an example of someone who cares about the environment and will do anything to maintain the peace of the forest and the forest gods. In order to protect the forest San goes to the iron city to kill the leader so they will stop destroying the land. She fails to kill the leader and this drives the conquest to destroy the forest to increase. Ashitaka knows that the forest is a vital part in the ecosystem. He tries to help San save the forest and stop the bloodshed. While in the iron city he takes a bullet and ""dies"" to save San. San takes him to the forest god to heal him. The forest god sees the potential within Ashitaka and brings him back to life. Ashitaka then goes to reason with both parties to save the city. A monk and the leader of the iron city follow Ashitaka back into the forest and kill the forest god. This makes a deadly goo that kills what it touches. The monk takes the head of the forest god. The god forms into a being and takes aim to reclaim his head. Ashitaka then stops the monk and gives the head back to the god. This brings balance to the world and restores the land to a healthy state. Him and San go separate ways to restore what once was. Ashitaka is the example of what people need to do today to protect what is important to them. By going on his journey he shows a motivation to protect what he cares about. He goes willingly knowing that he will not see his family again but that they will be safe. He later learns to care for the forest and does what he can to protect it. He is a strong example of if you care about something you will do anything to protect it. This is a strong character trait throughout the anime genre.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","kikiboo_8","21 January 2022","The movie had some pretty big potential. Which it didn't use. In the beginning the story seemed very compelling. The scene with the boar covered in worms chasing Ashitaka was pretty damn original. The whole idea was. I mean the poor thing was suffering so much and the curse drove him mad and killed him slowly. Ashitaka got the same curse from him and now he's supposed to find a way to lift it. He meets princess Mononoke, lady Eboshi and so on. Then the plot gets rushed, boring and uncompelling. I didn't feel any kind of connection with any of the characters, didn't empathize with them, root for them or found them interesting or relatable at all. So, I watched the whole thing more so I'd finish what I started rather than cause I actually wanted to.Point being, it really could have been much better.","

It is a good movie but I guess I had too much expectation. I'd rate it towards the bottom of Miyazaki movies. My daughter also loves Miyazaki. Her favorites are Totoro and Ponyo. And this one was fairly highly rated so we watched it together. Well, this one is neither for kids or for adults. It's like adult story told by a kid.My daughter was mortified by all the brutal beheadings and body parts flying around. My wife didn't appreciate animated women showing off their cleavages and hitting on a child. And I didn't like how literal the storytelling was. It was basically explaining everything instead of implying it for viewers to think about.The basic plot was good. I even wonder if James Cameron got the idea for Avatar from this movie. The visuals are great and I loved how much detail he put into everything. But that's about it. This movie had so much potential.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","oltmansg","2 October 2000","I suppose I am a glutton for punishment. I've had a love/hate relationship with anime for quite some time now. Despite being disappointed more often than pleasantly surprised. I keep coming  back for more for some reason. I suppose it's because I hope that sometime someone will get it right and finally mix stunning  visuals (of which there are plenty in the anime world) with a coherent plot, and an interesting story (of which there are woefully few).Princess Mononoke fits into this category quite nicely. The visuals are absolutely breathtaking. I would rate it in the same  category along with other fantastic anime like Macross Plus, Ninja Scroll, Ghost in the Shell, and Wings of Honneamise. The framerate was better than average for most anime. The only place I think they could have improved was on the behemoth night-walker spirit, which seemed a little choppy at times.The soundtrack is one of the best you'll hear. The musical score in particlar excels right through to the end of the movie. The sound effects were outstanding also. If a soundtrack CD is offered for this movie, I'll buy it in a heartbeat.Where the movie really disappoints is with the storyline. This is tragic too, because there are so many good characters on which to develop and plot devices (the tree spririts were fantastic) to use. After the first 30 minutes or so, the plot becomes incoherent, with no clear direction, and the characters sink into the not necessarily good/bad roles that has become the norm for anime.I feel that Princess Mononoke scores highly on technical merit, but really lacks when it comes to an involved, entertaining storyline. I hope that anime studios will learn from this, and in the future hire some talented writers to match their artists.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Shilo_R_A","28 October 2021","""Can nothing be done? To simply wait for death...""Princess Mononoke is the kind of film that sounds like a cool metaphor with an important message, but turns out to be much more when you dive deep into it.This movie tells the story of Ashitaka, a young warrior from a small eastern village. While defending his village from a mad demon-god, Ashitaka got cursed, and he has to travel far to the west in order to lift the curse, to save himself.But this is not what this movie is really about, and you probably know that. Princess Mononoke is about the relationship between humans and nature. It's also kinda about the climate crisis, but it's not the main thing so I'll leave it for now.Nature may bring life (""I neve knew that the deer god made the flowers bloom..."") or take them away. It may, and it does.And when we take, nature takes too. That's kind of how it works, and Miyazaki communicates this idea in a very interesting, subtler than expected way, on Princess Mononoke. The whole film is one big allegory, but the way that each character portrays a certain mindset, or the way that a single line of dialogue can add so much to this allegory is quite damn impressive.I think that the score here is solid too, the plot is - though slow a bit at times - quite interesting, and the final act is especially great. You know how much I love a strong ending.Oh, and the animation is decent too. I know that miyazaki went on to create stuff that's by far more impressive visually, but this film is still very well made, and for a relatively small budget this film looks really solid.Issues I take with this film - San's character is a little underdeveloped in my eyes. Especially her relationship with Ashitaka or Moro. Also, I feel like Miyazaki kinda shows a little bit of escapism regarding the climate change towards the end of the film, BUT. I do get that it may very possibly not be exactly what he was aiming for, and the message of the film is still quite important and is communicated in a deep way, and not through one pov only.So, that's it I guess. This film is pretty damn good, and though it has some issues it's definitely worth your time. The message is important, the allegory interesting and the film is very well made as a whole. Plus, a strong final act is alway great. I'm feeling an 8.4/10 on this one.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","lou-50","19 November 1999","""Princess Mononoke"" is pure and simply a morality tale, presented in the finest tradition of Japanese animation with such detail that it almost seems real.  This 1997 film finally made its showing here two years later with the added voiceover of well-known Hollywood stars such as Claire Dane, Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, and Gillian Anderson.  So given that pizzazz, can a film with obvious Oriental themes - the dignity of nature and the consequences of its violation by man and the enduring spirituality that makes life timeless, work on an American audience?  Yes, because ""Princess Mononoke"" skillfully orchestrates the breathtaking outdoors with its mysticism as well as coordinated battles and other action scenes to tell a story both adult and children can understand.  No, because the simplicity of presentation makes some people think it is hokey.  Additionally, love relationships, whether it is between mother and child or boy and girl, are intentionally restrained by Western standards so we feel cheated when the best romantic scene is one where the Princess chews up jerky beef before transferring it to the mouth of her Prince.  Given that, ""Princess Mononoke"" is worth the price of admission just for its well designed animation and its hair-raising suspense, even if we can't appreciate the Spirit of the Forest' and the cataclysmic forces it has on all of us.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Alcaminhante","27 July 2000","After the recent invasion of Dragon Balls and Pokemons, somehow i had in my mind the idea that this was going to be another commercial crappy manga for kids. Despite that i decided to go see it and check for myself why the movie reviewers where praising this movie so much, rating it FIVE stars out of five.Unfortunately, in my country, (Portugal), this movie is playing only once a day in the early afternoons. As usual in Portugal, animation is treated all equal. Animated movies >little kids, and so this movie plays here in the few theaters that bought it (4 ), right about after lunch in little children time slot. What is realy amazing, is that i´m sure the Portuguese distributors of PRINCESS MONONOKE even saw the movie, because if they did, they would notice, (or perhaps not), that this is not a movie for little children. First because there are some very explicit gore scenes, where arms and heads are chopped off occasionally  along the whole movie, there´s violence (and i don´t mean just action violence), reference to more adult themes, (plenty of the female characters are ex-prostitutes) and a few more details like this.I don´t have any problem in taking any kid to see a story like this, but i´m sure there are a bunch of conservative parents out there, that by this time have just forbidden their kids of watching Pokemon, thinking that somehow Mangas are all the same.But PRINCESS MONONOKE isn´t a kids movie just because of this. Above all ,it´s because of its plot and storyline wich gets to complex for little kids to follow. One thing that amused me a lot, was watching some kids in the front row, totally confused because they couldn´t figure out who were the bad guys ! Others were totally bored and only paid real atention to the movie in the action scenes complaining all the time the movie was boring and not very easy to understand.In fact, actually, this movie has probably the best screenplay currently displayed in any movie right now. I wish i could find a non-animated movie out there at this moment with a screenplay capable of touching this one in quality and complexity. Not Mission Impossible for sure. ( And then it´s the animation films who are considered ,stuff for kids ! :-) )I won´t get in the story of PRINCESS MONONOKE because part of pleasure of watching this movie, is going to see it without any clue whatsoever. I´m just going to say, it´s a very ecological movie, set in medieval china (i guess), and where spirits and anything magical, is treated like just another thing made by Mother Nature and not like some supernatural characters that we usualy find everywhere. There are no real heroes in here, and no real bad guy in sight. It´s a slow paced movie, with a brilliant animation, a very intimist plot, a little bit of crude violence (but depicted in a very ""natural"" way, not just there to show off), excelent characters, fantastic landscapes and a pretty good soundtrack that goes almost unoticed. And this movie is BIG. It´s not your regular 75/80 minutes for kids. PRINCESS MONONOKE plays for about 130 minutes.If you like Manga, (and i don´t mean Dragon Ball), real Manga like AKIRA, or WINGS OF HONEAMISE, you can´t miss this movie, because it´s actualy a brilliant movie. Definetely one of the best this year. If you are a fan ,of an old Manga movie called WARRIORS OF THE WIND, then PRINCESS MONONOKE is from the same director, and the style is more or less the same. I read this director is not going to make any more manga movies , (WHY?!!), and that this was his goodbye to animation features. :-(Well let me tell you, this is what we can call, going out in style ! Brilliant movie, (just not for every audiences).Don´t miss it.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","thousandisland","9 May 2001","I don't understand what all the commotion is about with this film.. Yes, it is beautiful to look at and has great characters and artistry, but it's so hard to follow!  It suffers the same deadfall that many, perhaps MOST anime films do.. The plot is just too confusing.  It starts out ok, even the middle of the film is engaging, but by the end of it there is utter confusion:  Too many characters fighting for too many different reasons.  I am even a science major, an adult, and an animation connoisseur, and this film stumps me.  There are all of these different parties going after the forest spirit, but also fighting eachother.  The forest spirit is ambiguous itself, friendly one moment, and then dangerous when its head is cut off. Warriors want to keep the head as a trophy, so they're stirring up trouble for everyone. There are the metal workers who are doing their own thing but inadvertently creating demons when animals get shot.  Sometimes.  Depending on the species of animal which is infected with the bullet. I think.  Then you have the boar people who are fighting everybody and trying to protect the forest.. And the princess and the wolves, who are really aloof and not on anybody's side.  And then there's Ashitaka, who is mixed up with all of them and has the demon infection himself and wants to find a cure. And we have to hurry up and reunite the forest spirit with its severed head, or we're all doomed.Get all that?  Lovely artwork from the characters to the landscape to the action... Breathtaking scenery and mysticism, but a little too muddled to come off triumphant.  This film would be excellent if it were more explanatory, or just had its plot streamlined a bit.  Anime fans may get it, but I think the average American viewer will be up the creek without a paddle.  Or maybe on the shore WITH a paddle.  Anyway, I'm getting dizzy just trying to sort it out.  A for effort, though..","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","perni","23 August 2002","I have always been interested in the field of animation, but one major chunk of the industry has alluded me for quite some time. That would be anime, a genre of animation that continues to be insanely popular in the East but widely regarded as geek-fare over here in the States. My interest rose upon hearing about Hayao Miyazaki and his wonderful films that have broken box office records in Japan. The first film I saw that was directed by him was Kiki's Delivery Service, a charming movie with a leisurely pace and appealing characters. Princess Mononoke is a very different beast, however, and is not a kid friendly fable by any means. It's a very complicated war epic that combines mythology and politics to make one amazing adult film. Sure, there is some great comic relief, but there are also decapitated soldiers, demon boars who puke buckets of blood, and characters who get shot point blank. In short, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU SHOW TO THE KIDS YOU'RE BABYSITTING WHILE YOU GO AND PIG OUT ON PIZZA HOT POCKETS. The only people I see watching Princess Mononoke are mature fans of animation who can handle some gore and a deep, convoluted plot. Your basic summary of the movie's story might go something like this: A prince kills a rampaging demon that tries to attack his village, and in the process receives a deadly cures that will slowly poison his mind and body. He must now journey deep into the forest and try to find a cure, but along the way he meets a large cast of characters who are at war with one another. There's the samurai, who want the ore of Iron Town, a soft spoken warrior who guards that town, and the creatures of the forest, who are led by Princess Mononoke. At over 2 hours long, you can trust that this is just a small piece of the complete tale. The ending is a classic moment involving destruction and rebirth, and is one that cannot be missed. My favorite character had to be the Forest Spirit, a creature with bird-like legs, elk antlers, and the face of a human. I won't say anymore. Just see it, and then check out other Miyazaki flicks like Spirited Away, My Neighbor Tortoro, and Castle in the Sky. ****/****","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","mbhgkmsgg","14 November 2020","Beautiful. Honest. Startling. Those are some of the words that I would use to begin to describe this masterpiece. Princess Mononoke is a brutally honest look at human nature and man's fight against what we don't understand.This movie depicts our relationship with nature more accurately than I would like to admit. Eiter we want to own it or control it, or we fear it because we don't understand it. This is how we have always been, now perhaps more than ever before. We don't care what happens to what is around us as long as it benefits us. And if don't understand it we want to destroy it. Princess Mononoke is, of course, a fantasized version of that brutality, but it doesn't mean that the message isn't accurate.Although this film is full of ugliness it is also exceptionally beautiful. What has never ceased to amaze me is the feel of these films. Achieved with emotional and beautiful music and gorgeous visuals, it's hard not to love every moment and every scene. No matter how difficult or dark a moment in this film is, there is always beauty in it too.It's hard to find any fault in this film. Sure, the story might drag for a bit too long in the middle but you'll forget about that in no time. It's also quite a violent film. Something that might put some people off. Personally, I thought that it was necessary for this film and it drove the message home very effectively. That's something that I have always loved about Miyazaki's films. No matter how crazy or weird his worlds are, the message always shines through brightly. What's more, the message is always important and good.I'm by no means an expert when it comes to Studio Ghibli or Hayao Miyazaki films. I have seen some them over the years and they have always stood out to me from the sea of movies. They have always stunned me with their beauty and made me reflect on the message they convey. And Princess Mononoke is no different.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","IkuharaKunihiko","4 August 2005","Medieval Japan. Ashitaka has been infected with a strange disease when he killed a mysterious demon boar covered with leaches that attacked his village. On his journey to find a cure he meets lady Eboshi, a female leader of a town exploiting the forest and fighting with creatures protecting the nature. The leader of those creatures is San, princess Mononoke...When I first went to see ""Princess Mononoke"" I expected a gentle, romantic, dreamy fairy tale. Was I surprised when I saw the raw and brutal story! This is in my opinion Miyazaki's most violent film, but non the less, it really is an impressive anime. I wouldn't necessary put it on the 102. place on the IMDb's top 250 films, but I admit it has something in it that fascinates me.------- The most clever aspects of the story are the ones about how lady Eboshi is tricking her people into helping her exploit the Forest, while at the same time dismissing the wolf's revenge attacks as something illogical. Also, just watch the sequence where San is being captured inside a sea of red leaches on a demon boar: the part where Ashitaka jumps into that bunch of leaches trying to save San from them, but is being catapulted into the water, is pure dark poetry and romance in one. Also, there's the spectacular image of the gigantic deer god's body walking through the hills.Still, Miyazaki made a lot of mistakes. The middle of the film is repetitive and too long making only the end exciting, the characters are somewhat wooden and the whole mood of the anxious world is way over the top. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone younger than 16. Also, I miss a lot of humor Miyzaki had in his previous films. I got the idea he made ""Mononoke"" just because he was in his depressive ""I hate the world"" phase. All in all, the epic ""Princess Mononoke"" deserved it's success( it's average critic's grade on rotten-tomatoes.com is 7.7/10 ), but in the long term there was still something missing in it's story. What? Just watch ""Being there"" or ""The Graduate"" and you'll see what.Grade: 6/10","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","datautisticgamer-74853","29 December 2017","Like with My Neighbor Totoro, this film was playing at the Music Box Theater near me as a New Year's celebration. Thus, I spent the better part of today's afternoon viewing it there. Judging by my rating, you may see where I'm going with this...I was impressed with how this film was presented in its original Japanese language, just subtitled so English speakers could comprehend. It also limits the amount that it can be censored by dubs, which I'm sure other Studio Ghibli movies went through when Fox and Disney dubbed them in the 90s. Anyway, the story is probably where my hardest judgment on this movie is. It can be hard for the common family to understand with its supposed subplots, but they are all written in a way that pristinely intertwine. Just when the second act starts to turn dull (if I had to downgrade this to a 9, it would probably be for that reason, though it doesn't go there), it hoists upon us the epic, heart-stopping third act that had me literally on the edge of my seat in awe. It's an experience I had never really gone through before with a Studio Ghibli film. The music really bolstered this movie, too, since it makes up for not being too tear-jerking with mixing to perfection with the mood and setting, plus beautiful lyrics portrayed by Yoshikazu Mera. The characters contribute to this being a really somber and edgy movie, definitely the perfect contrast to the silliness and light-heartedness of My Neighbor Totoro; they are written in such a way that their overall motives possess several complexities, which admittedly did have me slightly confused. It just goes to show how important the name Hayao Miyazaki is in animation as a whole. Giving us all this is animation that is blowout by anime standards at the time. Glorious environments and character designs come with some of the best incorporation of CGI to hand drawn I have seen in a movie so far. I probably could not make my admiration for Studio Ghibli's animation more lucid than here.You will take something out of this film when you watch it. It is the best anime film I have seen yet, and I want to ensure that more families, especially ones who are ready to expose their children to such edginess, and otaku can view this film. If there is an anime film that one must see before they perish, this is it. I cannot recommend this film enough in a review like this, so stop reading and find a way that you can view it. Once again, Studio Ghibli, I want to thank you for capitalizing on what Akira introduced to us 9 years ago; it was completely worth it.","

And this film is.It became the highest-grossing film in Japan ever upon release. Even after 20 years, it's still in the top six. The film in the top spot nowadays? Spirited Away.I love Spirited Away. It is one of the greatest films of all time. I will watch it twenty more times in the future, and if I ever have kids, I'll make sure to show it to them once they get old enough to appreciate it.But this film is better.Why? It has a lot to do with the kind of stories the films tell. They both tell their stories extremely well, but Spirited Away is more of a small-scale, conventional story about a girl finding her way home. Princess Mononoke is a grand epic about war, human nature, inevitability, resilience, philosophy, and culture.The best description I can come up with is that this film would Japan's version of The Iliad if The Iliad was as sprawling and beautiful as The Lord of the Rings. But that description does not really do it justice. This is a movie I can spend hours discussing and analyzing from every angle. Even if I saw it a thousand times, I don't think I'd ever get tired of it.Our lead is Prince Ashitaka, who in defending his village had his hand cursed by a demon. He must leave his people, who are rapidly dying out, and ride west to in an attempt to get his hand cured by the forest spirit. But there is a war raging between the forest and man, and he must attempt to negotiate a peace between the two sides if he hopes to get healed. He meets up with San, the titular Princess Mononoke, who was raised by wolves after being abandoned by her human parents. She has a nasty hatred for all things human, but she ends up falling in love with Ashitaka, and the two of them put their lives on the line to bring peace and stop man and beast alike from being torn to pieces.Technically, this is an environmental movie, but it's not preachy or one-sided or simplistic or even biased in favor of nature. It simply presents the two sides and lets the viewer think what they will. Even if this movie were bad, I would give it immense respect for that. Whereas lesser movies are afraid of nuance, this film is built upon it.The characters are a great example of this. There is no real 'bad guy' in this film, just forces and players and people with ambitions and people with understandable prejudices. No character is perfect, but every character is relatable, resulting in a piece of complex and nuanced art.And it is most certainly is art. If there were ever a movie that deserved to be calm, it's this one. The story is electric. The animation is gorgeous. The music is some of the best I've heard in any film. The emotions these 120 or so minutes evoke in me are so numerous and complex that I couldn't hope to list them here. This film would be worth traveling halfway around the world to see. That's not something I often say.This film manages to start out great, get better as it goes along, and finish out on a high note. The last twenty minutes are some of the greatest I've ever seen in any film. It takes all the energy and themes that have been present throughout the film and kicks them into hyperdrive. It's so overwhelming, I don't turn off the film until the credits are done rolling. That's how long it takes for me to even begin to unpack the rush that has unfolded before me.What makes it perfect is that the second credits theme, a replaying of The Legend of Ashitaka, is simply amazing. It a perfect piece of music. It's one of my five favorite pieces of all time. Whenever it randomly comes in my playlist, I get chills down my back. When it comes up in the ends credits, I collapse into a glorious fit of emotions and sensual overload and glorious euphoria.From its visuals to its storytelling to its presentation, this is the definitive animated film. It is superb. It is beautiful. It is a masterpiece.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","jackthepgl","1 September 2023","Princess Mononoke is one of the reasons why Studio Ghibli hit the mark on it's predecessor much like Spirited Away later on, this one is an absolute masterpiece and just when I am doing this review, I'm just gonna say that the director who directed before he directed Spirited Away, it is Hayao Miyazaki. He works for Studio Ghibli along with two others like Toshio Suzuki and Isao Takahata. They're the ones who are responsible for making animated films beautiful and impeccable entertaining those who are fans of anime. Now that I got that out of the way, let's continue on. An Emishi village is attacked by a hideous demon and the last of the Emishi who is a prince called Ashitaka, kills it before it reaches the village, but it manages to grasp his arm and curses him. The curse grants him superhuman strength, but it also causes a scar-like mark that will surround him, cause him pain, and eventually kill him. The villagers discover that the demon was a boar god and the wise woman tells Ashitaka that he may find a cure in the western lands where the demon came from, so he goes out on the journey to find a cure to cure his arm before he dies. Along the way he comes across a young woman named San played by Claire Danes, who was raised by the wolves and feels hatred for humans. Yeah, a woman who is raised by wolves and has hatred for humans. You can see where this is going whilst you kept watching but all I can say is, she's a human too. The only way he can get the cure from his arm is from the Great Forest Spirit who is a deer-like animal god. After the day I watched Spirited Away, I was actually going to go for the ones that are highly rated which of course being Spirited Away itself which is why it's being one of the more impeccable ones that are on that category. That being said is like I said before if you have your own account from many movie websites you will see many lists of highly rated movies you've seen and haven't seen. You cannot go wrong. Despite being a PG film, some of the scenes that can be quite brutal. Well, not to worry, at least they have their uncle's with them. Hahaha. If you're looking at the environment of the message that it contains and you're thinking the same thing like ""Did I ever hear this message before?"" Yeah, like you're thinking about man and nature. And like you're thinking the same story like thinking about this as the Japanese Pocahontas, the Japanese FernGully: The Last Rainforest, the Japanese Dances with Wolves and the Japanese Avatar. Well, I think you guys are having with your head. Next! To be very frank here, this is not the case. There is no character that is considered an antagonist. The way it tells the story is astonishingly extraordinary. Princess Mononoke is absolutely one of the more impeccable animated films and much like the ones I've seen so far when I was a kid and adult which are nostalgic and much like Spirited Away however, this is one of the more powerful films I have ever seen period and that's saying something. This'll be like Star Wars of anime even when you're looking at engaging characters, impeccably beautiful animation and an epic story. For any anime fan, animation fan and film buffs, this is an absolute must-watch. It has every right to be an epic masterpiece and so many who are looking for something powerful and something more engaging, then seriously go see this movie right away. It is everything you want in anime. As much as I love Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke is the absolute spectacle of animation heaven.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","bellino-angelo2014","28 April 2021","Before I go into discussing the movie, I have to point out that before I saw PRINCESS MONONOKE I had never seen an Hayao Miyazaki before and I wanted to begin with this one. It's among his lesser movies but it was ok for me as an introduction.The movie is set in feudal Japan. In the beginning young prince Ashitaka protects his village and kills a huge demon spider. A injury infects his arm and so he has to travel for finding a cure and a monk talks about him of the great forest spirit. In the village he finds Lady Eboshi who is cutting down the trees and kills the forest's animals. Her major objective is to cut off the head of Okkoto, the forest spirit. She is opposed by the animals and by Princess Mononoke.I have seen the movie in the English dubbed version since I hadn't studied Japanese and for dubbing the characters they picked some famous stars of the 1990s-2000s' movies (such as Jada Pinkett Smith, Billy Bob Thornton, Gillian Anderson, Keith David who also narrates the movie, Minnie Driver and Claire Danes) and it has quite great animation for its time. However at times felt a bit too long and it should have been trimmed of at least 30 minutes as at times I even felt bored. But in the end, I kinda liked it mostly for its message.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","FlorisV","2 May 2003","I have seen plenty of Anime films and have mixed feelings about all of them. This one is no exception. Most Anime suffer from vague or erratic plots. Altho this film was actually relieving in that part, it still could have had a more tight plot because it was sometimes confusing, there were so many enemies the humans in the forest were fighting against. The animals, the forest spirit, the wolf girl, the demons, the other human tribe...a little bit more focus would have been nice. The movie is over 2 hours long, which is pretty exceptional for animated films, and in this case too long.Good about this anime was the a-typical hero who kept hoping for peace. Also, typically anime, no distinction between good or bad, just opposing forces who get in each others way. It's a good tale about the destructive force of hatred, in the form of leech-like demons. The animation is top-notch. Altho I'm not the biggest fan of the particular drawing style, it is original. No huge eyes or cheap, lazy animations here!I give it a 7,5/10","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","cbentrott","3 February 2023","STORY: The movie isn't really centered around princess Mononoke, so that's kind of misleading. It's more focused on a poisoned warrior who is sent away from his hometown. The whole movie seems to be a metaphor for deforestation, industrialization and environmentalism. While the movie gets the point across, it's a bit on the nose. Along the way, there is endless creativity with characters and scenery, which is refreshing and reminds me of the true capabilities of anime. Overall it's a compelling enough story but not really surprising or eye opening.ACTING: The English dubs of the movie were honestly my biggest qualm. I feel like Minnie driver and billy bob thorntons voices did not match the vibe of the characters at all. It was distracting. I recommend watching the movie in its original language with subtitles.","

Grave of the Fireflies is a rough one, and I will immediately go and write a review on it after this one. Anyway.Mononoke Hime is a powerful movie, and I have seen it countless times. Unlike Grave, it is extremely watchable and approachable. The story isn't subtle, but neither is it simplistic. There is no 'bad guy' in this story as everyone is open and upfront with our hero, an unbiased observer, we can quickly learn that everyone has relatively decent reason for what they do.Still everyone is consumed with the fervor of war that even poisons the land itself, and we the lucky viewer get to watch a man who barely remembers the war, but did know its effects. All of his best works speak on and condemn war, and I can respect a man who is so vocal and honest about the horrors and destruction it brings.Not his best telling of the story, but definitely the easiest and most enjoyable to watch. If you don't know who the man is. Do yourself a favor and start here.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","benjamin_lappin","24 July 2006","Complex, simple, emotive, stark, bleak and truly brilliant, Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke is a work, not only of animated art, but truly a landmark in cinematic achievement. Miyazaki, first bit the conflicted notion of human nature versus Mother Earth in his 1986 work of Nausicaa of The Valley of The Wind and truly brought this issue to the fore in many a persons mind. Mononoke, is the defining glory, capsulating over ten years of thought and hard effort. It is intrinsically deep, and powerfully moving, with the notion and human sensibility of love, being the driving force, and, like in many a Miyazaki movie, is the answer to the problems. Compassion and understanding, key humanitarian traits, that we as a species often take for granted, and fail to utilise. After suffering infection and contracting a fatal disease from a dieing Shisigami, or demon, Ashitaka our films major protagonist, sets off on a journey to travel far to the west, leaving behind his native clan and position of prince to discover the source and cause of an old gods transformation into demon. Driven by determination and honesty his search brings him to Iron Town, and a sacred Forest, where he must view an on going feud with ""unclouded eyes"" and bring peace to a region, so fraught with hate and war. Paragraphic summaries, however, do not credit this film nearly enough. It is a landmark film, and while Akira alerted the world to the presence of anime, it was Mononoke that smashed through into the mainstream to enable this joyous art form to be enjoyed in the West. Princess Mononoke encapsulates the very essence of what it is that makes us human, yet Miyazaki understands there are two sides to every coin. He does not skirt over the issue, that we as a race have the ability to destroy, to act for our own selfish needs, instead he forces the issue, while concurrently highlighting that we also have potential. The ability to make things right, is buried deep within our psyche, it is intrinsic to humanity and the differential between us and animals. He shows if we cling onto our ethics and morees we shall prevail. A must for any fan cinema.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","lucianomarzo92","10 November 2015","Princess Mononoke is, by far, the best animated movie I have ever seen. From the very beginning, it captures the viewer's imagination and continues to captivate even as its length exceeds the two-hour mark. The film is well-known for its environmental message and stunning animation, but it deserves equal praise for its well-drawn characters, dynamic action sequences, and compelling narrative.Princess Mononoke tells the story of Ashitaka, a courageous warrior who, soon into the movie, battles a cursed boar god on a rampage in his homeland. Ashitaka is able to slay the beast, but just before he does, it latches onto him and afflicts him with its curse.In an effort to lift the curse, which he soon finds is deadly, Ashitaka heads west. Along the way, he discovers several mystical creatures in the forest, one of them being the beautiful San, a young girl who lives among wolves and despises humans, yet who must somehow reconcile her antagonism to mankind with her own humanity and her fondness for Ashitaka. After emerging from the woods, Ashitaka becomes acquainted with the workers at a mining colony whose weapons, he learns, have inflicted this curse upon him.Finding himself in a conflict between the workers of the mining colony, who wish to advance their civilization at the expense of the natural world, and the forest gods, who have declared all humans as the enemy, Ashitaka must choose between fighting alongside the forest gods as well as San, whom he cares deeply for, and defending his own kind.In a riveting war between man and beast, the creatures of the forest are left with no choice but to retaliate against the humans' progressively hostile and encroaching way of life. An epic battle ensues, one that, while rooted in the fantasy genre, is surprisingly relevant to the world at large. In its depiction of the disconnect between civilization and nature, the film possesses true allegorical significance as, even amid great chaos and suffering, it contains rare moments of healing and peace.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","willeasyer","20 July 2020","A true masterpiece that contrastes Miyazaki's genius. For me this film represents life with its ambivalence, like true life seen on a microscopic level there's no good or bad, no final Victim or offender since everything is a matter of perception. And princess mononoke shows this perfectly by not setting any true antagonists. Since all the sides of this film are doing what they're doing for a convincing reason, for their survival and ishitaka serves as the mediator in the middle of this storm trying to find harmony. It's also more relevant then ever because the way it addressed industrialization and its desastrous effect on earth, the human thrust for more resources will lead to his end, and our stiving to survive might be, ironically the reason of our extinction. The film is very savage, brutal and dark, it's definitely not a kids film because i don't see a kid comprehending it. Still the animation is stunning, the details, the colors the movements this movie is a work of art, and it's really a statement of how animation can provide a complexe and solid substance that live action features can't. This movie will wow you, and honestly we need it now more then ever before.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Nigel St. Buggering","2 November 2003","Not only better than anything you're likely to see from the Disney school of factory filmworks, but quite possibly THE best animated film ever made. The sheer imagination, artistry, and detail in every frame of this work is breathtaking. I applaud Miramax for leaving the American release unedited, both for length and content.Of course, serious fans of Japanese animation will be watching the subtitled version in the original Japanese language.  But given that the majority of American viewers will go with the default dub, a few comments on that version are in order.  The voices are a mixed bag; Danes and Crudup are merely adequate; nothing any competent voice-actor couldn't have pulled off, but a bit lacking in passion at times.  When emotion is expressed, Danes can come off a bit on the whiny side. Thornton's southern accent, though he tries to conceal it, is a bit distracting set among the visuals of historical Japan. Minnie Driver and Gillian Anderson are both quite good, however, and bring great gravity and dimension to their roles. Flawed as it is, it still stands as one of the best dub jobs imported anime has to offer (though not up to the standard of the excellent Akira dub on the special edition DVD).Thematically, this is like a return to Miayazaki's roots.  Its elements of man's declaration of war on the environment, and the environment subsequently fighting back are reminiscent of his first film, Nausicaa.  Of course, the animation, breathtaking background work, and sheer attention to detail bring a level of beauty that Nausicaa couldn't match in its day. Also worth noting is composer and longtime Miyazaki collaborator Joe Hisaishi, who presents one of the best works of his career here.For fans of Miyazaki, the brilliance of this film will not come as a shock, but for everyone else, it should be quite an eye-opener. Just don't show it to your children expecting a Happy Meal cross-over with cute sidekicks and musical numbers.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","dwpollar","13 September 2009","1st watched 9/12/2009 – 4 out of 10 (Dir- Hayao Miyazaki): Complex and slow-moving battle between humans and the forest gods didn't really play that well to me. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I'm not that in tune with the Japanese culture, but I just have to call things as how I see them and this animated movie by famed director Miyazaki didn't cut it for me. I think the main problem is that he didn't make us care for the characters involved and any movie that misses this part, I usually don't recommend. Miyazaki definitely winds an inventive story with unique animation and interesting demons and creatures as he usually does but the heart comes across missing. The story is about a group of humans who want to take the forest back from the animal gods who currently inhabit it and sometimes cause havoc with they turn into demons. This situation occurred early on and the prince of the story becomes infected to the point of having a curse on him that will eventually cause him to die. He's sent west to a forest area to hopefully get cured by the Deer God. He then meets up with Princess Mononoke, who is a half-human, half-wolf protector of the forest and tries to combine with her to help the cause, eventually. Battles ensue, and we do end up getting a happy ending – which we knew we'd see eventually, but two hours of the preparation for it was too much for me. I think the purpose of the story was to get us to see how we need to protect the forest, which I think we know, but the slow moving narrative ruins the purpose. So, a beautiful film again by the director but this one didn't hit home.","

This was the subtitled version and I really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, Film 4 chose to show the dubbed version of ""Princess Mononoke"", presumably because it was broadcast in a prime time slot. Despite a script treatment by talented fantasy author Neil Gaiman, the dialogue was pretty lame in places. Some of the so-called voice talent was pretty poor as well. Minnie Driver must have literally phoned her performance in as Lady Eboshi, her voice registering as much emotion as an automated response. Jada Pinkett Smith sounded pretty incongruous as a Japanese iron worker and Billy Bob Thornton just didn't work as the sort-of villain. I enjoyed what I could understand of the plot and the imagery and production design were wonderful. I'd give the original Japanese version (subtitled in English) an 8 but the American dubbing drags ""Princess Mononoke"" down to 6.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","the_horned_owl","14 April 2016","If I had to summarize this movie in a few words, I would say – Breathtaking, Magnificent, and Brilliant. It is one of my top ten favorite films. One of the many things that make this film great is the story. The film is set up in the Iron Age in ancient Japan when the humans used to live in harmony with nature. But the discovery of Iron and selfish nature of humans led to the mass production of weapons which altered this balance. Princess Mononoke is a movie about Nature versus Humans. It also takes elements from Japanese myths and folklore and shows us the great ancient Japanese culture.The opening scene of Princess Mononoke is jaw-dropping. In the beginning, we see a strange creature and thousands of snakes (or whatever it was) coming out of his whole body. This strange creature goes berserk and tries to wreak havoc upon a nearby village. A young lad named Ashitaka tries to stop him from going to the village and send him back to the forest but things go wrong and Ashitaka kills the Creature. The strange snakes grab Ashitaka's hand and leave a mark before vanishing into thin air. It turns out that the creature was a giant Boar who turned into a Demon God. He was cursed and the curse of the Demon God was now transferred to Ashitaka.They find a metal piece in the remains of the Boar and come to know that someone shot the boar with a gun and that is why his agony and hate for humans turned him into a Demon God. Ashitaka, knowing that he has only a few days to live, goes out on a journey to find the person who shot the Boar and was responsible for this heinous act. This journey leads him to the west. There he meets Lady Eboshi who rules a piece of land called Ironworks and was responsible for the Boar's death and Ashitaka's curse. She has thousands of workers working under her. She knows how to make gunpowder and weapons which were responsible for the Boar's death. She does not hesitate to kill anyone who tries to stop her. She wants to rule the forest but is she a bad person? You will have to decide for yourselves because Miyazaki does not let you judge the characters easily.Ashitaka also meets Princess Mononoke or Mononokehime – a wolf-girl, born human and raised by wolves. She despises humans because she thinks that humans are filthy, selfish and pathetic creatures. She has vowed to kill the humans and take back the land of Ironworks that once belonged to the forest. She is always looking for the ways to kill Lady Eboshi and her people. Now what happens, you will have to watch that for yourselves. I am not going to spoil the film for you.This is just the basic plot of the film and let me tell you that the storyline is much more complex than this. There are so many characters and subplots and all the characters are well developed. Ashitaka's character has the proper depth, warmth, kindness, wisdom and courage whereas San's character is developed as an angry soul who just wants revenge. Lady Eboshi's character is given different personalities so you won't be able to judge her. You will also get to see the Deer God AKA the Forest God, The Spirits of the Forest, Humans, Wolves, Villagers, Boars, Apes and other creatures. Princess Mononoke is a story about how messing up with nature can lead to devastating results and it delivers the message successfully. The story is epic and the scale is huge, but the storytelling is what makes it brilliant. Miyazaki takes you to this great journey where you can feel everything. Any other director would not be able to achieve such depth and beauty. Miyazaki had a great understanding of animated films and that is why the people at Pixar and Disney worship him and see him as their idol.The animation work in Princess Mononoke is hand drawn and the result is breathtaking. The scenes that take place in the forest are outstanding. Each and every frame is having great details and beautiful colors. They pop out of the screen and make you want to live in the world you are seeing. At the top of that, the 3D rendering adds more depth and beauty to the handmade drawings. You don't just see the world of Princess Mononoke, you experience it and live in it during the whole runtime.The score of Princess Mononoke is one of the best scores I have ever heard in a film (The Lord of The Rings and Princess Mononoke are my favorite). I have seen this film more than 5 times and I cry every time I listen to the Theme. Joe Hisaishi, you are a genius. Overall, Princess Mononoke is a once in a lifetime experience. I loved it the first time I watched it. Then I listened to the OST and watched it again and loved it even more. I love it more and more every time I watch it. So it is a kind of movie that grows on you after multiple viewings. I was not a lucky guy because I couldn't watch it on big screen but I seriously want to watch this in theaters even if it costs a hefty amount. You cannot go wrong with Miyazaki, can you? May his soul Rest in Peace.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","sme_no_densetsu","1 October 2008","""Princess Mononoke"" tells the story of a young man's journey to seek a cure for a curse that will eventually transform him into a demon. When he finds what he's been looking for he also finds himself in the middle of a struggle between the forces of nature and industrialization.The story is highly interesting and artfully told in a mature manner. The mythology makes for a highly imaginative story that is nevertheless eminently accessible. I have no idea what kids would make of it but, as an adult, I found it much more satisfying than the usual animated fare from America.I originally watched the movie with the English dubbing done by Disney/Miramax. At the time, my only complaint was that Billy Bob Thornton was badly miscast. Now, having watched the film with the original Japanese dialogue, I can't see myself wanting to go back to the English version. I watched a few clips afterward and the English dialogue just seemed forced and, at the same time, too Americanized.Visually, the film is splendid. The scenery is often quite beautiful and the action is generally well animated. Musically, the film is decent but not especially remarkable.In the end, when you consider the whole package (animation, voice acting, storyline, etc...) I think that ""Princess Mononoke"" makes a strong case for being Miyazaki's best film, though I admit that I haven't seen all of them (yet). This is definitely a must-see and not just for fans of animation.","

The story features a protagonist who spends most of the story watching events he can't control; a town inhabited by vigorous ex-prostitutes, lepers, and useless men, led by a fearless warrior queen but whose future depends on environmental destruction; awesome, but vengeful and frequently misguided gods; a girl raised by wolves who hates humans; and various squabbling animals. Even the villain of the piece (and this is surely an obvious parable for own own world) is less a figure of evil but rather a buccaneering adventurer who puts his own self interest above the greater good. At first, watching a version dubbed into English, I was put off by the non-Japanese voices; but in time, I fell into the world portrayed anyway. And when, near the end, with their fates hanging in the balance, the hero puts his arm around the heroine, I found it strangely moving in a way that I didn't expect to feel about what is, after all, just a drawing.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","stamper","30 April 2005","Generally I am a real fan of animated films and since Hayao Miyazaki's films seem to be of very high quality I recently felt to give one of his films a try despite not being too keen on Asian anime. The only film I really liked was Vampire Hunter D to be honest and I can assure you that I've seen my share of Manga 'classics' (Akira and Ghost in the shell). I had a feeling though that Miyazaki's films would be more mainstream Hollywood style, since he has become something of a trade name since making this film and the academy award winning Spirited Away. After seeing this film, I was somewhat disappointed. Despite the fact that the film had some of the makings of a great adventure film, I just could not get used to the many fantasy; god/demon elements. From the start I felt that the films core the film had a dangerous equilibrium, which it managed to maintain during the first hour. The first hour was pretty exciting and interesting but in the second hour the weight on the 'boring' scale just got bigger and bigger. It was not as if Miyazaki did a bad job directing, but I felt that he put too much weight on the whole moral/mystical part of the film where more emphasis on the action would have made the film tighter. Maybe though it wasn't the emphasis alone, I also felt that some of the scenes were excruciatingly long. Or maybe it is safe to say that I'm not into the whole Asian 'spirit thing'. I mean I didn't like The Ring or Ju-On one bit and I didn't care much for this one either. The only thing I actually can appreciate in Asian (specifically Japanese) films is the amount of violence they use and the way in which it is often comic. There were a couple of instances in this film as well where I felt the violence was so over the top that it became funny. Too bad that isn't enough to keep a film interesting for 128 minutes. Miyazaki should have kept this one standard Disney-length (with a maximum of 85 minutes).5,25 out of 10 post scriptum: the English subs were really bad, cause last time I checked 'arigato' meant ""Thank you."" and not ""Good luck.""","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Rebochan","25 June 2001","Yes, you read that right.  And the irony is that Disney brought it over.  It bombed thanks to them, because they realized that the movie was not typical kiddie krap-no songs, the cute creatures don't even talk (they click and fortunatly don't distract), and there's no hit-you-over-the-head moral in it.  Simply put, this is the best movie ever made, animation or otherwise, and Disney couldn't handle that.The characters in this film have incredible depth that even live-action films don't attain.  There's no characters that are outright good or bad. Eboshi at first glance would be the haughty villainess, but while she does commit evil by killing the gods, she also does great good by buying up the contracts of women forced to work in brothels and caring for lepers without even fearing for their illness.  San, whose name is the ""Princess Mononoke"" of the title (Trivia: Mononoke means ""Ghost"" a name that shows the depth that Hayao Miyazaki uses in his films), while she is trying to save the forest, is quite bloodthirsty.  The gods, who protect the forest, are also very warlike, and despise humans.  The fact that there is no real line of good or evil in the movie is what makes it so powerful.That is not to say the animation isn't impressive.  They pushed the limits with this one-the final sequence with the mutated Deer God is so real you forget that your watching a series of drawings that are only an illusion of motion.  The worm demon-gods would be impossible to create in live-action-only the realm of animation make them seem plausible.This movie proves what animation can do, and also shows a sad fact-while animated films have been around for about a century, their potential has been severely overlooked to the point where the most crude of drawings and pointless of plots are considered to be ""art"" and are relegated simply to the realm of ""mindless kids entertainment"" (or worse-EDUtainment:P).  Disney would do well to learn, but they haven't-they're still not releasing the other Miyazaki films they bought the rights to.  Perhaps they realized that if people saw how bad their own animation hsa become that they'd have to spend the extra time to make GOOD movies instead of the mindless drivel or pathetic made-for-video sequels (Little Mermaid II anyone?) they keep pushing out to us.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Jeremy_Urquhart","22 August 2022","This was the second film in a double feature watched at my local cinema tonight, with the first being Akira. I think I may have preferred them in the other order? My general preference is to have the faster paced and/or shorter movie of the two in a double feature go second, but Princess Mononoke following Akira still worked alright.I do think this is Hayao Miyazaki's best movie, and I think at this point I've seen all the features he's directed, too. It's got those unique visuals and characters that only he could ever come up with, and it's surprising that such a rich and intricate world has only been explored in one movie (surprising in a good way. I think the fact there are no sequels or spin-offs or prequels make Princess Mononoke feel more special, and watching it today made me wonder whether the film would be left alone as its own thing, if made today).Miyazaki movies leave me a tiny bit cold when it comes to characters and story, but I feel that the least here. I don't think his films get to me as emotionally as they do other people, but Princess Mononoke is probably the one that comes closest for me at least. The story is well told and the environmental message really comes through, and even if the ending feels a bit rushed, it still hits hard and feels appropriate.It's also just a beautiful movie to look at and listen to, and much like Akira, the world is so awe-inspiring and an experience in itself to witness. Even if Princess Mononoke isn't one of my personal favourite animated films, I still really like it, and understand its status as a classic.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","dee.reid","12 August 2005","""Princess Mononoke"" is Japanese animation at its peak. It's full of dazzling visual delights, kinetic action, magic, mysticism, epic-level storytelling, and it is frankly quite difficult to not get swept up in it all. It made me laugh, it made me cringe, it scared me, and it moved me and it touched me, deeply. This is one of the most thematically deep and touching animated pictures I've ever seen. Lastly, it's also one of the most violent.Now I don't mean ""Princess Mononoke"" is violent in the same sense most Anime' is. This is not a 134-minute gorefest; it's ""PG-13,"" for crying out loud! But yes, people do get impaled, shot with arrows and bullets, forest animals transmute into swirling masses of life-sucking snakes and the blood does flow, but it is all done in a fashion that drives home the point of man's eternal conflict with nature.It helps to realize that Japanese animation is a lot more complex and daring than American animation cinema. The Japanese animators put forth enormous effort and strive for absolute perfection in their cinema, which places it on a level that will never be reached here in the United States.With that said, director Hayao Miyazaki, who is one of the most revered animators not just in Japan, but in the whole world, personally saw to it that ""Princess Mononoke"" made a successful transition from the drawing board, to the big screen, and finally to Japanese and American audiences. And in relaying ""Princess Mononoke's"" epic vision of man's conflict with nature to American audiences, comic book artist Neil Gaiman wrote the English script, and a fine cast of talented actors were brought in to voice the characters. Of course I'm talking about Billy Crudup, Gillian Anderson, Claire Danes, Minnie Driver, Jada Pinkett Smith, Keith David, and Billy Bob Thornton.Set in medieval Japan, the film opens (after a lengthy narration by David) at a small village that's fallen under attack from a mysterious creature that emerged from the dense forest outside its borders. The daring and heroic Ashitaka (Crudup) takes on the animal, a giant boar amassed by hideous snake-like creatures. It's defeated but in doing so, however, Ashitaka is wounded - his right arm badly scarred.The wise woman in his village reveals to him that he's fallen under a curse as a result of his battle with the boar. The boar, which was once a forest god, had been transformed into a demon as the result of being wounded by an iron bullet found in its skeletal remains; the bullet then drove the boar mad, sending it on a killing spree throughout the forest. And because he had fallen to the creature's curse, Ashitaka is forced to cut his top-knot and leave the village forever. His journey: to venture to a far off place in an attempt to find a cure for his curse.Accompanied by his loyal elk-like steed Yakkuru, he goes off. He stumbles onto Iron Town, a mostly female-run colony that serves as an iron processing station, and it's run by Lady Eboshi (Driver), who has a sort of trustful mother-like relationship with the women workers (many of whom are mostly former prostitutes) and an uneasy alliance with the male workers.Lady Eboshi is a strong and determined female, the likes of which is rarely seen in Japanese animation. She has surrounded herself with loyal workers that she treats with the utmost respect, and she commands enormous respect too. I really like Miyazaki's treatment of her character, and a great amount of admiration can also be laid upon one of her most trusted women - Toki (Smith).But Lady Eboshi is at war with the forest gods, in particular the wolf clan (which is headed by Moro - voiced by Anderson - and her adopted human daughter San - voiced by Danes) and the boar gods roaming outside the colony's gates. Her iron works is destroying the forest and the gods living there are angry. Lady Eboshi thinks it will all end if she is able to capture the head of the Forest Spirit, the spectral entity rumored to control all life in the woods where most of this conflict is taking place, and she aims to do it with the help of a lowly hunter named Jigo (Thornton), whom Ashitaka had encountered earlier on his journey to the colony.""Princess Mononoke"" is a wondrous achievement in animation. It's breathtaking, with an amazing story about the rise of technology, man's embracing of it, and the war it surely enough started with nature. ""Princess Mononoke"" carries the same weighted messages you might find at any ecological protest here in the U.S. but it's done in such an even-handed and fantastical fashion that you can't help but be taken in.The animation is flawless, as I read Miyazaki personally redrew over 20,000 cells. The voice actors do a tremendous job of translating Miyazaki's words and relaying it to us for consumption and comprehension. I first saw this film back during the summer of 2001 and I easily remember the feelings I had when I viewed it. It was one of the most stunningly realized animated pieces I'd ever seen, as it made me understand the true power of animation, in any form.It's one of my top favorite Anime' films, as Miyazaki would surpass it in 2002 with his superior epic ""Spirited Away,"" which rightfully earned the Oscar that year for Best Animated Feature. Hayao Miyazaki is currently one of the greatest animators, as he has made one of the most beloved Anime' films of all time. It's my thoughtful prediction that one day he'll make a superior animation piece that could be the one to top them all off...10/10","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Enchorde","11 March 2007","Recap: Suddenly a great monster leaps out of the forest attacking the village. Ashitaka, with a steady hand on his bow, slays the monster but is at the same time stricken by its curse. He must leave his village and travel far to find the Deer God, deep in his forests, and hope that the Deer God will save him. Once there, he finds that humans and animal gods are fighting. Humans are destroying the forests in the process of gathering iron and the animals are fighting back. In the lead is the wolf Moro, her two cubs and Mononoke, a girl raised by the wolves. Ashitaka finds himself in the middle, and also find himself attracted to Mononoke.Comments: Rather good actually. The tempo in the movie is not high, but not so slow either that you get bored, a problem I find with a lot of other animés. I also liked the story, as it really had a beginning, a comprehendible and motivated plot, and an end. But it still is an animé where the scenery takes much space and focus in the movie. Small creatures that have really no place in the story comes and goes. But they never gets overhand over the actual story and just enhances it with some cute mystery. There evidently also is an idea with the story, a message but I will not comment further on it. So I haven't very much more to say actually as the movie to me was quite average. Pretty good, but not spectacular.7/10","

And remembering that it's produced in 1997, it makes me honor and respect this movie even... even better. The characters are lovable and hateable, that's how characters in movie should be like. Some characters are just so ""human"" I want to slap them in the face, and by saying some, it already includes the good and bad characters. And the imperfection of the characters stance, that is another element that makes this movie works for me.The storyline is not a plain one character's problem which is typical and weak, it's a multi-sided one that makes you able to view everyone's ""importance"" in what they are doing and therefore understand the ""why"" in their actions.Without forgetting that, what I love most from this movie is the fact that it encourages people to love the environment and not being so greedy with our human's ambition, and it teaches us to understand that our prejudice about what we don't know sometimes is the thing that makes us do bad things, and it shows why people do some bad things and why war happens and... oh my, I can't arrange the right sentence of how great the movie is.Just watch it!!!","

Princess Mononoke is no exception to this kind of discovery. James Cameron got inspired by this movie, and then made AVATAR.The film is set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. Just kidding. It's set long ago in Japan when the land was ""nick-named"" the ""Land of the Gods"". The movie has an instant start. It's one of those good instant starts in a film; it doesn't rush itself.When I saw this movie on DVD for the first time last year, I was blown away by how unexpectedly good it was. Hayao Miyazaki has to be one of the film worlds top geniuses. I haven't seen My Neighbour Tottoro, but I plan to do that soon. This felt something like Spirited Away mixed in with Lord of the Rings, mixed in with a John Ford western.The main character Ashitaka encounters an evil god which he has to kill at the beginning of the movie, but the god wounds him giving him an infection that gives him mysterious superpowers. Later he encounters the titular Princess Mononoke, the girl raised by wolves. This movie shows A+ character development, drama and animation.That's all for the plot. The movie was awesome in all aspects, using the technique of a film genius. If you love anime, fantasy or out-of this-world movies, this is the perfect movie for you.10/10- A movie with little to no flaws at all. A masterpiece.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","WondrousMoose","18 July 2017","In a cinematic landscape inundated with sequels, reboots, and adaptations, it's refreshing to step back a decade or two and watch something wholly original and incredible. Princess Mononoke was Hayao Miyazaki's seventh feature film and remains the longest that he has directed. At 134 minutes long and with a story as grand as the world it depicts, Mononoke is far from the standard animated output of either the US or Japan. This one is violent. It is epic in the truest sense of the word. It shows us all the world in which we live, only completely different, and it does so brilliantly.We hear two distant drum blasts, and the film opens on vast, forest- covered mountains. Trees fall and plants die as a monster passes through the them. This, we learn, is an angry demon in the form of a giant boar, and it charges to attack a nearby settlement. Prince Ashitaka (Matsuda/Crudup) meets the monster outside of his village and defends his people from it, but not without sustaining a cursed injury. He must leave his village and head west to search for a cure.As he travels, he comes to Iron Town, which is under constant attack from the forest that it has been destroying. Leading this attack is San (Ishida/Danes), a human girl who was raised by a wolf deity and has vowed to kill the town's matriarch, Lady Eboshi (Tanaka/Driver). As the conflict escalates far beyond the town's mountain, Ashitaka must choose where his allegiances lies and how he can end the war.I consider this to be one of the few truly great, mainstream environmental films. Its treatment of the nuanced issues at hand is equally nuanced, and unlike the easy ""nature good/people bad"" moral of so many others, Mononoke is able to leave us with the message that there is a balance that must be maintained. Humanity will always develop and progress, but it must do so with the knowledge that our lives and our resources all depend on the world that we inhabit.This film pulls no punches. Limbs and heads are shot clean off, and hard questions don't get easy answers. Perhaps most challenging, though, is the character of Eboshi. She acts as the antagonist of the film but is benevolent toward those in her town, buying prostitutes out of nearby brothels and offering lepers employment and respect. She is destroying the environment surrounding her land but all for the sake of her people. The cultures and relationships depicted in Princess Mononoke are uncharacteristically real for a blockbuster release.Mononoke's animation is top-notch, even compared to Miyazaki's other works, as the landscapes, characters, and monsters are given incredible life and depth throughout. Joe Hisaishi's score is epic and has got to be among the greatest scores in an animated feature. The sound design as a whole is incredible; through it you can feel every arrow landing around you and smell the dust as it flies up from the feet of Ashitaka's elk. Princess Mononoke was supposed to be its director's last film, and while I am glad that he changed his mind, this would have made for a fine final work.","

They never say which side is good, it's up for the audience to decide, while never shoving the message down your throat like other environmental films at the time.

I am truly fond of Miyazakis creation and Princess Mononoke is by far his greatest film.The ""ground-breaking motion picture"", as it is described in the trailer, is about a young prince, Ashitaka, finding cure to a deadly curse put on him by a giant demon boar. On the road to salvation he meets Princess Mononoke (San the wolf-princess) and Lady Eboshi the mistress of the Iron town, who is on a campaign to destroy the forest gods for richness in the ground. As Ashitaka is torn between a brutal war between the forest and humans, he tries to make the right decisions and falls in love with San. The film is really about the conflict between nature and civilization. Somehow i feel that Mononoke has such a great story and that Mr Miyazaki has come up with something absolutely extraordinary.The animation itself is beyond doubt, exceptionally amazing. The little details of the forest and its creatures, the whole nature, is just astonishing. Disney and Pixar have a lot to learn and bow down to. The character development is pure and believable. There is no clear villain: everything has both evil and good inside, and that's what makes the story so good. You watch the movie and its magic just absorbs you into the films depth. The soundtrack too, is great and flows with haunting beauty.I truly believe that Princess Mononoke is the best animated movie of all time, it is just so good. The film touches you and makes you forget everything else. It brings a great message and is a masterpiece. The most beautiful picture i have ever seen.","

Spirited Away is also another excellent movie, as is Kiki and yes, I am a 40 year male. But I like nice stories and Kiki was that, a nice story.Everyone raves about this movie and maybe that was the problem, maybe my expectations where too high. I have seen a number of Studio Ghibli movies and had enjoyed most of them (except Tales of Earthsea). But I'm sorry, but this movie sits with that one, at the bottom. The story dragged on and on and really, none of the characters where really likeable. It was way more violent than I was expecting too with severed limbs and decapitations etc.It's probably the whole underlying environmental fluff that made me dislike it so much. The ""anti-human"" tone was annoying. I think I also got annoyed with the back and forth of, this person is bad, these wolves are bad, now everyone is good and now they are bad again. Pick a lane.Anyway, I'm obviously in the minority in my view of this movie. Like I said, love a lot of Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki movies. This one, certainly isn't one of them. Do yourself a favour and watch Laputa, Castle in the sky or Spirited Away. Much much much better movies.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","sadrec1","11 October 2004","Another film by Hayao Myzaki, Princess Mononoke is a prime example of what a skilled animator can do at the prime of his career.Plot: Like the best of his work, with the execption of Castle of Calligostro, is based heavily upon Japanese Shintoism and Mysticism. Myazaki was enchanted as a child by the traditions of his island country, and it has been an endless source of inspiration. Although a monotheist and a Christian, I enjoyed the film because the god characters, much like the gods of Homer and Aesop, act upon such human feelings as blind hatred and jealousy. Though probably unintentional, Hayao shows what happens when imperfect beings try to create perfection: a god in their image, male and female. The rest of the plot is a standard Man-with-no-name wanderer-type story, whos travels to a mining town to find a feud he's caught in. More time could have been spent on the histories of Moro, San, and Nago, but in the end, Hayao creates an enjoyable time.Animation: For one of the first times, Miyazaki uses digital animation in his films, and very tastefully so. The forest is given his trademark another world look, which I cannot describe beyond it reminds of the Como Conservatory (minnesotans will know.) The Kodamas are adorable, and the animation of the Ape clan at night sent chills up my spine.Voice characterization: Like most translated anime, not perfect. Don't get me wrong, Billy Crudup is talented. Any Big Fish fan will tell you that. He just has trouble with pacing the translated script. He reads very quietly and quickly, lacking clarity sometimes. Claire Danes is slightly better, but still suffers. Minnie Driver, familiar with animation through Tarzan, is very good. The real gems, however, are Billy Bob Thornton and Gillian Anderson. Thornton, a musician, reads his script with amazing clarity and pacing. Jigo's, his character, mouth matches almost all of the time. Anderson, on the other hand, has one of the most beautiful voices of a animation vocal talent I've ever heard. Her haunting, slow reading of the words of the tortured wolf goddess Moro is perfect.Overall: Miyazaki has made family adventures with Castle in the Sky, growing-up films with Kiki's Delivery Service and My Neighbor Totoro, and even slick, 70s crime romps with The Castle of Calligostro. He successfully adds a Yojimbo feudal Japanese epic to his belt with Princess Mononoke.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","moribana","12 April 2001","Miyazaki-san has taken the soul of the Japanese landscape and its attendant Shinto mythos and spun a mighty tale.  It still has the wonder of his other features, but this one is different, mixed with a kind of Shakespearean grandeur and tragic intensity.  It's almost ruthless in its lack of sentiment, but because of this it achieves, at least to this viewer, a visionary breakthrough into unfamiliar territory.  This one will stay through the years and if you attend well enough, haunt your dreams.Kudos to Miramax for taking it so seriously and doing a good job with the dubbing.  Still, the American English just does not really match.  It is too laid back, softened and rounded.  It really dulls the impact of this film. The Japanese in Mononoke hime is quick and powerful, full of meaningful silences that the painting harmonizes with.  In English this basic rhythm of the film is all out of kilt.Anyway, you can tell I liked it!","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","anicerman","14 November 2006","This film may not be as fun as Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi and Howl's Moving Castle, but it's still my favourite because of the great plot.The film started with the Prince who gets a curse from ""boar king"". He then leaves the village to find a cure for his curse. Coincidentally he arrives at a iron-mining town and later meets Princess Mononoke on animals' side in the war between animals and humans. At last, in revenge for the death of the boar king, the boar god starts the war.You'll see there's much Japanese mythical imagination throughout the film, but it may not be the kind of film for family as you won't find much or even any laughter in the film but the illustration of the devil, blood and wounds. Anyway, Miyazaki tries to remind us of the importance of environment protection. Humans' greed may get the life-taking deer god's revenge in return.The whole film runs very smoothly yet slowly, but what I like best is the whole theme and also the way it's presented. You'll just enjoy the film itself as a kind of imaginative story, or give it some more thoughts because it's not usual to find many in the industry comparable to the works Miyazaki produces.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","blackmamba99971","12 April 2010","This is a great example of how the earth is so important. What we see is a land in Japan going industrial in the Shogun era. People under the tutelage of a woman who runs iron town. Basically a business woman who oversees her workers mining and smelting the iron to make fire arms or other forms of artillery. In the middle are two would be hero's, one is called San and the other Ashitaku, a lone man who was exiled from his village for being poisoned by a god turned demon. In his investigations he learns that the iron town was responsible for cutting down the trees and mining ore. But never gave back to the forest which made the gods angry. Seeing as the gods were going to battle, one lone schemer among the chaos only wanted the head of the forest spirit, to give his life a reprieve from the emperors sentence. Through it all San and Ashitaku try to achieve a goal of coexistence between the forest gods and humans, but all for not. Both sides went to war and the humans were winning their place in history. To see such grand scale imagery as well as a well thought out story I have to admit, this was a great teaching tool of ecological disasters. It was sad to see the forest spirit die to let the humans take their place alone in the world. To never again rely on the gods which had protected them for thousands of years or for that matter before time. But gods know that humans can endure the most riddled hardships handed to them, and must step aside to allow the human race to make mistakes themselves and to recover. I liked the way how the animals began to forget their own comprehension's and began to DE-evolve to ordinary animals of the wild. Brilliant picture, and brilliant cast.","

I saw it just a few days after entering college, and i can clearly say i don't regret it. This is definitely the greatest achievement in all animation's history. And there is nothing more to be said about it. Some will precisely say it's annoying to watch a movie (almost) everyone loves, but nevermind. More than ever the message of it all is so strong, so deep no one could forget it: The spirit of Nature lies way above our comprehension, but we despise and keep on killing it slowly. Period.

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Demetrius_Stork","20 December 2015","Wow. This movie blew me away, to say the very least. All of it was captivating; the animation, the characters, and story, all of it done to perfection. Hayao Miyazaki, whose work I'm only beginning to take notice of, is truly a genius in terms of bringing landscapes and it's many creatures to life.The plot revolves around Prince Ashitaka, who is told that he must leave his village and never return after he is cursed by a horrible demon. Ashitaka, along with his red elk, Yakul, sets out on a journey to ""see with eyes unclouded by hate,"" as he puts it and his journey brings him to see many things. He comes across a prosperous settlement that produces iron, fittingly named iron town, and its leader Lady Eboshi, voiced by Minnie Driver. Ashitaka finds that Iron town is at war with the creatures of the forest due to the human's attempting to settle in the forest to create prosperity, which of course the forest dwellers aren't happy about. Ashitaka later meets the princess of the wolf tribe San, who happens to be a human despite her title. Ashitaka becomes caught in the middle of a dispute as old as time itself, man versus animal.Several other characters are added to the mix; a strange little man named Jigo, voiced by Billy Bob Thornton, the lieutenant to Lady Eboshi Gonza, voiced by John DiMaggio (the voice of Bender), Moro, the god of the wolves, and Okkoto the god of the boars. These characters are all brilliantly written, and all have their own likability. One thing that this movie does well is that there isn't really any main villain. All of them have reasonable motivations behind what they're doing. It would have been so easy for this movie to throw in a tired message about how man is evil and how we should save the environment. Many may argue that this movie is trying to set up this message, but I don't think so. Lady Eboshi isn't necessarily a bad person. She's a strong person, who doesn't back down in times of adversity. She's a good leader who protects her people and only wants the best for them, giving a home to the lepers, fighting for the lives of her people against the boars, and sticking up for her fellow women's rights and honor. While on the other side the wolves aren't the villains either; only wanting to protect the spirits of the forest and their home from what they perceive to be their worst enemy, the humans. It's understandable why both sides feel this way, they all have a reasonable motivation and likability.The animation in this film is breathtaking, the creatures just fly off the screen with how they're drawn and how they move. The creatures in this world are all just so creative and beautiful in their designs. The Spirit of the Forest is one of my favorite designs in animation history, especially when the sun goes down. Even the designs of creatures that already exist, like the apes or the boars, all have a unique design and charm. This movie could honestly be watched on mute and still be thoroughly enjoyed.The story of this movie is unbelievably fantastic and deserves much more recognition than it gets in the U.S. It's a fantastic movie by a fantastic animator and is now, after seeing this for the first time yesterday, one of my all time favorites.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","KFstudios2009","4 September 2023","Mononoke-hime is kind of movie that I usually don't comment. But since this is a review, I have to tell you about my thoughts and general opinion. From Studio Ghibli, this is a very bad movie. From the beginning, I didn't like it, in the middle, I didn't like it, and the ending was just something that was a big disaster, really disappointing movie. It tells us that we have to protect the forest and that when you fight with a team, it is better than fighting alone. I think the message that they tried to show us, was good. The music soundtrack and a few of the action sequences were good. But about the bad sides, well, badly introduced characters, I couldn't enjoy them and learn more about them, they just went right in. The animation was poor, and believe me, I think anime animation is good, but in here, it felt incomplete and fast drawn without any potential. That annoyed me a lot, watching this poor animation. Generally, the action and the whole movie were too long, I really got bored the last 30 minutes or so. The animals, the voice-actors to the animals, were amazingly bad. Didn't fit the character's type and attitude. A movie that didn't entertain me very much. Very boring, weak animation, but some good action scenes and music sound were good. The moral about keeping and protecting the forest was good, But haven't we seen that before? Very weak movie, expected more potential, but got a big disappointed instead.","

So, Japanime isn't always popular with me, but I really like this movie. I relate to the main character because he cares about others and does what he can to help. And the movie showcases cooperation between animals and humans well... think horses. Yakul, Ashitaka's red elk, which looks like a Tauntaun from Star Wars, carries him from place to place. At the beginning of the film, actually, he is riding Yakul when Nago, a wild boar covered with a horrible spirit, attacks a small village. Ashitaka helps a small group of villagers escape from Nago, who looks like he is covered in a heavy, thick, amorphous black oil, but upon closer inspection, it looks more like a pool of worms. These worms shoot out of him like tentacles. A piece of the black spirit shoots out from Nago and strongly twirls, lightly grabbing Ashitaka's right arm. He pulls away. While a small amount of the sludge is on his arm, he is able to release an arrow into the monster's eye, killing him. After his first fight, as his arm rots, this wound glows and he needs help to heal it or else he will die. Find out how iron is killing the animals and see how Ashitaka helps save the forest while preventing his own death.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Nifune","1 November 2018","""Nature vs. Human"" is one of the central topics of this film. What many people misunderstand is that, however, this ""human"" (symbolized by ""Jigo"") includes most of the ordinary people in the world who live in a wood-made house, drive a car exhausting gas, and use plastic-made goods, not only the hopeless money-driven people who typically make a golf-course by cutting woods.From the bird's viewpoint, modern capitalism or neoliberalism is coherently and thoroughly criticized, for San (Princess Mononoke) symbolizing ""nature"" is consistently not compatible with ""human"" until the end. Ashitaka intends to reconcile ""nature"" and ""human"", but unfortunately, his way is to accept the conflict and discrepancy of them with his endless struggle. So the dog-god Moro strictly advised him to ""live"" beforehand.In the mid '90s, a continuous economic decline, ""lost 25 years"", were just beginning in Japan when people committing suicide were increasing in the locked-up feeling. On the other hand, people who lived in the Muromachi era around 500 years ago always deliberated their views of life and death facing daily deaths. The strong and catchy message of this film, ""survive"", thus having a double meaning, must be widely accepted 20 years ago.After 20 years still in the economic decline and left behind the global economy, Japan rather seems to recover its harmony with nature and human or anti-capitalism compared to that time. So far partly and still fashionable though, no golf and no cars, increase in young people loving more rural areas than urban ones, development of ecosystem such as electric cars, the advent of minimalism and sharing economy... probably these new trends would be life sprouts after their economic death as if caused by Shishi-gami!","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Jeremiah-8","29 November 1999","Hiyao Miyazaki brings his poetic sensibility to `Princess Mononoke,' the latest from Studio Ghibi. The film is an ecological fable about the conflict between man and nature, but offers no solutions or preachy messages like most animated films. In addition, it doesn't provide the usual scapegoats or easy targets we are used to. The genius of the film lies not only in its pure cinematic excellence (each image is stunning in its beauty and detail), but its willingness to provide clear and understandable motivation for the consumers/exploiters.Lady Eboshi (voiced elegantly by Minnie Driver) runs Iron Town, a mining village which is reaping its raw material from the Great Forest, taking it by force against the will of the Animal Gods, who battle to regain control over their habitat. Traditionally, Lady Eboshi would be an unrepentant villain who needs to be taught a lesson: destroy the environment and we destroy ourselves. Easy to say, right? Try telling that to the women who work the factory, who were once prostitutes before the lady took them in to work, or the lepers, whom no one but she would hire. Suddenly, the issue becomes clouded. And we understand that technology is both a friend and an enemy. Where would we be without industrial progress? (Miyazaki himself has understood in other films the wonder and glory of these advances, having a fascination for flying mechanisms which runs through his entire body of work.)However, industrial progress comes with a price, and the film unflinchingly portrays Lady Eboshi's cavalier destruction of the forests and disregard for the lives of the Animal Gods who live there. The Boar Tribe is almost entirely wiped out. The Ape Tribe is afraid to plant new trees for fear of the fiery man made catapults. The Wolf Goddess is dying from a poisoned bullet, grimly accepting her fate.San (Princess Mononoke, voiced by Clare Danes) is one of the key defenders of the forest, raised by the Wolf Goddess to despise all humans. The iron bullets are transforming the Gods into vicious Demons, wrecking everything in their path, and the damage is going beyond the Forest and Iron Town, into remote villages throughout Japan.  The film's protagonist, Ashitaka (voiced by Billy Crudup) comes from such a village, attacked by a mad Demon Boar and leaving him with a poisoned wound which will slowly infect his entire body and corrupt him. Ashitaka rides into town and attempts to bring both sides together in a compromise.As you can see, the mythos heavy plot requires you to keep up, but the film is consistently entertaining.  It features epic battle scenes which rival those of the master, Akira Kurosawa (an admirer of Miyazaki's work), and an understanding of how animals behave which is believable throughout (in body language, gesture and, seemingly, in thoughts.)  The adaptation by Neil Gaiman is remarkably vivid, unlike most translations, which seem to lose something special from the source. The voice characterizations range from excellent (Driver, Crudup, Gillian Anderson as the quietly ferocious Wolf God) to questionable (Clare Daines is a bit too cutesy as San, and Billy Bob Thornton is at first seemingly a strange choice as Jiro, a sneaky monk, but neither of them are too distracting. Billy Bob actually grew on me.)`Princess Mononoke' was one of the finest films I've seen this year.","

The animation work is great and rich in details, again as always from Studio Ghibli. But especially I liked how this movie contains some of the most beautiful still set drawings of backgrounds. As stills, they look so realistically beautiful, which also a bad side that it makes the foregrounds and moving animations seems too distinctive and don't blend well.

But it's not a favorite of mine. The movie's certainly ambitious, once again tackling an ecological story and adding a sense of ambiguity; good-and-evil isn't so simple, and the real struggle is for a balance between industry and nature. My problem (and I speak solely for myself) is that I couldn't get ""Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind"" out of my head for most of this runtime. And I think that that film is entirely more potent with a well-defined heroine. Here, there's a split between Ashitaka, Lady Eboshi and Princess Mononoke, and even though the tone is definitely more adult (with the violence to match), the prior movie had the more effective characters. Is that fair? Maybe not, but again, it's just me. But like I said before, this is impressive on a technical level. 6/10","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Sankari_Suomi","15 July 2017","This haunting tale of two young hearts trapped in a world gone mad will linger long after you've turned off the TV.The art style is classic Ghibli: fluid movement, realistic proportions, a strong moral component and the traditional clash between noble protagonists and immoral antagonists.That said, it's also pretty dark. Mononoke Hime revels in scenes of wanton violence, involving severed limbs, decapitated heads, copious amounts of blood, and that old Japanese favourite, the orifice-probing tentacle. Perhaps the boldest aspect of the story is its lack of a clear victory for the hero. Resolution is achieved, but it comes at a terrible cost. The most powerful character—a nature god—is presented as benevolent, yet seems almost indifferent to the plight of the forest creatures that worship him. His goals are clear, but his methods are harsh. He shows no interest in evening the score between oppressor and oppressed; he simply seeks to restore the balance, without any regard for the price that others will pay. There is no sense of fairness here. The deer god is an wild spirit; an animist's god from the ancient times. He does not issue judgement; he simply does what needs to be done. 'Justice' is a luxury for the gods of theists.I rate Mononoke Hime at 29.97, which works out as an orifice-probing 9/10 on IMDb.","

This movie is the kind of thing that Disney used to put out back in its glory days. Unique tale of man vs. nature stepped heavily in Japanese mythology. The characters are well realized and Miyazaki refuses to make them purely good or evil. They all posess shades of grey that you don't often see in characters in most modern animated fables. The English version of this movie is very well done. The translation is quite accurate and Neil Gaiman was the perfect choice for writing the English screenplay for a movie like this. The dubbing, which could've easilly killed this film, is good for the most part. The best performances come from Gillian Anderson (whose husky voice suits Moro perfectly) and Minnie Driver, who does such a fine job you don't even think about someone speaking with an English accent in feudal Japan.I'm glad to see this movie not only getting released in America, but actually being shown in theaters al well. This is a movie that should be seen on the big screen, as it best delivers the full visual effect. I really hope that Miyazaki makes another movie.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","toqtaqiya2","19 October 2010","Director Hayao Miyazaki spent twenty years considering the story that would eventually become Princess Mononoke, transforming it from something more obviously linked to fairytale and folklore into a passionate plea for us to learn from history instead of simply repeating it. It's an uncomfortable film, full of ambiguity. Ashitaka is the perfect hero, brave, strong, unpretentious, and kind, yet he kills when he has to. San - vicious, unreasoning, and utterly focused - ought to be a villain, but Miyazaki refuses to allow that simplistic label, insisting through each of his characters and their relationships that instead of name-calling we should be cooperating, because the only alternative is destruction. Princess Mononoke is a primitive film in many ways, both violent and pessimistic. The woodlands in which it is set are full of strange spirits and gods, beautiful, but threatening. The score by Joe Hisaishi supports this sense of threat, with a closing theme that's an eerie counter tenor solo that sends chills down the spine. It's also the first Studio Ghibli film to make extensive use of computer animation, a decision taken by producer Toshio Suzuki to meet an otherwise impossible deadline at the end of the three-year production process. Unlike other Miyazaki films this one is not for small children - there's too much violence, bloodshed and death for that. It's a complex, legendary tale, but one that is easy to follow, thrillingly exciting, and never less than beautiful to look at - like a detailed painting brought to life. Though it was Miyazaki's subsequent effort, Spirited Away (2001), that won the Oscar, Princess Mononoke is probably more worthy of it.","

We all know ""the message"" because we've seen it before so nothing new here except the Japanese mythology. I really loved the visuals, they were stunning...but after our hero leaves with princess Mononoke everything begins to crumble. A lot of time and potential was lost in the first minutes being dragged and then everything seems to end so abruptly trying to tie lose ends and introduce new characters at the speed of light.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","DonaldDooD","27 July 2014","Princess Mononoke is one of Studio Ghibli's most acclaimed films, only behind Spirited Away. And few films deserve so much praise. Princess Mononoke is beautiful, emotional, and surprisingly violent. When I first watched it at 13/14, it was like nothing I'd ever seen, and it holds up.Miyazaki's films, especially Castle in the Sky and Nausicaa, focus on man's relationship with nature. But in these films, its clear that the environmentally-unfriendly military men are the bad guys. There is little characterization to them. Princess Mononoke is the ultimate evolution of these ideas, where neither side is portrayed as good or evil. Lady Eboshi, the leader of the mining town, is callous towards nature, but kind to her people, taking in those society has thrown away. The gods and beasts of the forest exhibit similar love and hate. This balance makes the world more realistic, and the danger more terrifying. And while some sort of peace is made between the sides, Miyazaki doesn't force a perfect answer.But its more than environmental commentary. The animation is among the best. Combined with majestic backgrounds of nature and a dramatic orchestra score, only other Ghibli films come close to matching Princess Mononoke's beauty. The action is thrilling, with perfect dramatic tension and intimidating creatures to face against the humans. Its one of the hardest PG-13 films I've seen, so don't show it to underage kids.Princess Mononoke is an anime classic. Everyone whose a fan of animation has seen this film. I'm just another voice gushing over it. If you're not a fan of anime, I promise you it doesn't fall for its immature tropes. If a 9-star film had to be a 10, I'd choose this one.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","tomfry-10237","8 May 2019","Hayao Miyazaki isn't a name synonymous with fantasy epics grand and aggressive such as the Lord of The Rings, yet in a pleasant twist of fate it appears as if the renowned director has yet another genre wrapped around his finger, intertwining a vast yet personal epic with a profound message for the younger viewer in 1997's 'Princess Mononoke'.Suffering a cursed injury, Ashitaka, the last Emishi prince of the Emishi village, finds himself on a journey Westward bound to try and find a cure for his ever-worsening ailment. Along the way we meet a colourful cast of characters including the titular Princess Mononoke (San) and her band of wolves.Venturing into the wild Ashitaka discovers a town destroying the land around them, the home of the wolves, in order to develop iron, growing exponentially in power and wealth. Should this trope sound familiar to you it would be for good reason. For many years the issue of defamation of the natural world for the prosperity of humanity has been a frequently touched upon issue, yet from the get-go the beauty in this film is in its initial reluctance, and then outright refusal to take a side.The destructive mentality of the people of the ironworks is merely a community attempting to find its place in the world; they destroy to prevent themselves from being destroyed (as it is established clearly they are not the most powerful force in this world). They destroy in fear of being destroyed, in many ways a reflection of the aggressive animals they kill rather than a binary opposition. Following this train of thought, even the animals are not without fault. The forest is divided into tribes of different species, and amongst them it is clear that there is conflict. They bicker and fight all in a desperate bid to survive, much the reflection of ourselves.This conflict is centralised through our connection to Ashitaka whom from the first scenes retains a clear reverence for nature, smiling and gazing in wonder at its otherworldly beauty. He acts as us, the everyman, looking on in horror as two worlds that he adores and is familiar with crash together In fire and blood, a desperate bid for survival where no survival is guaranteed. He fits his role very well and plays off San well also, however if I did have one flaw with the film it would be that: in earlier scenes he seems to develop a connection with San that is only apparent to them and doesn't translate to the audience very well (yet one could always argue that the reason for this is as what they represent thematically usurps what they represent in emotional connection.)Speaking of fire and blood, this is by far one of the most unexpectedly violent Studio Ghibli films I have ever laid eyes on. From the first scene blood is abundant, limbs are lost and death reins over the land. However, unexpected as it threw me, out of place it was not. The violence perfectly reflects the theme previously mentioned; the disarray of the conflict at the centre of the film between the growth of industry and nature, senseless and heart-breaking.This profound melancholy surrounding the theme yet contrasts itself with joyous human moments sprinkled throughout the film in romance, friendship etc. all heightened by a mesmerising score and Ghibli's signature rich vibrant visuals, which both make the world we're exploring feel full, truly living and breathing.Princess Mononoke is a film which takes risks, hovering in-between the side of nature's right to rule and the roaring progress of industrialisation, yet never wavering in its resolve. It knows that the issue isn't black and white, with dynamic elements frequently affecting the actions of both man and beast, with violence resulting from confusion, and a sense of pensive grief hanging over the film. Through all this conflict, neither side overcomes in the end, with the beauty of life itself being the true victory, a truly profound message for both children and adults alike.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","veed_santos","17 April 2010","One of those movies you don't see every day, month or year. The story is simple, modest and at the same time, groundbreaking and epic for its mix of reality and fantasy (actually the premise is very similar to Nausicaa's). The characters are also very simple. However you can't help but sympathize with them, even with the antagonists, each one of them is unique, well developed and with its own fundamented and reasonable goal. The visuals are simply stunning, I will go and say: the best the 90's anime have seen. This movie will entertain you and make you think, there's a lot more to it than gods, demons, ecological messages, smooth and violent action sequences or beautiful emotional scenes. Watch how every character's action in this story can affect everyone and everything around them.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","chuck-526","20 October 2009","Watching this classic hit Princess Mononoke now (2009) means DVD. The Region 1 DVD has lots of choices for sound, so you can either watch the ""American"" version or the ""Japanese"" version (or watch both or even switch), perhaps depending on whether or not you're an anime geek. The DVD has both the original sound track and the ""dubbed"" English sound track (and a dubbed French sound track too). It has two separate sets of subtitles, one also called ""captions"" that matches the dubbed English translation, and the other also called ""subtitles"" that are apparently the original transliteration from Japanese to English. (Be careful though that although both original and dubbed soundtracks are on this particular DVD, this is not necessarily true of other DVDs. For example I've heard, although I haven't yet seen for myself, that the only way to get both original and dubbed soundtracks on the same media for Ponyo is to get the Blu-Ray version.) The dubbing is very high quality. Although there are lots of opinions about exactly how it should have been done (or even whether it should have been done at all), it's clear it wasn't done ""in a hurry"" or ""on the cheap"". Although various people take issue for different reasons with different voices used for dubbing, the appropriateness and quality of the voices seem good to me.The original English subtitles are severely abbreviated, almost schematic. Comparing them to other translations available on the web (I don't speak Japanese) shows they're invariably much shorter. They minimally sketch in the story line while letting the viewer focus on the visual.One even suspects the original English subtitles weren't given careful attention, as frequently they are a bit awkward or stilted, and it seems they don't even try to carry nuances. For example, the Emishi village is led by an old woman; she helps think for the village, and when necessary she predicts the future too. The dubbed translation calls her the ""wise woman"", whereas the original subtitles call her the ""oracle"". Surely a better word naming a leader than ""oracle"" was available.A definite plus of the original subtitles is they're very good at conveying the (assumed intentional) ambiguities in the audio. Sometimes words can be understood two different ways, and every once in a while it's not clear which of two characters in a scene spoke some of the words. For example ""forget it"" can mean either ""you aren't understanding me"" or ""don't remember what you think you just saw"" (or both). The original subtitles are very good at conveying this sort of thing.You can switch between the various subtitles with the usual DVD button. But for some reason you can't use the usual Audio/Language DVD button to switch between dubbing and original; you have to go to the Menu, change the Spoken Languages setting, then select the Return to Film option from the menu.The music is almost exactly the same (except for translated lyrics) in both original and dubbed sound tracks. My guess (I don't really know) as to how they did this is the creators of the dubbed sound track had the complete original score, and had the whole thing performed again. The sound effects are largely the same too, although in the dubbing the intensity and timing of the sound effects are frequently modified.The English dubbed soundtrack is not just a literal translation, but is slightly different in quite a few ways. (The very simplified mouth movements of anime characters make it easy to change words, or languages, or even to make a silent character speak.) Types of differences in the dubbed soundtrack I noticed include: perhaps most importantly, the plot and symbolism of the story is made plainer; some of the dialog is a little more colorful; simple cultural differences are bridged painlessly (by contrast, more complex cultural differences are wisely ignored); ambiguous language is made clearer; a sexual innuendo (the only one I noticed) is softened so much that it disappears; and sometimes elements of the story thought distracting are simplified.And a very few times it appears the translators just plain blew it (or tried to change something I don't think they should have). When in the Emishi village the girl Kaya calls the departing Ashitaka ""older brother"" and gives him her jeweled dagger, the dubbing just translates the words literally, which means treating the girl as nothing more than a little sister. As a result, much later when San is given the jeweled dagger, she can't say anything more than ""pretty"". The original term though is one of those words that has both an archaic and a modern meaning. The archaic meaning is something closer to ""respected elder"", making it clear the girl is not his blood sister but rather his village sweetheart. And her jeweled dagger is a symbol of ""eternal love"", like a gold locket to Americans. Thus Ashitaka later giving the jeweled dagger to San plainly states his choice of his one true love. Unfortunately the dubbed sound track misses all this.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","x_manicure_x","14 August 2021","Got a chance to rewatch ""Princess Mononoke"" after years thanks to the Japanese movie theaters initiative to bring back Studio Ghibli classics to the big screen. I was surprised to find it way more mature, grim, and violent than I remembered.The film deals with the relationship between man and nature as a problem that cannot be ultimately solved. Mankind's instinct is to progress, destroy and conquer, but is ultimately doomed to extinction like any other species, no matter how advanced their weapons become. Nature, represented by the gods of the forest, can be dominated and manipulated by mankind, but still remains the only irrational force that can give and take arbitrarily. Ashitaka's position is neutral, he is just doing his best to keep living aware of his condition as a human being and avoid conflict. None of the characters is truly good or bad, but conflict is inevitable as part of our nature (corruption even drives Ashitaka to unwillingly kill people).The art direction is flawless as always, this time focused on the equivalent of Japan's medieval age and its animistic beliefs. Every Studio Ghibli film has its own unique atmosphere, but the mystic, grim mood of ""Princess Mononoke"" is still unsurpassed. Joe Hisaishi's soundtrack also heightens the epic quality and intensity of the film, with some of his most famous compositions. Gives me goosebumps every time.My only complaint is that, like in most of Studio Ghibli's films, the ending felt a bit rushed despite the long, slow-paced buildup.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","buzzerbill","6 January 2006","Last night I watched this film. Just before the credits rolled, one of my cats got up, gave a disdainful sniff, walked into the bathroom and into his box, and delivered his own large and malodorous comment.I have to go with my cat on this one. My immediate reaction to this film when it ended was, very simply, ""Great looking, but the dumbest story I have seen in a long, long time."" I have to admit to a few criteria here. I am not an animation fan. For me, animation pretty much begins and ends with Warner Brothers and Chuck Jones, who taught us all that pretty pictures and trembling leaves and water droplets always get trumped by a great script. Jones's best work, combining a linear and somewhat abstract style with high and low comedy, is the best. Disney--let's face it--is gooey. And many other recent animation hits have been 15 minute shorts exploded into features, like ""The Triplets of Bellville,"" which would have been far better if it had stopped after the first 15 minutes. (Okay, okay, I did like ""Toy Story"". And ""Fantasia."") ""Princess Mononoke"" gets points for two things. First, it looks good and often looks wonderful. Second, it does sustain itself for close to two hours. And credit is due for trying to be serious, while still catering to the core kid demographic. However, Miyazaki's script is, to put it charitably, a mess. Its civilization vs. nature theme is very, very tired, and most of the time it just does not make any sense. A single example: Forest Spirit's head is removed. FS turns into a Japanese version of the blob and destroying the forest. FS gets head back--dies and crushes Irontown--and the forest grows again. Someone please convince me that this can make any sense whatsoever. If you are going to the trouble of creating a film for adults with capital-S Significance, you ought at least to make your case persuasively. You can call it ecological consciousness; you can call it Shinto animism; I call it pretentious, ill-digested crap.This has been touted as one of the great films of our time. Sorry, this reviewer will generally agree with his cat's tribute. Seek it out if you are an animation junkie and enthralled with the techniques. I certainly cannot recommend it as a film.","

It showed great views of human and animals. I really loved the ending of how everything that was destroyed recovered.The reason why this movie is one of my best movie is because it has great deep meaning behind just a kid movie.

You know,having seen ""Howl's moving castle"",""my neighbour totoro"" and ""spirited away"" beforehand made it seem intense. but you know that's the only way they would've been able to illustrate how senseless human atrocities are. The first time I saw it,I didn't make much of it,but it kept playing in the background of my mind. And that's where the genius of it lies,in my opinion. I mean,any movie that keeps you thinking afterwards is a successful movie. My takeaway from it was,other than the obvious ""humans,stop messing with mother nature"",it was most importantly the terribleness -if I may - of hatred and anger. What I learned from it is that when people feel hurt,they can become toxic if they choose not to forgive and hold on to their grudges. Like, that boar literally turned to a demon and was infecting whoever came close to him because he let hate get the best of him. Also,it made me realize that,indeed,like the movie pointed out,hate does feed on anger and fear. Also,it highlights the idea that each story has two sides,and we should really drop our prejudices in order to make room for understanding. All in all,this movie is a piece of art that you don't have to understand or appreciate from the first time,but that gets many messages through.","

He finds himself in the middle of a war between a human tribe, who wants to advance in science and build a caste to defend themselves against ""wild"" animals and the samurai, and those animals of the nearby forest. But Ashitaka doesn't want to choose one side. He wishes for peace between the human beings and the animals.This movie is great because of its story about pacifism and environmental protection. Furthermore the characters are amazing, especially the MC Ashitaka. That's why i prefer this film over Sprited away and Grave of the fireflies.","

Here the master craftsman has created his greatest piece (amazingly equaled by his next, Spirited Away). And it is beautiful.The story reaches the viewer on many levels... forcing one to see each of the many points of view conflicting the story. The Forest Gods are dying off as the Iron Age takes over, as it must. Do they go to war because they have no hope, or because they must? The Iron Town must destroy the Forest Gods and use the environment if the people are to prosper in the evolving civilization. Do they kill because they are defending their way of life, just as the Forest Gods are? The Emperor wants eternal life, something that only the head of the Great Forest Spirit can give. Aren't the bounty hunters looking to kill the Great Forest Spirit just doing their jobs? In the end, war only brings death, and nobody is satisfied with what it brings.

He runs into a war between the forest and humans as the humans look to destroy the forest and kill the magic that resides inside it.This movie is directed by legend Hayao Miyazaki (Howl's Moving Castle) and contains the voices of Billy Crudup (Big Fish), Billy Bob Thornton (Slingblade), Minnie Driver (Goodwill Hunting), Keith David (Requiem for a Dream), Gillian Anderson (The X-Files) and Jada Pinkett Smith (The Matrix).The animation for this is out of this world and brilliantly creates a fierce and magical world. The action scenes are outstanding and contains a great deal of realism with kills, injuries and drama. The characters are outstanding and well delivered and evolve throughout the film well. There is a tremendous message throughout the film and the ending is brilliantly mature.Overall this is an all time great, very smart and well done animated gem.

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","siderite","12 November 2023","This is one of the most celebrated Miyazaki anime productions ever and for good reason. In a way it's a simple story, a feudal magical plot where traditional Japanese folklore and spirituality clashes with the realities of being human. However the attention to detail, the way each important character is portrayed as main, with little to no judgement, letting the viewer decide who is what and which decision or path in life is better, that is what makes this film great.The plot goes like this: a prince from the East defends his village against a monstrous demon, thus getting cursed with something that rots him from inside out and eventually will kill him. The young man must journey to the West to determine the cause of the curse, the source of the mysterious iron ball that killed a god and perhaps find a cure for his curse. But upon reaching his destination, he gets embroiled into tribal conflict between multiple factions, human and spirits. Maintaining neutrality will take strength, or maybe weakness. The movie is such that you are free to choose any option. There are no villains and no heroes, just characters set on their path by their own beliefs and narratives.If there is something that I did not like is the name. The main character is not Princess Mononoke. In fact there is no indication of why she is a princess and for what and most of the time she is just a love interest and a secondary character. The lead role falls upon prince Ashitaka. Why was this not called Prince Ashitaka, then? Don't know. Also there is something to be said of people always killing minor characters and letting the major ones live or do whatever. A trope that I personally don't like.Bottom line: I was blown away by this when I watched it 20 years ago. Watching it again I wasn't as awed by the film, but I enjoyed it tremendously and saw it in a new light as well. Highly recommended.","

The other positives are maybe that it's cannot be fully understanded - that's what I love in Miyazaki. He never explains everything, never tells us what to think, but after one of his films, we always feel that we've learnt something very important.

Unless he finds a way to lift the curse, he will die. In order to do this, he must journey to the far west where the demon comes from.And so Ashitaka's adventure begins. His journey takes him into the forest of the Deer God, filled with magical creatures. The Deer God is a mystical creature that looks like a deer by day, but transforms into a giant Nightwalker by night. In the forest, Ashitaka encounters San - dubbed Princess Mononoke - a young girl who's soul was stolen by the wolves. Now, she is nor human, nor wolf, and hates humankind.Nearby is Iron Town, where they mine for iron. Cutting away a great deal of the forest, they caused conflict with the boars living in the woods. The mining is lead by Eboshi, who was responsible for a giant boar, Nago, to turn into the demon god that attacked Ashitaka's village.As Ashitaka's injuries worsens, he is running out of time before he, too, turns into a demon. The film therefore becomes an exciting race against time.The film has a beautiful score and is wonderfully animated. It almost looks as if 'Princess Mononoke' could have been inspiration for James Cameron's 'Avatar'. As the film developed, it also felt like a 'Lord of the Rings' fantasy adventure. Japanese anime are nothing like Hollywood animation. Due to the film's violent nature I can't really recommend it for kids. This is also a long movie that might challenge a kid's attention span. 'Princess Mononoke' is for a mature audience.'Princess Mononoke' just gets better and better as the film progresses, and delivers a fantastic action-packed climax.

Instead I got a boring but beautiful piece of work that honestly isn't worth watching. Characters - None of the characters have any personalities or depth. Everyone has one motivation to do a thing because of the plot. There are no complex relationships or interesting exchanges between the characters. The villain wants to destroy the forest because she wants to. The hero wants no one to die because that's what he wants. The creatures want to protect the forest because they want their home to remain. It's quite unfortunate that the writers just forgot that to make a story interesting, everyone needs reasons for doing what they do and not ""because movie."" Plot - this movie's story is a bit vague and pointless. Basically some people want the forest to die, the forest is against this, they fight, no one wins. It's pretty simplistic and uninteresting. There's a pointless romance thing in there and some other random story threads that mean nothing. Animation - this movie is absolutely gorgeous. I wish that the animators could've animated something good. They're clearly talented and it's sad to see such talent wasted on such a garbage and meaningless story.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Schro","25 May 2008","This is one of the most overrated anime movies of all time. I think most of the high ratings comes from people who were either stunned by the animation or give it a 10 just because it's anime. If you don't believe me about the second part, just type in the name of any generic shallow shonen anime and I can almost guarantee it will have at least a 7/10 rating. *cue 1000 ""No this review was not helpful"" clicks* To get this out of the way: The animation is great and overall it's not a bad movie. It's worth a watch. However it's also really slow and dull in many parts plot wise. There are several times where I just wished it would get to the climax so the movie would end. The main characters are pretty 2 dimensional(San and Ashitaka) and I found myself wishing that the movie would spend time on the side characters who are more interesting. San is the heroine who was raised by wolves and hates humans. If you've seen any anime with a generic tsundere(Wikipedia if you don't know what I mean) girl then you basically know her character and everything she'll do right away. Ashitaka is the hero who really has no back story and has a painfully dull ""PLEASE EVERYONE STOP FIGHTING"" personality. The point of the movie, like a few of Miyazaki's other movies is that the environment is cool and we shouldn't burn plastic in our full size SUVs while spraying aerosol cans out the window. While that's not a bad message for a movie to tell, Princess Mononoke does it really heavy handedly and seems like it wants to make you feel bad for human progress.Anyway, most of this ranting is to offset the hundreds of ""THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST THING EVER"" reviews and I honestly don't dislike the movie THAT much. I just think it could be a lot better for what the hype surrounding it promises.","

The monsters, creatures, gods, demons, animals, backgrounds and what ever else I've missed are top quality. It certainly gives the feeling of an animated illustration.The story is good too. It goes back to the struggle of nature versus man. Throw in some gods, demons, curses and magic to create quite a spectacle.I found only two major weaknesses in the film.1) Some of the voices for the English version are horribly miscast. I would rather have heard an expert, non-famous, voice actor than some of the star-studded cast choking their way through the dialog.2) The ending was rather weak. It still didn't clearly wrap up the story and the destiny for each character. Some were clear, while others were not. I won't say more. I don't want to spoil it.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","SAMTHEBESTEST","7 January 2024","Princess Mononoke (1997) :
Brief Review -An outstanding achievement in telling a long-narrated fantasy through animation. Hayao Miyazaki Cinema has a separate fan base. Some of his films are hailed as all-time classics, and even though I disagree with it, I still found some of them really good, and some are very good. I don't want to get into the Miyazaki fandom battle and watch his films as a neutral because I believe I can't be stuck with one filmmaker and his style when I have 50 more and bigger legends from world cinema to explore. I won't even waste time mentioning his other movies and my views since I have already written separate reviews. Let's talk only and only about Princess Mononoke in brief. So, it's a long narrative, like I said, and that's what makes it different from other animated flicks. Hollywood has made us accustomed to 90- to 100-minute animated movies, and they have been highly impressive, especially Disney and Pixar. That's why Miyazaki cinema is different. He takes the story round and round, visits every corner, confuses you with over-the-head theories and numerous characters, and then adds human/animal emotions to it. Princess Mononoke is a fine example of that long and difficult storytelling. It's an outstanding achievement when it comes to execution and vision. The visual effects look real, not fiction, because the filmmaker has convinced you to believe in that fictional world. At the end, there are emotions that flow just the same through humans and animals' blood. It's a story of human vs. Animal, civilization vs. Forest, and it's all set in a fantasy world. The hero and heroine are both underage, which makes the story relatable to a smaller age-group audience. Despite the longer runtime and a few drawbacks in the climax, Hayao Miyazaki delivers an A-class product in his own genre. This one can be skipped by others, but not by those who love Hayao cinema.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.","

They also made it engaging while at the same time teaching a lesson about humans and nature living in harmony. People who don't like the Anime genre, will still find this a worthwhile movie to watch.

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","clarkaaron-98947","23 May 2023","Truly a fantastic movie. The visuals, the characters, the plot, soundtrack, all compelling. As I said, not only is this the best animated movie I've ever seen, it's one of the best movies I've seen period. Definitely a top 10 all time favorite for me.If any movie is proof that animation is a viable medium for serious films, this, along with Studio Ghibli's other great movie Grave of the Fireflies, is it. But not only is this proof that animation is merely viable - it is also a perfect example of how animation can sometimes be the better medium for a movie than live action. This would likely be cumbersome as a live action movie.Princess Mononoke is great because of its animation, not despite the fact that it's animated. The drawings of the wolves and landscapes and the Nightwalker are simply sublime. Add the fact that it's largely hand-drawn and it becomes even more awe-inspiring - this movie is art.I'd recommend this to any lover of great movies and would urge anybody with reservations about animation as a medium for serious, adult-skewing movies to give this masterpiece a chance.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","sophiavladimirovna","15 November 2008","It may be true that the only similar film I have watched is 'Sprited Away', but I think I can still say that 'Princess Mononoke' is something worthy of being called art. The plot simply glitters with such complexity, thoughtfulness, maturity and action, that makes even the best of Western animation seem like child's play. The story carries a powerful, yet not preaching, ecological message, asking the question of why the human and the animal worlds cannot live in peace with one another. And what is remarkable, is that there is no true villain: all the characters, as well as the storyline, are very ambiguous. Some of the film's beauty also lies in the fact that the action is NOT non-stop: it is often the quiet, tender scenes that capture the viewer's attention. The animation, being of course chiefly hand-drawn, is nothing short of exquisite. From the calm beauty of the forest pools to the smoke and grime of the iron factories, not a single minute detail is overlooked. The characters, be they humans, stately animal gods, cute but eerie tree spirits, hate-filled apes or simply mice, insects and raccoons, all possess a certain beauty and credibility that is not always easy to come by in this day and age. The soundtrack is spine-tinglingly beautiful. And oh, the power of the silence as the Forest Spirit approaches, plants springing up in his wake... However, I must add a word of caution: this film lives up to every ounce of its PG-13 rating. The story and visuals are dark, violent and disturbing at times: People and animals alike are slaughtered in vast numbers with arrows, rifles, hand cannons and mines; profusely bleeding giant boars are invaded by tentacled demons. Death, as well as rebirth, and the horrors of war, are recurring themes. And the film is over two hours in length, so some children may become bored and confused by the plot. But do not be put off by this: 'Princess Mononoke' is pure brilliance from start to finish.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","sol-","2 September 2017","Attacked by a wild boar and infected by the madness that drove the boar insane, a young warrior stumbles upon a war between human villagers and intelligent wildlife in this animated drama from the imagination of Hayao Miyazaki. The film benefits from having no clear-cut villains or heroes; both the humans and the wildlife merely want to use the same territory for their own means and the project as such comes with some positive ecological messages in terms of trying to be sustainable and live in harmony. The most fascinating character is the title one though - a human raised by wolves as one of their own. Oddly enough, considering that the film is named after her, the Princess is only ever a supporting character in the proceedings. Furthermore, the film only ever lightly touches on the intriguing personal identity issues that come with being raised as something that one is not. Fortunately, the infected warrior is a curious enough character with his resilience in the face of impending death that the film still chugs along well. It is also refreshing to see an animated fantasy film that dares to show graphic carnage in order further the story-line. If not quite as dark and impressively nightmarish as 'Watership Down', this Japanese offering certainly comes close to it. In short, this is a relatively engrossing tale if not nearly the best thing that Miyazaki has ever done.","

There is a general tendency among adult audience to not take animation seriously, but I would be shocked if this movie did not leave a huge impact on anyone. This is one of my first reviews on IMDb, this movie has to be watched and internalized by everyone who is concerned about her future. If anything can move humanity to not inflict further harm and damage against mother Nature, it is this movie. If mother Nature had a form,it would closely resemble what Miyazaki has created in this movie. Even the thought of this movie chokes me, the stark unending sadness truly captures what Nature's wildlife is going through because of human activities. If humans ruin the planet in the near future to the extent that it becomes unlivable for all, this movie has the exact elements which can guide us all.","

A masterpiece is ineffable, much more than the sum of its parts. It's not that every part of it is perfect, far from it inevitably, but the whole is transcendent, and as such it transcends even its own limitations and problems. The characters in Princess Mononoke are living and breathing, full of life and profundity. It is partly in the characters themselves, and partly in the way the movie gives us to understand them. Through voice acting (the English version is marvelous, I can't speak for the original), music, dialogue, facial expressions and body language, and more. The imaginary world's symbolism doesn't let us down either, as do most. It is wonderfully coherent and rich.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","matthewssilverhammer","20 July 2018","Don't be fooled by the outward appearances of Princess Mononoke. Don't be fooled by the Studio Ghibli tag, or the Disney distribution, or its princess-fantasy genre, or the animated format. This is far from a kid-friendly film. It's intentionally paced (aka ""slow), jarringly violent (decapitation, ripped-off limbs, intense physical transformations), and almost oppressively heavy in tone. It's also one of the most lush, colorful, and beautiful creations of Miyazaki's astounding career, combining his undeniable animation skill and boundless imagination with overwhelming success.
Oddly enough, Mononoke isn't our protagonist here. Instead we follow Ashitaka, a recently cursed Prince who, in his search for a cure, finds himself mixed up in a battle for the future of the forest and its inhabitants, both animal and spiritual. Its effortless mixture of compelling story, well-placed humor, naturalism and fantasy is like great literature, only told with unspeakably perfect hand-drawn animation. Each cartoon cel and 2D creation is given its own character, style and care. Possessed-like apes with blurry skin. Cute but unsettling forest nymphs with Picasso-inspired faces. Snake-like demons drowning giant boars, personified wolves and blood-covered humans with chaotic precision. 
Not that its all style and no substance. Miyazaki and writer Neil Gaiman are running the gamut on thematic presence here, much of which will be familiar specifically in the bible belt. Fate versus chance, the relentless power of hatred, the danger of false prophets, the difficult power of choosing good, life springing up from death, the frustration inherent in being an ephemeral creature. It's all presented with a wonderous mystery, only suffering from moments of over-explanation. Princess Mononoke represents an entirely imaginative spirit rarely surpassed in storytelling.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","drqshadow-reviews","25 June 2020","I'm convinced this is the film Studio Ghibli spent its early years building up to. While previous efforts like Castle in the Sky and My Neighbor Totoro contained mythical elements - sleepy deities, spritely spirits, magic-tinged talents - the influence of god-level beings often feels secondary, relegated to a few enchanting (yet fleeting) glimpses. In Princess Mononoke, such divine creatures are essential, active participants. They speak, argue, swing their weight around. We aren't left to guess about their opinions or motivations, because their words and actions carry such a resonant influence. It's mesmerizingly effective, a contrast between the seemingly petty concerns of human tribes and the mass and muscle of a much heavier entity.Mononoke represents a huge step up for the studio, particularly in that sense of scale. Rather than maintaining the quaint, intimate essence that typified their early output, this time Ghibli has gone sweeping and epic. Everything, from the ambitious, enveloping symphonic score to the wide, gorgeous landscapes and distinct environs, emphasizes this point. We've left the village to find there's a broad undiscovered world out there. Yet the distinguishing little touches and unspoken human gestures haven't been lost in the transition, either. It still looks and feels like a Miyazaki movie, calmingly earnest and heartstrong, but the canvas is larger and more potentially powerful. And man, do they make the most of that promise.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","dfranzen70","13 July 2016","Hayao Miyazaki, the animation legend who brought to you such awesome films as Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away, and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, strikes again with this eco-friendly tale about the struggle between man, animal, and god within a deep, dark Japanese forest.Prince Ashitaka (voice of Billy Crudup) of the Emishi, stricken with a curse foisted upon him by a rampaging wild boar that was possessed by a demon, heads west upon his trusty golden elk Yakul to find a cure. He's also out to possibly save his people, as the appearance of the demonic boar portends grave consequences for the village – the gods and demons are reclaiming the forest.Ashitaka attempts to buy some food in a neighboring town with a gold nugget, but the shopkeepers do not quite believe that the nugget is a valid form of currency. Our fair prince is saved from further embarrassment by a monk named Jigo (Billy Bob Thornton), who offers his assistance to Ashitaka. Ashitaka learns from Jigo of a town called (in the English version, anyway) Iron Town, since they mine iron. Jigo also mentions that the forest gods still dwell around Iron Town, a fact that is certainly not lost on Ashitaka. He heads out the next morning.Meanwhile, a long column of men and oxen, carrying rice back to Iron Town to feed the denizens, is attacked by two giant wolves – one of whom bears a masked girl. Leading the men is Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver), who orders her men to fire their brand-new muskets at the wolves. The wolves are driven off, but their mama, named Moro (Gillian Anderson) soon arrives and lays everyone to waste. Half of Lady Eboshi's men fall off the mountainside.Further down the mountain, Ashitaka hears the battle above and comes across two men in the river. He pulls them out (one unconscious, the other with a broken arm) and carries them both through the ancient forest to Iron Town. On the way to Iron Town, Ashitaka encounters the wolves and the girl by the river side. The girl is San, the Princess Mononoke, i.e., the Angry Princess. Why is she so angry? Because Lady Eboshi has been killing all of the animals, which has been causing the forest to fall into disrepair and has angered the forest gods. She kind of has good reason to be mad.The reception at Iron Town is mixed, as many distrust the newcomer Ashitaka. Ashitaka learns that everyone in the village helps mine the iron, with the women operating the mighty bellows themselves. Lady Eboshi also explains that San really has it in for her (because of the forest damage Eboshi's caused) and that when the Forest Spirit himself is dead, San will become human (although to the viewer she looks perfectly human as it is). San, raised by wolves, is not on board with this eventuality.All of which leads to everyone fighting everyone, with mass destruction guaranteed. Iron Town is under siege by Lord Asano and his samurai, who wish to control the iron ore. The Iron Town citizens are left to defend themselves against Asano while Eboshi and Jigo the monk seek out the Forest Spirit; Jigo has a letter from the Emperor himself that guarantees a large sum of money if Jigo can bring the Forest Spirit's head to the Emperor (who believes it will grant him immortality). Then there are an entire tribe of huge wild boars who want to avenge the death of one of their own – the boar that wound up cursing Ashitaka to kick all of this off – as well taken on the humans for being humans. Oh, and apes who also want to kill the humans, particularly Ashitaka, whom they want to eat so they can gain his strength.There's plenty of action, in other words. In fact, the violence is a bit more explicit than you might expect in an animated film. When Ashitaka is first dealing with his curse, he fires an arrow at a soldier who is attacking him; the arrow cuts the man's arm clean off. Ashitaka doesn't know his own strength, it would seem. There's also a fair amount of blood, and a couple of particularly icky scenes: one in which San removes a bullet from Moro by sucking out the blood and spitting it out and another in which San helps Ashitaka eat by first chewing beef jerky and then passing it to him by mouth (he's very weak, you see). I understand, but eww.Princess Mononoke has plenty of strong-willed characters, and many of them are female: San, Lady Eboshi, and Moro, plus Ashitaka and Jigo. The Forest Spirit is a wonder to behold, too, appearing to be part human, part ape, part deer, and probably parts of lots of other animals as well. And the visuals are about what I expected from the maestro Miyazaki, although I think they weren't quite as well developed as they were in some of his other works, like the earlier Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. And it's also possible that there are just too many characters and plot lines and conflicts in Princess Mononoke to easily track. But overall, this is an unquestionable triumph of animation.","

The film, which is set in a magical and immersive universe, chronicles the adventure of Ashitaka, a young warrior cursed by a boar demon, as he negotiates the intricate relationships between the ancient spirits of the forest and industrial progress. The story takes on a complex structure as it presents people who defy stereotypes, especially Princess Mononoke, the ferocious and mysterious lead who is torn between the worlds of the living and the dead.The film's amazing animation and stirring soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi combine to create an ethereal ambiance that raises the storytelling to previously unheard-of levels. From the gorgeous vistas to the intricate details of the woodland spirits, every frame demonstrates Miyazaki's painstaking attention to detail. ""Mononoke-hime"" delves into topics of environmentalism, humanity's relationship to nature, and the fallout from unbridled greed and industrialization. It is more than just an animated film; it is a philosophical and artistic extravaganza.

I didn't realize that there were many other Ghibli films outside of Totoro and Spirited Away. I also was amazed at the depth of this film.Mononoke features a beautiful score and animation art as expected of the studio. However, it goes far beyond that and tells of a complex story. I won't bother explaining the detailed summary but will in a couple sentences. Prince Ashitaka tries to create a world where the natural world and the technological, industrial can coexist. It's open to interpretation whether he succeeded in that. What's fascinating is that this film does not feature a typical human vs nature environmentalism narrative, where humans are portrayed as the antagonist and nature as the protagonist. It shows that the ""human"" side is not only greedy and ambitious, but also compassionate and caring, characterized by Lady Eboshi. The ""nature"" side mostly is composed of suffering animals at the hand of human technology, but also features the ""God of Forest"", who ends up consuming most of the things in its way, hence also coined ""God of Death"".In this complex conflict, I resonate a lot to what Miyazaki was trying to say - ""Yet, even amidst hatred and carnage, life is still worth living. Is it possible for wonderful encounters and beautiful things to exist.""Nothing in life is black and white, even in this crusade for environmentalism. Princess Mononoke tells us to find the beauty in the gray and live for the wonder of life. Hopefully, I can live in that way as well.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","fujbrosinc","28 May 2015","An epic, gripping, defining form in anime at a transcendent level. I was instantly taken away from reality and was delved into this beautiful world. The chemistry between San and Ashitaka are perhaps the biggest of interests in the film. The artwork is meticulous. Studio Ghibli is employed with wizards of anime who always seem to blow us away with their style. Strong characters and dialogue.(all languages voiced excellently, by the way)And an intelligent, emotional story.(yet confusing for some)All together make in my opinion one of the greatest animated films of all time. Easily one of my favorite anime films. A must see for any fan of animation.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Squidd","22 October 1998","The king of Japanese animation displays his (as of yet) most carefully crafted work.  As in all his movies, the audience must be prepared to enter into a magical world, where the background scenes are beautifully painted in a realistic manner, but are imaginary and fantastic...  To be taken to a mythical Japan where wolves have two tails, where forests are inhabited by head-ticking spirits, and where boars can be cursed with hatred, seems at first to be an exciting adventure.  But we find that this world is all too real.  At the center of this epic is a battle between man and nature. People kill animals and trees... as well as each other.  Trees are burned for iron, iron is used for guns, and the guns are used for war.  People die, animals die, and spirits die.  But Miyazaki is a messenger of hope.  He claims to want to show children not how the world is, but how it could be. His characters are neither evil nor good, and so they allow for change. Disney could learn from this.  The magic of Disney lies in its abiltiy to tell happy tales of good people vs. evil people.  The magic of Miyazaki lies in his philosophy.  His love for craft, and his relentless passion for animation and story-telling allows him to produce movies that are original and breathtaking.  The effort that he places in the creation of his art guarantees that his work is worth watching, at least once.  And for that effort, we as an audience should put in the proper effort to try and understand what this director is getting at, as well as the effort of appreciating the animation itself.  There are scenes in this movie that Disney cannot do (at least not yet) simply because of the technique. Miyazaki deserves a place with the masters.  He has shown that animation is no child's play.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","dnaeye","29 October 1999","This film works like clockwork and is spotless as a silicon chip in a vacuum-sealed semiconductor lab. Granted it's not as epic as ""Nausicaa"", the superb action sequences, the terrific accompanying score by Joe Hisashi, and the gritty harshness of its dramatic themes made ""Princess Mononoke"" a much tighter package, as well as a more elaborated version of the message put forth in ""Nausicaa."" I understand that Miramax's distribution and marketing of the film up to this point has been rather low-key, but I hope somehow this film will reach enough people to make a change in the mindset of the American public. A note to parents, this is not ""My Neighbor Totoro"" or ""Kiki's Delivery Service."" There is some violence in ""Princess Mononoke"" which may startle younger audiences.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","dannystyran","7 August 2006","I think that princess mononoke is a fantastic piece of cinema, it is inventive and moving, and the animation is incredible.Basically, this is a story of a cursed young warrior trying to find a cure. A demon mark spreads over the boys arm and changes him, mentally and physically. The relationship between the people of the iron town, and the inhabitants of the forest show to the viewer that if we don't respect nature, then it will fight back, and we will not win. I think that this message holds up with the modern day attitude to nature, and will make viewers think about how we treat the earth, and how we can change our ways...","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Filmboy-14","21 January 2000","Princess Mononoke is the most breathtakingly artistic film I have ever seen. It ranks among Fantasia and Pinocchio as the greatest animated films ever made.  The story line is beautiful and complex.  It's not your normal, boring, conventional, and predictable Hollywood plot that everyone seems to want nowadays.  Some people had trouble with Princess Mononoke, I think, because there are no real good guys and bad guys.  You can't really take sides, every character has different motives with good and bad intentions. But that's one of the things I liked about Mononoke.  It's not the good old simplistic Disney tale where there is a definite good and evil.  Princess Mononoke is not about good vs. evil, or even man vs. nature, but about how we should all reach a certain compromise and try to work together and help each other.  You won't find too many themes like that in movies, especially animated features.  Princess Mononoke is not for small children, not just because of the violence, but because it will probably go way over their heads.  It is geared toward adults and older audiences.  The love story between San and Ashitaka is very subtle, moving, and even profound.  It's not conventional Hollywood.  Princess Mononoke is #1 on my ten best films of the year list because I believe it is a landmark feat in the animation genre.  I think it will eventually change the way Americans look at animation; that it's not just limited to the family and small children, but can be for adults and only for adults.  Mononoke shows that animation is just another form of expressive filmmaking, it can show things on film that could not possibly be filmed in live action.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","tuomas_gimli","16 November 2012","If Studio Ghibli's fantasy films were a menu, Nausicaä and Laputa would serve as appetizers for the main course which is Mononoke. It is a grim, adult fantasy epic which deals with heavy themes in a mature way. It doesn't ask simple questions, nor does it give simple answers and its only moral shades are of grey. It is fantasy fiction at its finest, and magnificently realized.Which sadly makes the few flaws it has all the more apparent.Mononoke has a theme of man vs. nature. However, instead of going the Avatar route, Mononoke presents both sides as fully fleshed out, and neither of them seems better or worse than the other. This is perhaps Mononoke's greatest strength: real-feeling moral ambiguity where wrong and right are shady at best.Mononoke has also a multitude of other things going for it: the animation and art are gorgeous, and don't seem dated in any way. The music is among Joe Hisaishi's best, and that is not something you can say lightly. The action scenes are perhaps the most visceral and thrilling in all of the Ghibli films, and Miyazaki's imagination outdoes 99% of mainstream cinema.Mononoke has only two major flaws, but sadly they can't be ignored. The first is the main characters: they're believable and well developed, but there's an odd lack of emotion to them. Ashitaka, for example, doesn't seem to display much else than cold indifference or steely determination. I also would have liked the hinted romance to have been explored a bit more. It clearly is there, why not go for it? The second, and biggest, problem with the film are its around last 45 minutes. In short, the whole story and all plot threads are solved in one long, intense action sequence which takes up most of the film's second half. The intensity is kept high for the whole time with little pause for breath, and eventually it does get tiring. I think it could have been done better. Also the ending feels quite abrupt after the long action sequence, as the ""what happened next?"" question is answered with only a few short scenes, and then we cut to the credits. There could at least have been an image montage during the credits like in Totoro.Recommendation: Despite my criticisms, Mononoke is in the end a great film and practically obligatory to see for any who consider themselves anime fans. Must-see for Ghibli fans, heartily recommended for anyone else","

The story is really great and interesting with a warrior journey to get rid of a demon inside of him and discovered something different. I really like the allegory of the balance between humans and nature with how neither sides are evil and they have they own reason why they against each others. Each characters works really well and have strong development towards them. The animation looks beautiful with the background, characters, animals, and the details they put onto them. It also have a couple of suspenseful moments in it during the action scenes.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","sharky_55","19 September 2017","Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke is big, brash and lyrical, bringing together several different ancient worlds into a new order where co-existence seems impossible. The film has been called the Star Wars of the east, but surely it is more than simply that, with a confidence and fluidity in its action-driven world building that immediately signals to us that these clans have existed for a very long time, and want to desperately continue that tradition. Then one day man discovered that iron ore could be forged into new and powerful tools, and the earth was broken to excavate it, and lines were drawn in the sand. Miyazaki has never been shy about his moral lessons. His debut Nausicaa, from way before Studio Ghibli was even established let alone a household name, pitted its eponymous heroine in a post-apocalyptic wasteland where toxic fumes (man-made, presumably) had corrupted nature and its beasts, and only underground gardens housed plant life. Here in Mononoke you can see its influence from the beginning, in the way that the boar god Nago has been corrupted by an iron ball shot into his stomach, and how the evil spirits writhe and attempt to consume him. Their movements, each individually hand-drawn, become a furious, teeming mass that is immediately reminiscent of the gigantic, mutated Ohm with their churning legs. Like the Ohm, Nago is an intelligent creature that has been reduced to baser instincts because of humanity's stain. The apes likewise have taken on a hellish appearance, and resorted to eating unnatural things. Made 13 years later, Mononoke is Nausicaa but matured in almost every way. You could never equal the original imprint of 80s tone and mysticism, backed up by a Joe Hisaishi score that found beauty in the strange, alien landscape (the haunting children's choir is a testament to that). But the allegorical tapestry of Mononoke has no animated equal; it attempts no less than to account for every horse in the race for the forest, and in doing so lifts early didacticism into a universal fable. Seeing it on the big screen for the first time, I marvel again at the artistry of Ghibli's animators. They twist beauty and corruption into one with their matte backgrounds; the whole damn world is under the curse of evolution and technological advancement, and the untouched nature is slowly bearing its scars. An early shot of an oxen delivery inching its way across a spiky mountain range and fog is reminiscent of the magnificence of Herzog's Aguirre, and how the opening dwarfs its tiny humans. In the midst of pure streams, still lakes and thick forests they draw cartoon violence that is undeniably shocking for the medium. Even Ashitaka trembles at how his corrupted arm lends him an otherworldly strength that allows his arrows to cleanly behead a chasing samurai. The pale Kodama seem cute at first, until they twist their heads all the way around and shiver, sending unease down our spines. And no one animates emotion quite like Miyazaki. When his characters run, they stumble and grasp for the ground, and almost leave skid marks turning corners. There's no run cycle in sight. Look how he evokes anger through the whole body; eyes widen, brows arch like caterpillars, hair bristles up as if charged with electricity. But nothing quite compares to the anger of the forest spirit in search of his stolen head from the invaders of his domain. Watching it I am filled with both thrill and fear; to have Miyazaki unleash the figurative fury of mother nature is to rebuke all previous images of the serene, gentle spirit. Does it simply give in to those who are poisoning the land? No, it has lived in peace for millennia and has not yet been challenged by individuals so powerful and careless at the same time. It launches a self-destructive last resort. It seeks to consume. There is Miyazaki's caution of the modern world, of its unchecked progress and uncertainty, but this time around he also sees how it can bring new life for those previously downtrodden. Lady Eboshi rescues the women from filthy brothels and gives them good, hard work, and entrusts to the marginalised lepers the most important job of them all. She is not simply evil incarnate, but perhaps short-sighted. Her arrogance in her tools leads her to believe that she can kill a god, and she loses a hand for this. But she learns, and the town grows again. Ashitaka and San are the ones to bring true balance to the war. San herself is a discarded product of the conflict, neither fully wolf nor human. She reacts initially with an almost animalistic, blind rage, like that Okkoto, who has been fighting too long to see sense. And in the end, although she comes to accept that their must be give and take for both sides, cannot forget what the humans have done on behalf of progress. It is refreshing to see a film not so easily discard its character's convictions. A western film might have poised the romance as dramatic resolution. Yet Ashitaka knows that such atrocities are not quickly forgotten, and that only time can begin to heal them. One day that seedling may become a tree.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","El_Rey_De_Movies","7 April 2008","Disney has always dominated the animation market here in the States with their popular, streamlined, well-crafted series of films aimed at children with a little extra thrown in to keep the parents interested. But it's a different story in Japan, and one look at ""Princess Mononoke"" will show you the exact reasons why. Whatever you may think about Japanese animation (or ""anime"", as it's popularly known), one thing you have to understand is that it's definitely NOT aimed at children, and that the level of animation is far superior to anything the House of Mouse has ever produced. This film, which I consider one of the greatest ever made, is the story of young Prince Ashitaka. While defending his tribe from a rampaging demon, he is infected with its' venomous hate. The infection is lethal, and the only hope for Ashitaka is to leave his ancestral lands, venture into the west, see what caused the entity that attacked his people to turn into a demon, and ""to see with eyes unclouded by hate"". His journey takes him to Irontown, a village of miners and metalworkers, and their struggle with the Great Forest Spirit. At that point, it becomes a moral fable about how humans coexist (or more often, fail to) with the natural environment and the price that they pay for trying to control the elements of nature. It's a tremendously fast-paced and exciting story, full of strong and well-rounded characters voiced convincingly by the likes of Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Gillian Anderson, Minnie Driver, Jada Pinkett-Smith and Billy Bob Thornton. The animation can only be described as jaw-droppingly beautiful. If you've never heard of director Miyazaki or have never seen anime, this is the place to start.","

In total, all Miyazaki's films have a criticism over humanity: how it uses nature for its own purposes and how humanity fights among itself. Ashitaka, the main protagonist serves as the negotiator between both sides and tries to make peace. His character resembles everything that is pure and good in humanity. San, Mononoke hime is a fighter and resembles rage and fury. This film has an important message and is considered among the best anime films ever made.","

The animations is superb, the soundtrack is amazing, and the story is one you will remember forever.

I can never watch it without wishing we had someone like Miyazaki-sama here in the States, or that we had more of his films on DVD, or that this movie had gotten the mainstream theatrical distribution it deserved.  If Disney had been smart enough to release this film subtitled, with a real advertising campaign, it could have been more successful than Crouching Tiger.  There's a reason why this is the highest-grossing Japanese film of all time, and if its distributors had handled it better it could have won Best Foreign Film.  Hell, it should have won Best Picture for 1997, and Jo Hisaishi ABSOLUTELY deserved the Best Original Score award. 
But none of that happened.  And that's why it's so hard to watch.  Because Mononoke Hime is the best film of all time, and most Americans will never bother to see it.","

I admire that the movie manages to contain so many story elements while it also keeps its structure intact. I think it struggles a bit with its pacing in the second act, but other than that, it's intriguing. It's my first animation movie that has such brutal violence and I love it. It makes the action and its outcomes much more realistic and darker. Although comedy isn't its biggest genre, it also has a nice touch of it because it decorates the story in an entertaining way. In terms of story, I think it has a good balance of character development, divinity, mystery and action. The world-building feels enormous and small at the same time, but it's the animation that mainly holds onto your attention. The movie also has a very good use of its sounds, especially when it comes to the epic action, like the scenes with the gods. So overall, this was a great watch!While this movie might stumble slightly in pacing, its breathtaking animation, immersive story, and impactful action sequences solidify it as a must-watch. The intricate balance of character development, mythical elements, and humor keeps the narrative engaging, while the masterful sound design and world-building elevate the experience. Its darker themes and violence also help to make the movie an entertaining and thought-provoking experience.","

Unlike many animated films, that are aimed to children, ""Mononoke Hime"" is a epic story, filled with elements of tragedy, adventure and heroism, and all beautifully told by one of the masters of the animation that is Miyazaki. Every single frame of this movie has a unique beauty, and all the characters, humans or animals are very likable and interesting. This movie isn't overrated.

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","alasdairdavidson1987","9 January 2007","This film would be inside the top 10 films of all time were people in the west only more aware of it. In England we grow up on an unappealing diet of Disney tripe, but we don't realise it is so shoddy because it's all we have. This is because we don't have a strong animation industry of our own really, with the possible exception of Aardman Animations, and we are gripped by America's commercial stranglehold. The lower classes in this country love America and anything it produces, because they are ignorant, pure and simple. The sad fact is that the average person in the street has not heard of Studio Ghibli or Miyazaki. Consequently they think that Disney films are the acme of animation, and show their children Disney films and take them on holidays to Disneyland. It was such a revelation for me to see my first Studio Ghibli film (Spirited Away) and when I watched more of Miyazaki's masterpieces, most notably Mononoke-Hime, I realised what animation can and should be. There still persists in this country the idea that animation is somehow a lower art form than live-action films, but the more people see this film, the more things will change. Using animation allows a director to fly effortlessly into the realms of fantasy, and Miyazaki is masterful at it. It amazes me that although western animation has been commercially successful for so much longer, the greatest imaginative leap the directors seem to able to make is talking animals. Brilliant. The Studio Ghibli films, however, are not afraid to make films where almost all of the characters are people (Kiki's Delivery Service) because they are not afraid to take on live-action films on their own territory - they don't feel the need to retreat to the safety of talking animals, where live-action will not usually follow. But the thing about Studio Ghibli films is that they have people and fantastical creatures in the same film, and what's more, interacting with one another.But I'm speaking too generally. Mononoke is for me the best of the best - see as many Studio Ghibli films as possible, but I think this one is the most brilliant. Personally I prefer the Japanese versions of Studio Ghibli films with the subtitles which match the Japanese script, because the American cast are pretty poor. It is definitely the most beautiful film I have ever seen, fantastically well drawn, but it doesn't hide behind a pretty facade. The story is cracking, great action scenes mixed with truly poignant ones, and the overall environmentalist theme of the story gets more and more relevant with every 8-mile-to-the-gallon American SUV sold.In a word: stunning. In two words: see it.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","avik-basu1889","23 May 2015","Hayao Miyazaki is a legendary name in the genre of anime film- making. What sets his films apart from the rest is the fact that although his films may be animated which is generally considered to be a cinematic medium directed towards kids, but he makes his films profound enough for adults to enjoy too. The kids will find the vibrancy of the visuals enjoyable while the adults will get enough thematic and allegorical depth. Princess Mononoke is no different.Miyazaki deals with the age-old relationship between human beings and nature. The movie I believe is set in Japanese Civil War era. Miyazaki beautifully uses the fantasy-like storyline to promote the messages of tolerance, coexistence and unity and the denouncement of hatred. Man and nature have the right to exist together without any harm coming to either. The script does get a bit too preachy at times, but the visual subtlety and beauty of the film overwhelms the minor issues with the script. The film could have been a little shorter. The film ends beautifully with optimism and with a hope for a new beginning. I had minor reservations with the script, but nevertheless the mastery of Miyazaki's film-making is visible throughout the film and Princess Mononoke is must watch for everyone irrespective of your feelings towards the genre of anime.","

There are always interesting characters to run into such as the small tree spirits, or the gigantic forest creatures.The message at the end is a bit preachy, but the idea and concept of living in harmony with nature is told well.  The story even makes it more interesting when they parable the infighting with some of the other forest creatures as to how they should deal with the encroaching humans.Not the best anime I have ever seen, but CERTAINLY not the worst.Rating 7 out of 10","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","J5iftY5iveXtreme","17 August 2005","From acclaimed animator Hayao Miyazaki (""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" ""Castle in the Sky,"" ""Porco Rosso,"" 2002's ""Spirited Away,"" the recent ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" etc., etc.) comes one of the late 90's most acclaimed films - ""Mononoke hime"" (better known by its English title, ""Princess Mononoke""). Taking place in Japan somewhere in the late medieval times to the early Renaissance in Europe (you can tell its time period since you see guns), this animated epic tells the tale of Ashi-taka, the young prince of a lost Emishi Tribe.The tale begins when Ashi-taka slays a boar demon and saves his village from that monster. But in slaying the beast, he gets cursed, and a wound appears on his right arm. In search for a cure, he journeys, with his ""red elk"" Yarraku, out from his village, never to return.He eventually comes upon Irontown, led by the feisty Lady Eboshi. He is welcomed in that town, and meets several people including Gozo, Eboshi's brute henchman, Toki, a feisty woman worker (like all the women in town, formerly a prostitute until Eboshi bought her freedom), and Toki's husband whom Ashitaka saved, Kohroku. It is in Irontown that Ashitaka learns that Eboshi was was the one who accidentally caused the boar demon to attack his village, since she shot the former animal god and caused it to become angry.Irontown is a modern town and its inhabitants produce rifles, cannons, and other modern weapons introduced to Japan by Westerners. Irontown, a symbol of machinery and metal, sits near an old forest inhabited by spirits and animal spirits, who constantly wage war against Irontown, whose citizens are constantly destroying the forest. It is in this forest that Ashitaka meets San, or, as the rest of Irontown calls her, Princess Mononoke. San was abandoned in the forest and raised by wolves, under the guidance of Moro, the wolf spirit of the forest. San hates human beings (even though she is one), and is determined, under the point of death, to protect the forest from human beings, who are constantly destroying it in an attempt to modernize Japan.San and her fellow nature-loving animals are at war with humanity. Amidst a series of events and many characters, lovable and loathsome, Ashitaka develops a close friendship with San and attempts to bring peace between man and nature.""Mononoke hime"" is a very complex film. Its script, handwritten by Miyazaki using his storytelling talent, is filled with many issues, mostly concerning the role of man in protecting and defiling nature. Although ""Mononoke"" may seem like a simple environmentalist film, its issues are actually deeper than that. The cast of characters is great, filled with lovable (and loathsome) people, all of which are three-dimensional. It's great that Miyazaki chooses to make his characters complex. There are no true good or bad guys in this story. Even the ""bad guys"" are have redeeming qualities. Eboshi, the leading antagonist of this tale, is actually a caring person and houses detested lepers, even giving them a life in Irontown.""Mononoke"" is a very fine film. The animation is gorgeous and beautiful to look at. While in the West, animators are resorting to CGI (i.e. Pixar films, and I love Pixar), Japan retains a traditional method of hand-drawn animation, and thank God for Miyazaki's genius! The score, too, is excellent, and the composer, Joe Hisaishi, is a genius. Combine the score with breath-taking cinematography, gorgeous hand-drawn figures, stylized action scenes, and a powerful story complete with memorable characters, ""Mononoke hime"" is a treat for every movie-goer. This is a mature film in terms of story and content. It even has a few (non graphic) be-headings and dismemberment's, earning it its PG-13 rating in the US.Originally released in Japan, this film featured Yôji Matsuda as the Ashitaka and Yuriko Ishida as the title character (Mononoke/San). It was translated into English, featuring the voices of Billy Crudup as Ashitaka, Claire Danes as San, Minnie Driver (in one of her few notable voice performances alongside Disney's ""Tarzan"") as Eboshi, Gillian Anderson (X-Files) as Moro, Billy Bob Thorton as greedy monk Jigo, and a large cast of English-speaking actors. This English version, alongside the Jap version, was a success. It remains today as one of the best animated features.Miyazaki, we salute you!134 minutes Rated PG-13 for images for violence and gore","

He is banished from his village and is told he will die,but might have a chance if he can find the spirit of the forest.On his journey he meets different people who all seem to have one track minds and he seems to be the only voice of reason in the whole film.He also meets a girl who can talk to animals and seems to be bloodthirsty for humans even though she's a human herself. That's maybe because she was raised by wolves,and that humans especially one B*tch in particular has been destroying the forest and animals just so she can make iron.Anyway this movie will definitely p*ss you off,and if that was it's intent it succeeded.Oh,but the ending SUCKED. I mean really could it have been any cheesier? Visuals: Looking at the visuals from a 2006 perspective they weren't all that great. Better than old Disney cartoon visuals,but definitely not better than anything that has been put out since we entered the new millennium.Characters: You will feel for the characters especially the main character.I quite liked him, and hated others. On a superficial note he has a sexy voice too.LoL! Bottomline: This movie is rather drama orientated,and really violent in some scenes. If you like those sort of things you'll fully like this movie. I have hated so far all this man's movies with the exception of Howl's Moving Castle.So for this movie to get a 5(Neutral) from me is saying something.Basically see this movie if you love drama.

I tried to change the channel but the remote controller was too far away from me so I decided to keep watching the film. It was Mononoke Hime.I leave in the bask country in Spain, where we have a terrorist problem (it looks like it is solved now), and I am tired of films in which when someone believes something, he/she must fight till death for that belief. This film says the opposite. When one believes something, one must GIVE in order to get the best solution to a conflict. This way of approaching a problem, cannot be better displayed than Ashitaka in the film. Wonderful. I've seen the film in Spanish so perhaps then sentence is different, but the one saying ""I've come to understand without being influenced by hate"" could be very profitable for human kind. After the film I watched all Miyazakies, and I must say that the only one that is almost as good as this one is Naussica. Regards","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","honeybounif","3 January 2024","When I was young, this film was more of a beautiful spectacle of animation rather than a interesting plot. The art to this film is beyond any doubt one of the best in animation history. This alone could make me rate this a 10/10 film, many could argue movies like your name or suzume could surpass the art. Hayoa miyazi prides himself in hand drawn animation, as seen in most of his films, and this to me brings this movie up a lot.Beauty of art aside, the plot to this film is insane. Though the only negative I would have is how slow the beginning is, putting a lot of people off. A plot where the character is neither in the ""good"" or ""bad"" and rather helps everyone and is then seen of a bad guy from both sides. The good and bad side is completely the choice of the viewer (though most would be on princess mononokes side).The antagonist to this film is arguably the most ambiguous character in the film. Is she really evil for the pain she has put on the land, or is she a good person for the service and valour she has given to her own kind?Hayao miyazi also produces well thought out, powerful female characters with faults and development that many films these days lack.There is so much to unpack in this film its ridiculous.I would generally call this film one of the best. And I recommend it 100%","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Bob Pr.","8 October 2000","(AKA English) ""Princess Mononoke""I'd read good reviews of this and long wanted to see it so got it when my local video shop had it. I found it worth seeing but a little uneven.Much of the artwork, especially of landscapes and atmosphere and weather, is stunning. Some of the artwork, to my taste, is too crude (e.g., as in the drawings of the wolf mother and sibs to Mononoke).Perhaps those growing up in Japanese culture absorb a supporting fabric that makes the story line more natural and understandable to them than to an American audience. I'm appreciative of the idea that it does not have to be Man vs. Nature (as some industrialists view it) -- that there can be a co-existence or maybe even a symbiosis? The storyline presented realistic conflict among the forces on both sides (nature & animal vs. man) but while the motives of the conflicts on the nature/animal side were understandable, those on the human side were far less so.*** WARNING -- SOME WILL FIND THE FOLLOWING SPOILS THE OUTCOME ***Generally, I often find story lines with supernatural forces are interesting, especially when they deal with moral issues as this does. I can accept that folklore has gods with different levels of power. But it did bother me that the supergod of all Nature, capable walking on water and special powers of healing, of transforming shape from day to night, of spreading out an ooze over the whole land that would injure humans, of living and functioning without a head -- that a god with such powers has a head that can be chopped off by humans and can not find it if humans keep it in a box.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","slowcando","17 June 2023","My first Ghibli. However I've seen a few japanese animes and have marvelled at their imagination. With the animated medium the imagination is the limit and Princess Mononoke is filled with unique (for westerners) ideas and plenty of memorable striking visuals: images like San's bloody mouth, the possessed bull, the face of the Deer God, the giant Night Walker roaming the forests, the harmless spirit creatures with lopsided heads, and many more.A feast for the eyes!The story is also pretty good: while at its core we get a standard tale of men-vs-environment (like Watership Down two decades prior to this) the way it's told is engaging and original. The characters are drawn & played so well that they're nicely individually identifiable (not always a given with japanese fiction). The ending is very fantasy with clear metaphors: a fine way to end even if a little cliché, as 'environmental' fantasy films go. There was room for more surprising or original ways to end the story but it didn't go there. Not really a complaint, just an observation.Note: i watched in original japanese with the 'literal translation' as subtitles which were ideal: short and to-the-point. I tried the english-dialogue first as subtitles but it was too wordy, and then as audio-dub but most of the actors sounded detached from the work (Keith David excepted). The japanese-audio is superior: the voices blend in nicely, and Moro (the 'mother' wolf) being voiced by an elderly male adds to the otherworldy factor which is missing when she's voiced by a bored Gillian Anderson.As my first Ghibli is a strong 8/10, I'll be watching another one soon!","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","harrylosborne","12 March 2020","Studio Ghibli almost exclusively produce great films, but Mononoke is more than just colours and smooth animation: it is a complex story of man's attempts to harness nature, and how it shouldn't be a conflict, but instead should be a symbiotic relationship. Using 14th century Japan as the vehicle for this story is perfect - as the nation undergoes an industrial evolution, the forest tries to fight back, and only Ashitaka (the main character) seems to see the full picture.For something animated as far back at 1997, Princess Mononoke looks immaculate. The quality of animation is second to none, and the creativity that went into the aesthetic and the environment is amazing. The accompanying soundtrack is very good: subtle enough not to override the delicacy of some scenes, but still lends sufficient power to more dramatic moments. There is also an abundance of decent voice actors too - Billy Crudup, Minnie Driver, John DiMaggio and many others lend their talents to this film, which makes the voice-dubbed version a painless experience.The story is both fantasy and action, a love story and a war film; so many elements combine for this plot, and the film is all the better for it. Loosely, the story follows a prince trying to find the cure for a curse inflicted upon him by a demon, but there is a lot more to it; the relationship between Ashitaka and Mononoke herself is one of both love and hate, since they both care too much for humans and the forest respectively to let one destroy the other.Words don't really do justice to just how good Princess Mononoke is. I know some people won't really understand just why I think this is such a masterpiece of cinema, but there is both nostalgia and emotional power to this film. I know for those that do connect with Mononoke, they will never forget this feature.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","krational66","14 April 2020","Good film, there are many layers, more and more people like, can not stop.
See environmental protection, only the outermost layer, this film is so good that more than a lot of people imagine, its level is very deep.
In the film, the core characters and their meaning, roughly speaking, the nature represented by mono no ke, the human society represented by the city woman (black hat), and the bystander or thinker represented by the bird (axidaka). In addition, there is the animal kingdom of the radical boar god, the human society of such organizations and so on.
The hero is a near-perfect character, kind and brave (he risked his life to save his family), strong and calm (he ran back and forth between forces at the last minute), big-hearted and big-hearted (the one in dadara). But only in this way can the tragic feelings be reflected. He said to sang, ""we have done our best,"" and held her in his arms, accepting the unknown ending, living or dying, all came like a verdict in that brilliant light. Yes, even if we open our hearts, sympathize with each other, and try our best, we will not be able to balance the conflicts in this world, because it is no longer the so-called desire and contradiction, but the most basic helplessness of life in this world -- heaven and earth are not benevolence, and all things are the dog.
The favorite character is actually the female Lord who represents human reason and desire. In fact, she is by no means avarice or a surrogate for industrial civilization. The film is definitely not an indictment of industrial civilization. She was not cutting mountains and trees for her own greed, but for something very basic: survival. Happiness or pain, even like a ghost in the sickbed to breathe, but also want to live, and live with a little more dignity. On this woman, reflected a lot of human noble character, not pleased by external gains, not saddened by personal losses, there is no romance of the moan, only resolute, indomitable adhere to. There is no wrong, people alive, is the acquisition of nature. As the population grows, human needs become a bottomless pit that cannot be filled, but that is no reason for the uncaring to die without a sound. If being alive means having power, then she's determined to do it. In the end, she did not collapse like the post-modern people in the face of the tragic outcome, but calmly ""start from scratch"". There is no wrong, people, like those weeds, also have tenacious vitality.
Sang, the strength of the portrayal, in fact, not as profound as the former two. But because she is behind, have white Wolf, wild boar, unicorn god and so on, so the strength of this aspect is also very strong. The difference between a Wolf and a wild boar is also intriguing. Just as humans have many different attitudes towards nature, so does the other side of the mirror. Impressive such as the dialogue between the white Wolf and the bird, accompanied by the bleak and distant music (long stone! , such a simple scene, actually absentminded between like an epic feeling.","

But the fact which has made the film somewhat confused for me is that there is no protagonist or antagonist in the film. The film explores the nature of all the people fighting for their own causes and that is what is beautiful in the film. But I could not attach myself with the film because of this thing may be.

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","JaydoDre","21 December 2013","Princes Mononoke is one of Hayao Miyazaki's high profile creations relatively well known in the West, which is not surprising considering its reserved adult tone and the down-to-earth ecological themes that should resonate with the Western audiences. Still, it is a complex epic with a high artistic level and it has a knack for holding the viewer's attention from start till finish.The film tells a story of a conflict between the forest Gods and humans into which the human protagonist is pulled as he comes searching for a cure for his worsening affliction. Although, it has a hippie tint to it, the story is not forcing any opinions and the characters are realistic with appealing personalities.The Japanese acting and its English dubbing are both notable. The makers tried to ensure a high quality conversion into English and even the songs are beautifully sung in English by Sasha Lazard. The English acting however isstrange. A lot of it is bizarrely devoid of emotion, far more than the original material, which is already relatively tame by Japanese animation standards. This is especially true for the main hero's dialogue.This detached English performance keeps coming back throughout the film in various characters and therefore seems to be intentional but it does not appear to be in key with the tone of the movie and, at some points, sounds out of sync with the emotions being portrayed by the characters' faces. As mentioned, the Japanese performance can also be very calm at times, but that calmness serves a purpose to underline someone's character or a particular situation and feels appropriate. The English monotony often does not.With some of the characters the English dub does feel weightier, most notably with the animals, but despite the efforts of such notables as Gillian Anderson the Japanese version still feels far superior.The personalities are all interesting, but the main character is a little unreal. He is a young person who is introduced to a new environment, but whenever it suits the movie, he somehow knows what is going on and what to do, with copious amounts of confidence and better than the characters who have been living at the location for a long time. It feels like the animators cut a few corners with his character not to make the already long movie even longer.The animation is awesome. Myazako is really all about that word, ""animation"". Everything feels alive. This life comes from a high attention to detail. Small and sometimes subtle movements breathe life into the side characters, some of whom will only occupy the screen for a few seconds , but they pass that life on to the rest of the film. These little imaginative details keep the viewer interested and drawn in.The high budget for the film shows in these details and in the fluidity of the animation. There are noticeably many frames of animation, not all the time but there where it matters. The visual transitions are also great, like the change from dry to rainy weather or from living to dead plants. These are made especially effective by sparing use of colour. Bright saturated colour in this film appears to be used primarily for contrast to indicate life or magic.The orchestral soundtrack complements the mood well most of the time, with an occasional recurrence of minimalistic taiko drums for extra contrast. I did notice a few scenes where the mellow music did not fit in with the action, but I know this is more to do with the Japanese cultural outlook on such type of action scenes.What is really good with both the music and other sound effects is that they are used sparingly and stop when appropriate. The lack of sound is used very effectively.If there is one point of contention it is the ending. It feels rushed. Once the movie comes to its conclusion you might realise that the motivations of different characters have not been fully explained. Considering how major the decisions they make are, it would really help to explain things in more detail. The last few events in the film and their consequences are also unclear. At this point the dialogue starts going off the track as well. One of the characters who failed at what he tried to achieve just happily accepts the outcome. The main hero starts uttering empty pretentiousness. Yet another character is just forgotten. Most of the issues the characters had do not get resolved. No lessons learned. The last few minutes of the film just feel mangled up and cut short.I feel the memory of this film in the fans may be a tad rose-coloured, but apart from a few story issues, Princess Mononoke is one of the greatest things you can see on the screen. The interesting details and good contrast in sound and visuals keep the viewer engaged. I want to say this film is what Ferngully should have been, but I feel like I am insulting Princess Mononoke by putting those two in the same sentence.","

Perhaps it's too difficult to be subtle with animation (or anime).The story was only mildly interesting.  It didn't have any epic qualities about it.  The animation may have been great but these days with computers helping them it's hard to be impressed by mere glitz.The scene near the end with the forest spirit turning into a headless monster gave me the feeling I was watching an animated variation on the Godzilla theme.Very run-of-the-mill overall I'd say.","

The era now ongoing flourished with a lot of 3D colorful and lively animated works, Princess Mononoke went back us to the late decades of 2D animation. We are all familiar with Disney as the king of animation and along with Dreamworks, Pixar, etc but this is from the 'manga' place that is called Japan. The place, setting, and the subject set back us the historical background of Japan. The movie points out the question regarding humans and nature. We are confused about the above question because we don't know what should consider important in the context. Whether we have to fix human above nature or vice-versa. The film smoothly approaches to that question and finds a mid to mid answer through the characterization of Ashitaka. Ashitaka stood along with both nature and humans. It's about the human greed for nature for the development of their society and culture at the same time the animals thriving to set their place. So, Princess Mononoke is for all kinds of film lovers who don't consider animation works as mere a simple kid watching process rather than an important film genre.","

With all the action, drama, and a side of forest spirits, ""Princess Mononoke"" is the kind of movie that makes me want to grab a bow, ride a giant wolf, and declare war on deforestation... or at least plant a tree in my backyard. 🌳So, whether you're an environmental enthusiast, a fantasy fanatic, or just someone who's into arm-wrestling with forest gods, ""Princess Mononoke"" will surely take you on a journey more epic than a squirrel's quest for the last acorn. It's a must-watch for anyone who's ever looked at a tree and thought, ""You know what? This definitely needs more wolves."" Five stars for the movie, minus half a star because there weren't enough singing mushrooms. 🍄🌟","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Motion-Picture-Watchmen","13 April 2022","Despite the title misleading the audience on the true protagonist of the story and sporadic Misandrist comments, this movie has a lot to offer.I particularly liked the protagonist, for his straightforward humility and respect for human life. His neutral stance on the conflict is not a sign of indifference and apathy, but of general discontent against killing and hate. This is only one sign of the complex storytelling. In fact, an additional layer of greatness and mature storytelling comes from the moral ambiguity, i.e. That the various characters and groups have believable, divergent motivations.The animation is marvelous as always, the colorful paintings being awe-inspiring. I would even go as far as to call it sublime. The visually weird Nightwalker at the end was quite off-putting, though.The movie is evidently allegorical in nature, underlying the fragile relationship between men and nature, the dilemma between development and preservation. This, in a time when our societies have become more eco-conscious, is highly appreciated.Furthermore, action ranges from simply thrilling to utterly epic, and its consequential nature gives it more depth. The violence was quite startling at times, though. The piano-heavy score is also solid.In conclusion, this film constitutes an impressive piece of filmmaking thanks to splendid animation and an immersive, captivating and riveting story.","
