"TANGLED","TheLittleSongbird","30 January 2011","I am a huge Disney and animation fan, and was really interested in seeing Tangled. For me Disney have so many classics under their wing, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Bambi, Pinocchio, The Little Mermaid and Aladdin especially. For over a decade, the past Disney films ranged from very enjoyable(Emperor's New Groove) to truly disappointing(Chicken Little)- The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Tarzan were the last ones to truly blow me away- until now.While Tangled had me interested, I didn't like how the film was advertised. The trailer looked as though the film would be a Dreamworks knock-off, and I didn't think much of the title either. I needn't have worried, Tangled was wonderful and Disney's best film in a while(I know I said that about last year's Princess and the Frog, yes I actually liked that too, but after seeing Tangled I've changed my mind). The film is so much better than its advertising suggested, it is not a knock-off of Dreamworks and more importantly it not only has the Disney magic but it has something for both kids and adults.What wowed me immediately about Tangled was the animation. It is simply gorgeous. The colours look beautiful, the backgrounds are stunning especially that surrounding Rapunzel's tower and the characters are very well modelled. The real revelations are with Rapunzel's hair, which is a masterstroke and also the floating lanterns, a scene of true beauty and very touching. Alan Menken's music was a surprise and in a good way. For me, this was his best score since The Hunchback of Notre Dame(that score is amazing), I was especially taken with the Kingdom Dance.The songs are also not bad at all, they are not quite instant classics like Colours of the Wind, Beauty and the Beast, When You Wish Upon a Star, Heigh Ho, Part of Your World, Circle of Life, Hellfire, Under the Sea, Whole New World and Bells of Notre Dame are, but they are listenable with beautiful melodies and surprisingly decent lyrics. The best for me were the stunning I See the Light and the goosebump-inducing Mother Knows Best.The writing is another strong asset. Tangled has some truly excellent writing, particularly with Flynn and Rapunzel, it is funny, witty and even touching. The storytelling is polished and is snappily paced, with the action sequences lively and the ending fitting well with the rest of the movie. When I saw the trailer I was expecting a story scattered with pop-culture references and almost laughter-free dialogue, but actually the storytelling does have a classic feel to it and some scenes like the aforementioned floating lanterns give the film its magic.I also loved Tangled's characters. Rapunzel is one sassy heroine and is also someone young girls in particular can relate to. Flynn is a charming, dashing and charismatic hero too, and his interaction with Rapunzel alone gives Tangled its spark. Mother Gothel is another strong character, in her character you can see shades of both Lady Tremaine and Frollo, and on top of that she is a very intriguing villainess. Even more surprising were the comic relief characters. There have been animated films/Disney films where the comedy either works like a glove(Emperor's New Groove), is either hit or miss(I say this with a heavy heart, Hunchback of Notre Dame) or doesn't work at all(Chicken Little). Here the comedy works perfectly, hilarious without being too over-the-top. Pascal is both hilarious and cute and Maximus the horse is a sheer delight in everything he does.The voice acting also adds a lot to the film. Mandy Moore is a perfect choice for Rapunzel, she has a pleasant speaking voice and a beautiful singing voice. I loved the charisma Zachary Levi brings to Flynn, his voice is one of the main reasons why Flynn is as likable as he is, while Donna Murphy is perfect as Mother Gothel.In conclusion, this was a wonderful film and I recommend it heartily for both kids and adults. For Disney fans too, I think you will be delighted, if you want humour, adventure, beautiful animation, good music, classic storytelling, witty scripting and likable characters, Tangled is a perfect match. 10/10 Bethany Cox","

"TANGLED","planktonrules","29 December 2010","I was frankly quite amazed by this film. After all, last year Pixar brought us ""Up"" and this year Dreamworks brought us ""How to Train Your Dragon""—there was no way that anyone could produce a CGI film that is every bit as good, could they?! Yet, surprisingly, I adored ""Tangled"" and enjoyed it just as much as these other films—showing that we are in a period of time when amazingly wonderful computer animation has become the norm.""Tangled"" is wonderful for two main reasons. Foremost, the animation style is so new and vibrant—and looks so much unlike all the other recent CG I films. I read that Disney deliberately tried to create a computer-generated film that looked a lot like a traditionally animated film—and the exquisitely rendered backgrounds attest to the fact that they achieved this goaland more. The other reason I adored it was because the film had a magnificent sense of humor—making a very simple story much, much more enjoyable. The animal friends (the horse and chameleon) were terrific and the film had me laughing repeatedly—particularly with its surprisingly adorable barbarian hoard (who, incidentally, remind me a lot of the Capital One commercials' Vikings). The final reason I loved the film, though it's not as prominent as the other two reasons, is the wonderful love story. The final scene of self-sacrifice by the male hero is touching—and set my tear ducts flowing.By the way, it turns out the only thing about the film I did NOT love (the similarity of the ending to that of Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"") was NOT the fault of bad writing—it's actually one of the few aspects of the that is from the original fairy tale! This tidbit comes from my amazing older daughter who is a folklore major.The bottom line—watch this film! You'll be glad you did—and it's much better than it appears to be based on the TV commercials and previews.","

"TANGLED","intelearts","9 January 2011","With jaw-dropping graphics and an abundance of heart this is simply what you would wish for in a fairy tale: memorable, magical, and magnificent.We cannot remember the last time we saw a film that was simply so entertaining - there is almost nothing to complain about here in any way and much to praise from values to comedy to several scenes that were genuinely moving - this really is one of the best movies of the year and deserves its massive box office success.If perhaps you are reluctant to see it as you think it will just rehash old Disney ideas or be unsuitable for small children I would say those are always my first concerns, but here for the first time in a very long time I can honestly say that here we have a film that holds its own integrity and so, even with the villain's death, you don't feel that it was put in to scare.All in all, a magical, hilarious, witty, and very well thought through movie that deserves the Oscar that is surely coming to it - simply the best animated movie of the year as, more even than Toy Story 3, it rises beyond animation to make a wonderful heart-filled adventure that makes for very satisfying viewing indeed.Thank you, Disney.","

"TANGLED","Blueghost","24 November 2010","A few days ago I saw ""Megamind"", and thought it was just okay. I enjoyed it for what it was, but I didn't think it too spectacular. My faith in CGI entertainment was on the wane.Well, tonight Disney pulled me from that depression, and help reinvigorate my belief in, well, just plain Disney.What we have here is Rapuntzel turned on her head, with a dash of ""Snow White"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" stirred in to keep our interest.The film was charming, clever and witty without being too much of either. The comic timing was toned down for the young kiddies in the audience, mostly little girls and some younger boys, but the comedic aspect itself did not lose luster for this. If anything it showed just what good clever comedy was. Note Rapuntzel's improvised weapon, and how she brings it to bear on the baddies in the local tavern. Classic character sketch comedy, and I don't care if I was the only one who noticed it and was laughing. You're supposed to laugh!The story itself regards fleeing the nest from a ""Mime"" like character, whose interest in our heroine is less than altruistic. The dashing rogue comes in to ground the story and keep Mandy Moore's character from running amuck and falling into despair.All in all, even though a middle aged dude like myself is no where near the target audience, I enjoyed it immensely. Some criticisms; the villainess seemed marginally cliché. She had the liberated 70s woman gone bad thing going on for her, but it almost seems like we may have seen this character before. Not sure, really. The horse was extremely likable, but his rider could have played more of a role. In fact the supporting cast almost seemed as if they were denied screen time so we could revel in Rapuntzel's golden locks. For all that, and even though the action did dive into classic Warner Brother's cartoon territory, ""Tangled"" does make a very respectable showing.That, and it was good to hear the voice of Richard Kiel play a big galoot who turns out to be a good guy. :)My final note is that there was a very good message for young girls at the end, and in fact anyone with some sense will have caught on to it. It's a message that won't last too long, but hopefully will serve as a reminder to those who paid attention. Remember, hair isn't everything. Regardless of color *wink*Take the family, but, if you're the father, then please, PLEASE, do not spend countless minutes like the idiot in front of me paying for his four member family with several credit cards while the ticket taker next to him managed to whiz through four or five parties of several members each for the 7:20 showing at the Redwood City theatre on Theatre Row.Yeah, if you're reading this, you know who you are. Stop being a putz!Everyone else, go see and enjoy the film :)","

"TANGLED","blackmambamark","28 November 2010","Honestly, when is the last time you saw a decent Disney Animated feature? No no, PIXAR does not count. I'm talking about just a regular ol' straight laced Disney flick. If your like me, I'm sure your answer falls somewhere in the mid 90's. But isn't that a shame? What happened to the totally awesome Disney movies? If your excuse is because of technology, i assure you that your wrong. You can make a great animated movie without resorting to actual hand drawn art. But where is that old feeling we all use to share? Well i can tell you this much....i already knew that Disney had something special here, mainly because the VP of PIXAR jumped ship and decided to fund this project. The first time anyone from PIXAR has ever done so, let alone the freakin VP. So needless to say, Disney finally had enough, and pulled out all the stops for this one.I kid you not when i say this....""Tangled"" is easily the best Disney Animated feature i have seen since ""Aladdin"".....yes, it is that good. They finally let go of trying to find something new and different and settled with what was working for them almost 20 years ago. It's a princess tale that easily falls into the same category with the classics. So wait, does that mean i'm comparing it to the likes of ""Snow White"" ""Cinderella"" and ""Sleeping Beauty""? You damn right i am! Sure the storyline is cliché' and relative to other Disney classics, but it felt so good to see and feel something that helped recall your childhood. But other than those minor speed bumps, the movie is spot on. The animation is spectacular, and you would be a fool not to see it in 3D. The musical sequences didn't seem forced and were never boring. And i can almost guarantee you that it will snag the best song award at the Oscars. I'm just glad that they didn't work the story around the music, which is what a lot of animated features tend to slip up on. But this one did an amazing job of hybriding them together.Bottom Line, ladies and gentleman, this is the Disney picture you have been waiting for. It will definitely win your heart and please audiences both young and old.","

"TANGLED","DarkVulcan29","13 December 2010","Flynn Ryder(voice by Zachery Levi) a charming but clumsy thief, who after a heist, and nearly escapes with his life, finds his way too a tower, that appears to be isolated, but it's not, cause an 18 year old girl named Rapunzel(voiced by Mandy Moore) with magical long hair lives there. She strikes a bargain with Flynn, Rapunzel has hidden his stolen goods, and tells him that if he takes her to see a mysterious lights in the sky, Flynn agrees to it, but the question is will they get there?The most fun animation since Shrek and Toy Story. I mean the animation just jumps out at you. And Perfect voice casting, Zachery Levi and Mandy Moore where just too perfect. So was Donna Murphy and Brad Garratt in there roles. I believe this film will be enjoyed for many years to come, by kids and adults.","

"TANGLED","leplatypus","15 January 2011","I liked so much this movie that i watched it two times on screen (my last back-to-back was ""Indi 4""): one with my nephews and the other alone but in 3D and as usual, 3D ins't the ultimate experience (Imax is better) because eyes get used quickly and the colors are darker.I was nearly tempted to name it my movie of 2010 but i prefer a movie with real people instead. Nevertheless, this Rapunzel is the best female character that Disney gives us since Princess Jasmin. To be honest, as much as it's disturbing, i found her very sexy and i wonder if her genes aren't not rated (look for a C. S.). But, looks don't make soul and her personality is as well very engaging: she dreams, she smiles and she cares! I don't know the original fairy tale but i really appreciate the lessons of rebellion and emancipation depicted here: As teens, we are torn between fear of parents and joy of disobeying and the solution is to learn how to say ""no"" to our parents. Here, those moments are showed with wisdom and talent.Finally, my niece was happy because she was lifted by this beautiful pink princess (almost a sister for her) while my nephew got bored because the movie was lacking action and fights! In a decade, i am sure he will change his opinion!","

"TANGLED","maestro-20","25 November 2010","I was apprehensive, to say the least, when I went to see Tangled, after the disappointment that was Princess and the Frog. First, Disney's back with CGI animation, which hasn't really worked that great except, maybe to some extent, Bolt. Second, the trailers made it look really slapstick -- I'm rather wary of today's animation features that try too hard to be hip and fast-paced and silly.I was pleasantly surprised. Sure, there were slapstick and broad humor sure to make little kiddos laugh. But I was surprised by the sophistication as well. The screwball comedy between the hero and heroine is very well done; adults can appreciate that. The sidekicks, in particular the Max and Pascal, are hilarious. The hero and heroine are very likable and not flat. And there's a sense of sadness/wistfulness throughout the whole show that the adults will understand.But what really is great is the animation. This is Pixar-worthy great. In fact, after a while I forgot it was CGI (which tends to be a bit stiff and crude when it comes to character animation). The human characters have that hand-drawn quality even though they're CG. In fact, they're more expressive than the hand-drawn characters in Princess and the Frog. The backgrounds are gorgeous (I can count every blade of grass). And there's an iconic scene where the kingdom rouses from darkness to light with thousands of floating lanterns -- it really is magical. It reminds me of classics such as Beauty and the Beast and Sleeping Beauty.Best of all, the movie is not just all laughs and slapstick. It has heart too. Even the minor characters such as the King and Queen -- you can feel the emotions. And the romance is believable and not cheesy.Like I said, I was very pleasantly surprised. It's something that is worthy of Pixar, and I'm glad to see Disney back on their game. While Princess and the Frog was a missed opportunity, Tangled is almost perfect.","

"TANGLED","sagei","14 January 2012","Not just in a cornball sense. Could have coined the term for this movie. Leaves you warm and fuzzy but also pleasantly surprised that an old favourite can still be so well adapted for a new audience.The silliness feels distinctly contrived. A clumsy nod to Disney tradition.The music often feels equally stilted.In stark contrast to some surprisingly polished and intricate action sequences.The romance provides heartwarming and heartwrenching moments.The cast is superb. They bring the story to life and keep it moving at a fair clip towards a wonderfully satisfying conclusion.Wish them well. Hope to see more like this. Already watched it many times and will watch it many more.Thank you.","

"TANGLED","judywalker2","24 November 2010","Disney is back with Tangled and they have finally found themselves again. First I have to say as much as I loved Tangled it made me sad and angry that Disney could not accomplish the same thing for The Princess and the Frog. Here was there one chance to showcase a Black princess and they missed the mark by a football field. Well so much for that.Back to Tangled. The animation is more than great. The characters are well drawn and thought out, especially the true villain-the old lady. Disney movies are only as good as their villains and heroines; this movie does a great job at both while also giving you a good hero. It is funny and bright, cute and sad. Everyone should spend an afternoon with Tangled. Though the music is not the ""knock your socks off"" great it is good and goes well with the plot. 10/10","

"TANGLED","dylanhook","21 August 2012","Let me start by saying that I'm an 18 year old male, and was kinda dragged into watching this by my girlfriend, who is a big fan of the Disney princess movies. I finally gave in the other day, and I've very glad that I did. The movie looked gorgeous, the animation was spot on; all while holding on to the classic Disney feel. The main characters are extremely likable. Repunzel is your typical Disney princess style character: sweet, funny, etc. Eugene, aka Flynn Rider, kinda stole the show for me, but maybe that's because I'm slightly gender biased. Nonetheless, you can't deny his wit and humor. Maximus the horse fills the role of animal sidekick perfectly; just as good as Donkey was to Shrek even though he doesn't talk. While the plot is relatively predictable, it was still quite an enjoyable movie. I didn't find myself to be bored at only of the parts, and I was laughing a lot more than I had expected to. This movie is an instant classic, and a near perfect example of what animated fairy tales should be like if they want to appeal to a wide range of viewers, not just tween girls. The ending was sweet and should leave everybody happy. I think there's enough fun in this movie for all ages, including an 18 year old guy like me.","

"TANGLED","thekyles99","5 March 2011","Omg how i moaned when the daughter wanted me to sit down and watch this with her as so i finally did and yes i will not complain again about the wonders of Disney! This was such a well put together story by the team of Nathan Greyo and Byron Howard, the same team who brought us another goody from Disney ""Bolt "" They seem to like revolving their stories about young girls who dream of being either stars or princesses. This time they take on the old fairy tale classic Rapunzel with of coarse putting their very own twist on the tale. Disney movies used to turn me off as i just couldn't get by the musical numbers that usually accompanied them however I thank the TV show 'Glee' for turning my taste patterns around, it's not such a bad thing. Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore ) has been held captive due to her long magical locks of hair, in a tower, now a teenager she spends the days trying to keep herself busy amidst her tight surroundings by dreaming of stars and playing with her only friend in life a small chameleon. When a chance and surprising visit from a fleeing thief who only scaled the tower to avoid be captured by the royal guards barges into her life changing it for all the good. A great story that had me , who slowly is becoming more and more of a fan of Disney's day by day, actually wanting more as the 80 or so mins just flew by. Attention to all dad's out there... it's not that bad just give it chance!!","

"TANGLED","neonboy619","26 November 2010","Tangled continues in Disney's animation legacy of timeless classics. Being Disney's first fairy tale outing done in CGI, it's easy to have doubts. The marketing for this film didn't really do Tangled any favors either. Originally titled Rapunzel, the name change to Tangled and the shift of focus onto the male co-star Flynn Ryder in the merchandising was done as a way to try to get more boys into the theater. Despite this faulty marketing move, Tangled is very much Rapunzel's story and Rapunzel is the star of this instant classic. Sticking very close to the roots of the original German Rapunzel fairy tale, Tangled's story is one about overprotective parental figures and the need to want to break free. Mandy Moore voices Rapunzel and sings for her. Yup, this a musical. This is a big grand musical in the classical Disney style with songs by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater. Alan Menken was the one who brought Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and Enchanted to life; to name only a few. Moore really gets to the heart of Rapunzel and truly owns the part, but the real surprise is Donna Murphy as our main villain Mother Gothel. A true hero is measured by it's main villain and Mother Gothel does not disappoint.Every great Disney classics needs supporting characters. What would Mary Poppins be with Bert and the Banks' Children. What would Belle be without the enchanted objects. Snow White is just a lost girl in the forest without those dwarfs.An amazing supporting cast of characters that include Rapunzel's color changing chameleon companion Pascal, the scene stealing horse Maximus, and the main male co-star Flynn Ride accompany Rapunzel in her quest. Pascal and Maximus are animal companions but have more in common with Meeko and Percy from Pocohantas than Sebastian and Flounder from Little Mermaid for the fact that they don't talk. While they are without speech, they are fully fleshed out characters and you know exactly what they are trying to convey with their sometimes hilarious reactions. Maximus was especially a personal favorite of mine. Zachary Levi from the TV show Chuck voices and sings for Flynn Rider and it's easy to see why Disney would choose to up sale him in the TV ads. I would have to say that he's one of the most fleshed out Disney heroes since Aladdin. Tangled is a big grand epic Disney musical done in the classic sense with the modern rendering of CGI animation. This is for sure to be seen for years and years to come and I can't wait to include Tangled in my Disney Collection. I highly recommend this one.http://neonboy619.blogspot.com","

"TANGLED","slcjared","23 October 2010","I saw the finished movie at the screening before the wrap party. The movie works on every level. The Characters, the animation, the story, the score, the romance, and it's all very cute as well (in a way Disney can apparently still pull off). The one thing that I didn't get into was the songs (Except maybe the ""Mother Knows Best"" reprise). They were a little weak melodically and you won't be singing them for weeks like I do ""Part of Your World"" every time I watch the ""Little Mermaid."" However, the songs are good enough not to bring the movie down. There are so many touching scenes in this movie and you will love all of the characters by the end and have an amazing time in the process. It is definitely worth seeing in the theater, as this is probably the prettiest computer animated movie I've seen. I just can't wait to see it in stereo!(BTW, I'm a 30 year old male who grew up with Disney. And I feel like I'm being objective when I say this movie works as a movie and not as a movie exclusively for 10 year old girls.)","

"TANGLED","jergasmic","24 November 2010","I was very sketchy walking into this movie. I didn't know what to expect, it's Disney which is promising, but it's also Disney's first CGI Disney movie that got a PG rating, so it seemed different. It was pretty hard for me to choose between 'Tangled' or 'Burlesque' but I'm glad I made the decision to watch 'Tangled'. This film has everything, for everyone, boys girls and tongue in cheek humor for adults. It's Disney's answer to Shrek, but in a classy way, that doesn't feed off of pop culture. The story of the film is simple. Rapunzel is a princess that has hair that has power to heal and keep people young, but once it's cut, it loses all power. When Rapunzel was just an infant she was kidnapped by an old woman who locked her away in a tower to keep her hair all to herself. Rapunzel grows up thinking that her kidnapper is in fact her mother, and the reason she's locked away is because her 'mother' wants to keep her safe from the hardships of the world. I'd tell you more about the movie but I don't want to ruin it. Let's just say she runs away. Very simple, fairy tale plot.I was kind of saddened that Disney has succumbed to making Princess movies using CGI, but watching this movie I realize that some scenes wouldn't have the power it had, if it were in 2D. The lantern lighting scene, for example, was amazing. It wouldn't have been the same in 2D. The music, was perfect. Enough musical number to keep Disney fans more than satisfied and not enough to where it's overkill. The songs were heartfelt and meaningful, they all served a purpose, it wasn't just a nameless song thrown into the movie. The voice acting, by Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi were amazing. I was a little sketchy about Mandy. I'm a long time fan, but I wasn't sure if she had the right voice to be a Disney Princess. She gave Rapunzel so much life, and innocence, I couldn't think of any other actress who could play her better. Zachary gave Flynn life, and humor, and made him a very likable character. However, the two characters that stole the show were Pascal, the chameleon, and Maximus, the horse. Although these supporting characters have no speaking lines, through actions and emotions, you know exactly what they want to say, and the message comes in loud and clear. This movie has enough action and comedy to keep boys happy and enough emotion, romance and drama to keep the girls happy. There are a few scenes that made me tear a little, well maybe more than a little. Some scenes have so much emotion and depth that it tugs at your heartstrings, and gives you goosebumps, especially the lantern scenes. Disney is testing the waters of their film making with this one. There were many alcohol references and even references about being drunk. There's violence, people getting stabbed, and yes, even blood. Which you never see is Disney movies. Overall, I highly recommend this movie, to everyone. Anyone could enjoy this movie. It's very hard not to like it. With theater prices so high, I suggest you don't spend 10 dollars to watch Cher and Christina, but watch 'Tangled' instead. They don't make movies like this anymore. It's much better than last year's 'Princess and the Frog'. Rapunzel is now in the line-up of classic Disney princess. I cannot stress how amazing this film is. Go out and see it.","

"TANGLED","misterembryo","29 November 2010","Rather than your ordinary Once Upon a Time, the story of Tangled starts with a voice-over from Flynn Ryder, our egotistical antihero, warning you that this is a story about how he died. This American Beauty style prologue is a clear indication that although it's a Disney movie, this story is not without the darkness of Grimm. As Disney's 50th animated feature film, Disney freaks and general moviegoers alike will be pleased to find that Tangled is worthy of the golden hallmark. It's beautifully animated, full of surprises, and really funny. I'll even go so far as to say it has the power to jerk a few tears.Disney decided to go with an alternate title instead of sticking to the original Rapunzel. It works because this imaginative retelling seems to be a little more than a story about a girl with long hair. It's also a story about an old woman consumed with a fear of dying. Her name is Gothel, and she's the figure that sets all the action in motion by kidnapping the baby princess at birth. She did this because she's aware of the magical properties that lay hidden in our heroine's golden locks: sing a special song to it, and you can live forever.Gothel hides Rapunzel away in a tower, raises her as her own, and forbids her from seeing the light of day, urging the world is an evil place. This is creepy within itself, and among all the Disney villains, Gothel is by far one of the creepiest, reminiscent of the mom in Stephen King's Carrie, from the scary way she keeps her daughter sheltered down to the scary way she is ultimately defeated.Gothel at least had the decency to provide Rapunzel with a library of books. This has kept Rapunzel occupied for all the 18 years she spent in isolation, and has made her apt at a range of activities some of us may never learn: painting, paper mache, charting stars. Still, she longs to see the world, if only to find the source of the floating lanterns: mysterious lights that fill the sky every year on the night of her birthday.Flynn Ryder's not your average knight-in-shining armor. He's more like Gaston in a Han Solo costume. Poor Flynn is in enough trouble as it is, constantly hounded down for stealing a prized possession from the royal family. Aside from the palace guards, Flynn has to deal with twin goons that resemble Jason Stathem and a tenacious police horse. Next thing you know, Flynn is stuck with a teenage girl in desperate need of rebellion.Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi provide the speaking and singing voices for our two protagonists, and do a phenomenal job. The voice acting is pitch perfect, just like the music composed by the legendary Academy Award-winning Alan Menken.I can't wait to see Rapunzel at Disneyland, not just because she's smoking hot, but also because it'll be entertaining to see eight guards following close behind to accommodate her long head of hair. The 260 million dollar budget makes this the most expensive animated feature to date. Considering the magic it will bring to households 50 more years down the road, Tangled is worth every penny.","

"TANGLED","iloveUGA123","11 January 2012","I absolutely loved this movie!! Disney originally tried making another princess movie a few years ago, Princess and the Frog. That movie was not good at all!! Disney is known for their amazing princess movies, and that was not one of them, and I have know idea what happened with that movie! Now that Disney has made this movie, they are back on top with their incredible princess movies!! The music was wonderful, and the movie was a little different from their usual princess movies. This one was funner and more modern, but they still had the whole princess feel to it, which is what Disney is known for! Disney's other movies, that don't have music, and aren't a princess movie that have been coming out over the years are good too. They just haven't made a princess movie like this one since The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, etc. I would definitely watching this movie, no matter what age! Especially if you grew up watching their princess movie, I absolutely know that you will love this movie!","

I took the grandkids today to see this movie and they loved it, as did I. The 3D is worth going to. There is enough silliness, adventure, and romance to allow boys and girls of almost all ages to love this show. There were some funny lines in the show that kids would not understand, but adults would enjoy. I heard a gentleman laughing throughout the whole show. I am not around teenagers, so I am not sure how a teenager would respond to this show. The storyline was different but predictable. That should not discourage anyone from going to this show. I would rate it as one of the best, if not the best animation show I have ever seen. This show is a winner as a family show.","

"TANGLED","SGuy157","5 January 2011","I will start off by simply saying that this movie is excellent. No, the word excellent doesn't even describe this movie well enough, because it is better than excellent. I could not take my eyes away movie for the hour and a half of the film. Even if the movie was seven hours long my eyes would still be glued to the screen for the whole time. Along with Up, this has to be the best animated movie ever made.The animation was outstanding, and I was amazed at all of the little details in all of the characters, objects, and backgrounds in every frame of every scene. The film is full of breathtaking and amazing images. The scene with all of the floating lanterns was one of the most beautiful things I have seen in a movie. Nothing could have been done to improve the amazing visuals and animation used.Before first seeing the movie, I hadn't realized that it was a musical, so that was a pleasant surprise for me. I have heard people say that the movie was great while the music was only average or not that good. I, on the other hand, thought that the music was wonderful and fit perfectly with what was happening, whether it be the action and fighting scenes or the calmer scenes like the lantern scene.Also, this movie actually made me laugh, and I don't laugh much during most animated movies. Personally, I thought that the dialogue was great and all of the characters worked well together. I especially loved the relationship with Rapunzel and Flynn, because it could be comical at one point and then touching at the next. And not only was the dialogue be used for comedy, but it also was used to create beautiful and touching scenes. Even thinking about the line were Flynn told Rapunzel she was his new dream and when she told him that he was hers gives me chills.I really hope that this movie gets an Oscar. True, Toy Story 3 and How to Train Your Dragon were both outstanding movies, but I think Tangled is the most deserving in the animated film category. Every aspect of the film was perfect. The animation, the story, and the score all were excellent and when combined they made a movie that couldn't have been better.Congratulations Disney, you've got me tangled. I wish I could see it again, but unfortunately I think I'll just have to wait until it comes out onto DVD. I hope to see more movies like this in the future.Oh, and by the way, I'm a guy. A teenage guy. So really this movie should appeal to all audiences. If you love a good movie that is charming, funny, beautiful, and touching, then go see the movie Tangled. You won't be disappointed.","

"TANGLED","valen060","6 December 2010","Before I begin the review, I must say that Disney has made quite an accomplishment in making this the 50th animated movie in their history since ""Snow White"" back in 1937! What an era that was! As for the movie, changing the title to ""Tangled"" from ""Rapunzel"" does indeed reach out well with its young audiences. The cast was well-selected, the animation was complex, yet brilliantly crafted, and the song arrangements felt traditional in terms of what the past Disney fairy tale-based films had done before, which captured my attention and kept me interested even more. After all, Mandy Moore did a stunning job providing the speaking and singing voice of Rapunzel herself. The song titled ""I See the Light"" was very noteworthy among them all since I felt a similar, positive feeling as I did with Aladdin's ""A Whole New World.""I wasn't bored in the least on the storyline, it made me want to see more as the plot began to develop even further. At one point, I couldn't help but feel sorry for the two main characters' (Flynn and Rapunzel) inner struggles and how they really feel about one another, but that's exactly what I was hoping! Growing up among Disney's most memorable canon animated films throughout its history has been something I've followed since I was born (the late 1980s). I have seen all of the previous 49 animated movies and ""Tangled"" has definitely made itself worthy to reside in its rightful place as the official #50! THIS is a must-see and I think I'll be looking forward into seeing it again and again whenever I choose!","

Then I just knew how was it gonna be... what a beautiful movie! what a great characters! As many of you I'm gonna sound repetitive but... it surely worths it... Disney's classics are back. And there's no Pixar in here... no mates, that was all Disney! What we have here is a real Disney Princess (not like that sad intend to go back in time with The Princess and The Frog), a real one. With a dream, with a lovely voice, and no boundaries! Who wants to go beyond and beyond... and what is most important... she takes us with her! I felt there inside from the very beginning until the end. And of course without adding the fact that there's unexpected parts: no one can say that the end (you know what I mean, not to spoiler you) was expected... TOTALLY AWESOME! (when I've got here in fact I felt like you all were reading my mind!!! All of us where in the same theater, in front of the same screen the whole movie).

"TANGLED","dutchs-1","22 January 2011","I'll never get this magic stuff. If you put a magic flower under a basket, won't it die from lack of light? And if you use it to save the queen in childbirth, why will the baby have magic powers? And why her hair? That's why I flunked out of Hogwarts. But what a fun film. Rapunzel is not just beautiful, she's seriously cute. And unlike the saintly Snow White and Cinderella, she's got a marvelous streak of spitfire in her. There's hilarious slapstick and barbed dialog. The villainess is classic Disney wicked stepmother, smarmy and selfish, whose physical beauty only serves to accentuate the evil within. She meets a most satisfying demise. The lighting of the lanterns, Rapunzel's whole motivation for leaving her tower, is breathtakingly beautiful. And on a technical note, this film got a writeup in Scientific American for advancing the frontiers of animation. Previously, extremely complicated motions of hair or clothing became rigid because the algorithms couldn't handle the complexity. The animators solved that problem. Also, a flood scene is the most lifelike CGI water I've ever seen. My only complaint, which made me consider giving the movie a 9, is that wicked stepmom has a couple of tedious musical numbers that the film could have omitted with no loss.","

Maximum was hilarious. A horse with a mind of his own that can do quite a number of 'stunts'.I would highly recommend this movie not only to adults but for young children as well. It's fast, exiting and very entertaining.I didn't find any parts to be 'slow going' and it certainly put a new slant on the old story of Rapunzel.A real 'feel good happy' type of movie.","

"TANGLED","cbluvsact","9 January 2011","I have seen this movie 3 times as of today, and possibly 4 as of next week, if that gives anyone a good idea of what a fantastic movie this is. Tangled is now my favorite of the 50 Disney animated movies out there, or any animated movie for that matter. Despite fans of the classic Disney princess being down on the CGI animation, I to the contrary found that this was a vast improvement. The scenery and basic concepts were still classic Disney, but the CGI made them movie vivid and realistic but in a cute animated way. The characters were all very deep, and all added their own humorous aspects to the movie. Repunzel was a bad ass without being violent, and more lovable than the rest of the princesses combined. The prince was actually a bandit role (Flynn) and way more dimensional than previous princes. He was a main part of the movie, and he added a great contrast to Repunzel's naive heroine. I left having a crush on Flynn, and wanting to go to the pet store to buy a pet chameleon. I predict that at the end of the movie you will leave feeling lighter at heart, and transported back to being a wide eyed youngster. Well, I did anyway.","

All the characters even look stock Disney except for one major difference, this movie is in 3D. And, boy what a difference that makes. Each character exhibits the entire spectrum of faces and emotions, the visuals are amazing and the use of lighting makes for some really astounding visuals.Who really steals the show is the horse Maximus. He doesn't say a word but he's funny, sympathetic, brave, noble and heroic all with just physical expressions. The other characters are equally well done. I really think this movie marks a significant achievement in Disney's animation and makes me excited about Disney movies in a long time. I highly recommend this movie to see the Disney magic done right.","

I'm not a big song guy..... but the songs in this movie are very good. Either very funny or, when the love songs begin, nicely done with some good lyrics and music. It's a '10' all the way across the board. In keeping with the Disney animators reputation for hiding phallic symbols, this has maybe the most blatant one of all. When the mother is standing near the window, her shadow is unmistakably harder than Chinese arithmetic. Keep an eye out for it..... But, this movie really is well done. The song and visuals in the tavern with all the thug characters is pretty funny. Definitely see this one!!","

Everyone simply loved it. The 3-D effects were noticeable and wonderful. We got a kick watching our 4-year-old raise his hands as if to catch some of the action float off the screen. There were tears, and much laughter, as is Disney's style. The story of Rapunzel is very well told here, with great villains, heroes and wonderfully entertaining scene-stealers, like the non-verbal horse, Maximus. The music is very theatrical and very typical of the usual Alan Menken genius (Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Little Mermaid, etc.). This movie is very entertaining for adults, and the kids will absolutely go crazy for it! Treat your family this season to a great movie! You won't be disappointed.","

They moved in to the 2000's Atlantis, Lilo and Stitch, Treasure planet, Brother Bear, Home on the Range, Bolt.Last year they had a great movie of the Princess and the Frog.And now they tried with the well-known fairytale of Rapunzel!And it worked beautifully. Disney is now going back to it's original roots of doing creative story-telling. As Walt Disney aspired and created to do. Walt Disney himself even tried to create a compelling story for the story Rapunzel but it never took off (Similar to the little mermaid)And many years later the Disney company decided to take it of the shelf and give it another go. And they succeeded.Rapunzel is a smart, artistic and Naive girl who is locked up in the tower all her her life. Always wondering when will her life Begin..... Turning 18 she dreams to see the ""Stars"" that appear every year on her birthday. But her Mother, Gothel refuses to let her go outside for Rapunzel's Safety. Stuck in the tower Rapunzel still wonders what life is like out there.But through lucky circumstances a charming thief wonders into her tower. Surprised, Rapunzel seizes this chance with him and makes a deal for him to take her to see the Stars.And so she and Pascal flies out of her tower to explore the new world around her. There are no pop culture references and is not bound to the laws of reality. (Such as people questioning about the weight of her hair....)People always compare the music to Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Little Mermaid. The music might not be as memorable. But it is still beautiful music and Alan Menken (Who did A lot of the Disney renaissance music) Did a Great job for it. It helps to set the mood.The animation is beautiful! Excellent detail, fluent movement of the characters (Maximus especially and the massive effort to do Rapunzel's Hair).The villain Mother Gothel might be just a villain but she is more complicated than any other Disney villain. In the film you can question if she loves Rapunzel as an Object or as a real daughter.Rapunzel in other hand is a great female heroin. Loving her mother so....and does what she says. But eventually explores outside of her tower and when she finds the truth she does not take it lightly. In the film she's the one calling the shots, not the male protagonist. The story was great and you can connect with the characters. (But I think the climax should have a bit more action in it) The story is Disney Generic but that's why we love it.....If Tangled is successful enough they might combat the story of ""The Snow Queen""","

"TANGLED","Hitchcoc","7 September 2017","Everyone knows the story. The girl, Rapunzel, with the golden hair, kept up in a tower. She is only visited by one person who controls her. Of course, unless she were headstrong, nothing would happen in this film. And, of course, she is. Also, we know that to fulfill her dreams a guy is going to show up. This time, however, the rules get changed a bit and the formula is broken as well. I didn't gravitate toward this one as much as previous Disney films, but it was still very good. I think the title is great. I think the plot moves along at a nice pace and Rapunzel is quite interesting. Once again, the animation is superior.","

Mother Gothel sees the flower and hides it; then she finds that when she sings to the flower, she rejuvenates. Centuries pass and a kingdom is raised in the place where the flower is hidden. When the beloved Queen is about to have a baby, she gets sick and the only hope to save her is to find the magic flower. But Mother Gothel does not want to share the sun's gift and keeps the flower hidden. However, the spot is found and the magic of the golden flower heals the Queen. When the Queen's daughter Rapunzel is born, she receives the healing power from the flower and Gothel abducts her to use her magic hair to stay young. Gothel raises Rapunzel as a daughter, without cutting her hair and locks her in a height tower in an isolated area. She keeps Rapunzel far from other people, telling that it is for her own protection. The King and the Queen celebrates the anniversary of their beloved daughter releasing lanterns to the sky, and Rapunzel dreams on leaving the tower to see the floating lights from the outside world. When the thief, cheater and liar Flynn Rider steals the crown with two bandits, he is chased by the royal guard. However, he double-crosses the other thieves and flees, and climbs the tower to hide. However, Rapunzel hits him with a frying pan and hides his satchel with the crown. Rapunzel promises to return the satchel if Flynn takes her to see the lanterns. He accepts the deal and they start a dangerous journey of discoveries and love chased by the guards, the bandits and Mother Gothel. ""Tangled"" is a delightful animation based on the fairy tale by the Grimm Brothers. The story is wonderful for children and also for adults, and I loved the sequence when Rapunzel makes peace between Eugene Fitzherbert and Max. Join your family, bring the popcorn and have a great entertainment for 100 minutes running time. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Enrolados"" (""Rolled Up"")","

"TANGLED","mattyschreck","29 January 2011","Yes, this is a ""typical"" Disney movie, with singing heroes (and heroines) and villains, saucer-size-eyed characters, cutesy animal companions, and a coming-of-age plot. However, it's also a Pixar movie (genius John Lasseter was Executive Producer) meaning that it is hilarious in most scenes, heart-stoppingly beautiful in the visuals, wittier than 95% of all the other movies out there, and definitely something that can be loved and enjoyed by both little kids and their parents. The plot really has nothing to do with Rapunzel, apart from a woman being imprisoned in a tower, who has (very) long hair. The story Disney has come up with is probably one of the most beautiful they have ever crafted. A princess is abducted by an evil witch while she is still a baby, and grows up completely sheltered by the witch, who needs her magical hair to stay young. Every year on the princess' birthday, the distraught king and queen let beautiful lanterns rise to show her the way home. Of course, the princess, now almost 18, has no idea what they mean but knows that they are important, and wants to see them from up close. A young thief who stumbles upon the tower is just the right companion for her to get out, and from there the plot develops with never-before-seen speed in a Disney movie: just like we are used from Pixar. I don't have kids, but I loved watching this movie in a cinema that was filled with them - as soon as the adorable animal companions (a horse that acts like a dog, and a chameleon very much the same as the cockroach in Wall-E) fell over, the kids were screaming with laughter. And then they would make one of those cleverly animated faces that only adults can understand, and I had to laugh. There are other scenes that will forever stick in my memory: how Rapunzel transforms a tavern full of evil ruffians into a singing mob of people who follow their dreams, how the use of a frying pan in one small scuffle becomes the weapon of choice for a whole kingdom, and more than anything else, when the lanterns are being lit and released into the night sky. I'm a 33-year-old male, but I have to say: that brought tears into my eyes, it was that beautiful and moving.I don't really understand why this movie hasn't received more attention. I used to be a very strong Disney fan until the company became weird (Pocahontas and later), but having watched Tangled, I can honestly say that this is easily the wittiest, fastest, and possibly even most beautiful Disney film I have ever seen.","

"TANGLED","petit76","28 November 2010","I was very sketchy walking into this movie. I didn't know what to expect, it's Disney which is promising, but it's also Disney's first CGI Disney movie that got a PG rating, so it seemed different. It was pretty hard for me to choose between 'Tangled' or 'Burlesque' but I'm glad I made the decision to watch 'Tangled'. This film has everything, for everyone, boys girls and tongue in cheek humor for adults. It's Disney's answer to Shrek, but in a classy way, that doesn't feed off of pop culture. The story of the film is simple. Rapunzel is a princess that has hair that has power to heal and keep people young, but once it's cut, it loses all power. When Rapunzel was just an infant she was kidnapped by an old woman who locked her away in a tower to keep her hair all to herself. Rapunzel grows up thinking that her kidnapper is in fact her mother, and the reason she's locked away is because her 'mother' wants to keep her safe from the hardships of the world. I'd tell you more about the movie but I don't want to ruin it. Let's just say she runs away. Very simple, fairy tale plot.I was kind of saddened that Disney has succumbed to making Princess movies using CGI, but watching this movie I realize that some scenes wouldn't have the power it had, if it were in 2D. The lantern lighting scene, for example, was amazing. It wouldn't have been the same in 2D. The music, was perfect. Enough musical number to keep Disney fans more than satisfied and not enough to where it's overkill. The songs were heartfelt and meaningful, they all served a purpose, it wasn't just a nameless song thrown into the movie. The voice acting, by Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi were amazing. I was a little sketchy about Mandy. I'm a long time fan, but I wasn't sure if she had the right voice to be a Disney Princess. She gave Rapunzel so much life, and innocence, I couldn't think of any other actress who could play her better. Zachary gave Flynn life, and humor, and made him a very likable character. However, the two characters that stole the show were Pascal, the chameleon, and Maximus, the horse. Although these supporting characters have no speaking lines, through actions and emotions, you know exactly what they want to say, and the message comes in loud and clear. This movie has enough action and comedy to keep boys happy and enough emotion, romance and drama to keep the girls happy. There are a few scenes that made me tear a little, well maybe more than a little. Some scenes have so much emotion and depth that it tugs at your heartstrings, and gives you goosebumps, especially the lantern scenes. Disney is testing the waters of their film making with this one. There were many alcohol references and even references about being drunk. There's violence, people getting stabbed, and yes, even blood. Which you never see is Disney movies. Overall, I highly recommend this movie, to everyone. Anyone could enjoy this movie. It's very hard not to like it. With theater prices so high, I suggest you don't spend 10 dollars to watch Cher and Christina, but watch 'Tangled' instead. They don't make movies like this anymore. It's much better than last year's 'Princess and the Frog'. Rapunzel is now in the line-up of classic Disney princess. I cannot stress how amazing this film is. Go out and see it.Evren Buyruk from USA","

"TANGLED","neil-476","4 February 2011","Tangled is advertised as Disney's 50th animated movie. In many respects, it is also the first - the first movie to tell one of the traditional fairy stories (in the way that the classic animated tales, starting with Snow White, did) using the classic type of Disney character design, but to do so using CGI and 3D.I thought this film was great. It looked like a classic Disney movie, but with the CGI lushness which today's audiences have come to expect. The slender story of Rapunzel is fleshed out nicely with additional story elements, none of which betray an audience expecting a traditional fairy story, and it races along, full of excitement, action, humour, suspense and emotion. And yet there is sufficient in the way of modern sensibilities that a 21st century audience will not feel adrift.The characters are extremely well realised. All the supporting characters are fun (particular the animal sidekicks and the den of thieves), and the three main characters are exceptionally well done. Villain Mother Gothel is splendidly duplicitous, often funny, great looking, and wonderfully voiced by Donna Murphy. Flynn Rider is a lovable rogue straight out of the textbook, but with sufficient character not to be simply a cardboard cut-out. And Rapunzel herself is beautiful, and heart-achingly human in facing the dilemma of doing what she is driven to do while facing the fact that this is a betrayal of her mother's wishes (essentially the same dilemma Ariel faced in The Little Mermaid, but realised far better - and I thought Mermaid was a nearly perfect film!).The songs are satisfactory, but Glen Slater is no Howard Ashman - the lyrics are good, but they don't sparkle.And did I mention that this film looks fabulous? Every aspect of the visuals is perfectly realised, and looks simply stunning. The 3D is ever present but not intrusive. It enhances - sometimes significantly, but not to the extent that the film is poorer for its absence.If I may get a bit spoilery, there is an element towards the end which reminded me of both Beauty And The Beast and Shrek - one of the characters displays an unexpected element of self-sacrifice and, in so doing, cuts off an escape route, following which something wonderful happens and all ends well. In each of these cases I was aware of being emotionally manipulated. But, by gum, it works! My 9-year old companion was wiping tears away, and so was I, even though I was expecting the miraculous turn-around which followed.I loved this film.","

"TANGLED","the-movie-guy","19 November 2010","(Synopsis) After receiving the healing powers from a magical flower, the baby Princess Rapunzel is kidnapped from the palace in the middle of the night by Mother Gothel. Mother Gothel knows that the flower's magical powers are now growing within the golden hair of Rapunzel, and to stay young, she must lock Rapunzel in her hidden tower. Rapunzel is now a teenager and her hair has grown to a length of 70-feet. The beautiful Rapunzel has been in the tower her entire life, and she is curious of the outside world. One day, the bandit Flynn Rider scales the tower and is taken captive by Rapunzel. Rapunzel strikes a deal with the charming thief to act as her guide to travel to the place where the floating lights come from that she has seen every year on her birthday. Rapunzel is about to have the most exciting and magnificent journey of her life.(My Comment) Tangled is the retelling of the Rapunzel fairy tale. Disney's storytelling version is fantastic and the animation was just spectacular. Rapunzel's long golden hair looks incredibly realistic, and all the characters in the movie are cute and extremely lovable. The animals involved as part of the story were given great personalities (even though they did not speak a word), and the horse Maximus stole all the scenes he was in. There are many tender and touching scenes throughout the movie. Disney's usual touch of magic makes this movie a home run. The movie has romance, humor, and action that will please a wide range of audiences. Both children and adults will enjoy this new Disney classic. (Disney Pictures, Run Time 1:40, Rated PG) (10/10)","

"TANGLED","insomniac_rod","23 May 2011","Yes, ""Tangled"" is that good. It offers great humor, funny situations, endearing characters, great musical moments, spectacular animation, and a high entertaining factor. It takes the classic fairy tales to a higher level because the central character is clever, fun, and knows how to defend herself.The Rapunzel story is re-booted according to the exigences of the new millennium. No more of a stuck up girl with zero ambitions. This girl is brave and can kick ass.I laughed out loud in many scenes. I looked in awe thanks to the 3D (the starts looked spectacular).This is the best Disney movie in years. Period. It is magical, touching, has a message, and can be enjoyed by all ages.","

It is a movie that kids should grow up seeing and believing that life really is that good. My sister loved it so much she sings it all the time and she is only 3 years old! It has become her favorite movie and I know she has learned good things from it. This is her singing to it. It can help to create a roll model for kids and can teach them about never giving up on your dreams and about how the world really can be a beautiful place even though there is still bad. here is a video of my sister singing one of the best songs from the movie. ain't she adorable? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOUQUdZrmpg","

They lost that heart, magic and soul that once made them the rulers of animation. Move to 2008 and Bolt brought a ray of hope. Then in 2009 The princess and the frog marked their return to fairy tales. Enter 2010 with Tangled a fantastic movie that has all the elements to be a classic and a great movie for years to come. The story is very simple yet the movie never loses it pace. The animation is gorgeous and the music may not be epic but is everything you can expect from Alan Menken. In overall a great movie worthy of all the attention it can get. Lets hope that Disney continues this way.","

"TANGLED","wovendesires","26 November 2010","First let me say that I am not usually the one who give reviews to movies, but this one I felt was necessary. When I went to see Disney's Tangled, I really wasn't expecting much. The previews I saw hadn't appealed to me enough, but a group of friends went to see it and I was dragged there. To put it in simple terms, it was amazing! Not only were the characters believable, but the relationships between them were as well, especially between the hero, heroine and villain. The design was very detailed and beautiful; I personally loved the scene with the lights -if you've seen it, you know what I mean. As for the score, I feel it went back to the classics like ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast""; the songs were very much like the movies when I was growing up, when Disney was the number one choice for kids. Although in my opinion, Tangled didn't manage to bring a song as memorable as key songs like ""Part of your world"" or ""Beauty and the Beast"", I can't take the ""Healing Song"" out of my mind.All in all, I believe it was a wonderful movie. It felt like Disney from the good old days. I guess it's a farewell note to all of us who grew up with Disney as they head out of the 'Princess era' and bring forth their new 'boy-oriented' movies. In all true honesty, even though I'm a 25 year old male, I am one who loves the classics, and don't find any interest in movies like the ""Mars needs Moms"" that was announced before the movie started. It's movies like these that made Disney so popular, and even though I understand why they decided to make this change, I feel that what Disney should focus on is bringing more movies like Tangled: with enough story, great characters, a pinch of heart and a general feeling of hope that makes Disney what it has always been: a place for kids to hope and dream.","

"TANGLED","benladams","16 November 2010","About two minutes into the 3D version of this film, I turned to my friend and said, ""this is AMAZING."" And it really is. The depth of color and the quality of the details are simply stunning. But the beauty of the animation wasn't the only good thing about the movie, just the most obvious. The storytelling was fantastic and fast-paced, weaving an age- old fairytale with a modern reinterpretation of surrounding events. What really makes the film, as far as the characters go, though, is the personalities that Disney assigns to the animals involved. None of these animals ever utters a word, yet they easily steal the show with their clear human emotions and comedic timing. This is definitely a film I recommend, even if you don't have children.","

"TANGLED","Jerique","28 December 2010","In the last few days of 2010, I got to see one more final movie and seal the deal on what I think is the best year of movies in over a decade. It was Tangled! I'd see the trailer of the re-imaging of this particular fairytale and thought it'd be cute with the comedic ""she's been grounded...like... forever."" I was also drawn to Tangled for the reason of being a big Mandy Moore fan. However, I did not expect it to be a musical nor to have Alan Menken (a top favourite composer of mine) to be the film's composer.Beyond being a great score with a few catchy tunes, I did find myself getting annoyed whenever Rapunzel (Moore) would break into song. It was great at first and Donna Murphy's ""Mother Knows Best"" song was great too. But after that, I was kinda hoping for just a regular movie. It was timed great and the animation worked really well to create the horse Maximus and the chameleon Pascal into comedic roles without speaking.Throughout the entire film, there was not one point where I was disappointed in it or felt that it was awful. I thought the rating of the film was perfect because although it's a kid's film, some of the romance is more aimed for teens and an older audience than a six year old. It's a great film for the year and I think it's one of the best animated films ever to be created. I highly recommend this one.","

"TANGLED","mmmincr","27 November 2010","Ever since I saw the previews for this movie, I've been dying to see it. But after having viewed it, it far exceeded my expectations! The characters were completely lovable, especially the chameleon (Pascal) and horse (Maximus), they provided laughs throughout the whole movie, the evil characters were also developed very well. The animation was breathtaking, especially of Rapunzel's hair as well as the lanterns released into the sky (It was absolutely gorgeous!!). I have read other reviews saying that the songs were not so great, but I found them very entertaining. In this movie, the songs do not take such a huge role as in other Disney movies, but they are nevertheless very catchy and well done (I still have them stuck in my head). I would recommend this movie to everyone (all ages), I was in the theater with toddlers who were entertained the whole time, and I even brought along my mom who is in her 50's and she loved it! There is never a dull moment, and you'll find yourself laughing the whole 90 minutes. The romance of Flynn and Rapunzel seems utterly real, due to the wonderful animation and the talented voice actors. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the fact that I can't have a cute little chameleon like Pascal for myself!","

"TANGLED","gonewithscarlett","25 November 2010","I saw Tangled yesterday in 3D, and let me just say, I'm glad I did. When I entered the theater and saw a HUGE line, I immediately noticed that every person in the line was under the age of nine. Now, while I was a little embarrassed, I was still too excited to see the movie to care that much. Tangled's heroine, Rapunzel, is a typical Disney princess. When I say that, I don't mean like Cinderella or Snow White, waiting for her prince to come and get her. I mean like Ariel, Belle, or Jasmine. She's curious about the world, headstrong, passionate, beautiful, and, of course, sweet and kind. Oh, and she's a girl that knows what she wants--to see a spectacular light show in person. But Rapunzel is stuck up in her tower with her mother, Gothel. Now, as the movie shows us, Rapunzel doesn't mind the tower all that much. She really loves Gothel, and she's kind of scared of the world outside. All she wants to do is see thousands of lanterns lit and launched into the sky, which she watches from her window every year on her birthday. This seems like a pretty reasonable request to me. But Gothel doesn't want her daughter to leave the tower for her own selfish, vain reasons (that you have to watch the movie to find out about). So poor, lonely Rapunzel seems doomed to spend the rest of her life trapped in a tower, watching and waiting for someone to come along and save her. And someone does come along! The swashbuckling thief, Flynn Rider, steals a crown and runs for cover before the palace guards can arrest him. He just happens to end up in the secluded spot of the forest that Rapunzel's tower is in. He gets one glance of her hair, then is knocked out with a frying pan and shoved in a closet. After coming to, Rapunzel bargains with her prisoner. She'll give him back the crown if he guides her to the lanterns, then takes her home. Flynn agrees. The music in this film isn't quite up to par with Disney's best (Circle of Life, Part of Your World, etc.), but since it was written by Alan Menken, it's definitely good enough to get into your head--and stay there. The song ""When Will My Life Begin"", sung by Mandy Moore as Rapunzel, is my personal favorite. The pop/country style is modern but fits the story, and the tune is catchy. The other songs are ""Mother Knows Best"", ""I've Got a Dream"", and ""I See the Light"". While Rapunzel and Flynn Rider are great characters, I have to say that a certain Maximus the horse stole the show for me. The speechless character's facial expressions and quirky mannerisms are hilarious. He seems to hate Flynn, but he later proves how lovable and loyal he really is. Pasqual the chameleon also provides some comic relief, but the one to look for is a short, drunk old man wearing only a diaper and wings. He has very limited screen time, but he always says something hilarious. I saw this film in 3D, which, although beautiful, probably wasn't a very different experience than it was in 2D, except for one scene towards the end, when Rapunzel and Flynn are surrounded by thousands of glowing lanterns. It was breathtaking. I rate Tangled a 9.5/10. It's creative, visually astounding, and possesses that Walt Disney magic that is so hard to find lately. But don't just take my word for it. Spend the money—you won't regret it. P.S. I originally wrote this review on my new blog (througharabbithole.blogspot.com), so I'd love if you'd check it out! This is my only post so far, but more will come.","

"TANGLED","pat_nasi_buzz","12 January 2012","Taking place in a land far, far away, Tangled tells us about an evil witch named Gothel. By consuming a special flower, she was able to live forever. One day, the queen who ruled that land couldn't give birth, so she needed a special flower in order to have a baby. The king ordered his servants to trace the location of the flower, and gave it to his wife. In short, the baby was successfully born, but Gothel got angry and decided to take revenge, so she kidnapped the baby, aiming for her magic hair which she could use for eternal life. Rapunzel, the baby, grew up with her fake mother's (Gothel) lies, telling her that outside the tower was full of dangerous things. There was a handsome thief who managed to steal the Princess' tiara. He hid in Rapunzel's tower and then they met for the very first time. Mother Gothel tried to separate them but she failed. And the two of them finally saw the floating lantern, which was her biggest dream ever.Rapunzel is in an active yet wishy-washy girl, but she has a good heart. The thief, Flynn, is a handsome, playboy, and attractive guy. Mother Gothel is an antagonist. She loves Rapunzel, but is too obsessed with her hair.At first Rapunzel and Flynn didn't a smooth conversation and they didn't trust each other. As time went by, they fell in love. The conversations encourage for the viewers to support their dreams.The moral of this story is if we a have a dream, we have to make an effort and attempt to achieve it and never give up.Despite knowing the fact that it's a movie with an happy ending, we still watched it and we enjoyed it because of the excellent animation, good songs, and last but not least, because of Rapunzel herself is very entertaining; the long hair itself attracts us.","

"TANGLED","Whowantsliquor","17 November 2010","I had the pleasure of seeing an advanced screening of the movie back in October, and I was not at all disappointed in any way! Don't let the trailers and marketing fool you; this movie is anything but a Shrek rip-off like the trailers would lead you to believe. The movie is a straight-up classic animated musical along the league of The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and Beauty and the Beast. Not only does the film stick close to the original Rapunzel fairy tale, it also improves upon it by adding the Disney magic we all know and love, and that's gorgeous art, music and heart (and perhaps some twists in order to make the movie family-appropriate, as we wouldn't want an out-of-wedlock pregnant Disney heroine).The villain in the movie (Mother Gothel) is a very devious and selfish being, and perhaps the most complex Disney villain next to Frollo. In all, I love her and I think she is very unique! The protagonist, Rapunzel, is a very welcoming addition to the Disney princesses we all know and love. Her best friend, the chameleon Pascal, is hilarious and adorable! Flynn Rider is a smug guy, but charming nonetheless. The horse Maximus steals the show in most of the scenes he's in. In all, the characters in this movie are all extremely lovable! Not to mention the amazing story, visuals, and plot. If anything, this movie would be the one that starts off the new Disney Renaissance, and I'm saying that as someone who watched and loved both Bolt and The Princess and the Frog. I'm a teenager who grew up on classic Disney movies and this film definitely deserves to be one of the five best animated Disney movies ever made!","

Viewing some trailers for tangled it looked like it was going to be a funny film but was the trailers packet with the best bits? With a big smile on my face I can honestly say read on :)When the screening started 3D glasses at the ready for us all, the Sony dog I think is great and hoped that Tangled would be more like this where you could reach out and grab things, fingers crossedFrom the start I was hooked and from the absolute silence in the cinema it seemed everyone else was too. For the next hour and a half I was taken on a none stop roller coaster that just kept getting better. The 3D was amazing and at one point my son really did reach out to grab something out of the film . The story is fantastic with every character capturing your imagination and throwing you into the film wondering what's coming next . A Disney film wouldn't be a Disney film without a bit of singing and dancing and this film has just the right amount , this coupled with the already great story leaves me to think it will become one of the Disney classics it really was brilliant.I would recommend going seeing this, it put a smile on my face and my son loved it, its one of the best films I've seen for ages that we could all sit and watch together.Review by The Local Explorer","

The voicing was very good. It has an awesome story and a unique retelling of a classic tale. The film also had a very bright and colorful look, enhancing the feel-good vibe. The floating lanterns scene was simply awesome and mesmerizing, actually. Absolutely beautiful!I enjoyed every single character in the film. I felt the king and queen's sadness, still looking for their lost child years after she was kidnapped. There were some sincere, emotional moments. The horse, Maximus, was my favorite character, and I simply adored the chameleon, too! I want a horse like Maximus! I literally loved every minute of this film.The original songs were incredible, with clever, appropriate lyrics. ""Skip the drama, stay with Mama."" Ha-ha, so funny!! The only issue with the film was the inconsistency of the length of Rapunzel's hair, but I'll forgive them for the sake of convenience for the character to move about more easily.

However, just like many other films (unless it's outright lame and boring), I gave it a benefit of doubt by watching a second time and somehow my impression of the movie improved. And after watching it for the third and fourth time, I realized that I had actually missed out so much on what this movie has to offer.On the surface, it may look like another fairytale with a twist in it. But open your hearts and put yourselves in the shoes of the characters, and you'll see a whole new perspective.Plot: A beautiful story of a going-to-be-18-year-old bright and cheerful girl (just like the sun), who has never met a soul and has never been out of the tower before, and yet still dreams and hopes that she could someday realize her dreams while watching the lanterns in the sky on her birthday every year. 10/10 Characters: Rapunzel and Eugene are a perfect match and Pascal and Maximus are also their unbelievably compatible 'sidekicks'. 9/10 Visual: It is recommended to watch this in as high definition as possible and if you can watch it in 3D, please do so. Best part (and probably highlight of the whole movie): the scene where the lanterns were released and both Rapunzel and Eugene(Rider) are in the boat. 10/10 A movie not to be missed no matter what age (unless you hate fairy tales).","

"TANGLED","eschetic-2","28 December 2010","A few years ago the technical wizardry of SHREK trumped the superior story telling of MONSTERS, INC. at the Oscars, and this may be one of those years. Early buzz has the wistful mixed bag TOY STORY 3 with a lock with Oscar voters who long for their lost childhood despite the monstrous children they show in that film, but the FAR more enjoyable experience, while still not without flaws of pacing, is Disney's deliriously enjoyable semi-musical (wonderful even if surprisingly unobtrusive score by Alan Menken) rethinking of the old Rapunzel legend, TANGLED.The funny and yes, actually sexy animated leading man and his innocent but capable leading lady anchor a near perfect animated cast. The cavalry horse Maximus who starts as the hero's chief nemesis and winds up his best ally is a brilliant comic creation nearly matched by Rapunzel's faux ""mother,"" a 21st century version of the classic wicked witch. While some of the most popular recent animated features have generated major and minor sequels, this is the first animated film in my experience where I'd love to see these animated characters AS DRAWN and VOICED reused in other, not necessarily related properties as if they were real actors. They're so much fun to spend time with, you want to spend more. If Disney had the good sense to try an animated version of George Bernard Shaw's perennial success ARMS AND THE MAN with the same animated cast they've already developed, I'd be willing to bet it would be just as big a hit.Great cast, but also a great story told with amazing freshness and insouciance. By elaborating on the well known story of the maid in the tower to create a classic quest to center their refurbished story around, the film makers also opened the door to a dazzling array of fresh comic touches (I'm with Flynn - ""I gotta get me one of these!"" - in loving the possibilities of the rediscovered old kitchen and comic standby, the cast iron skillet) and amusingly twisted sub-characters (yes, even one momentarily covered with the comic rodents that have been a Disney good luck talisman for years) with ""dreams"" similar to but different from Rapunzel's and thus touched on something universal in all of us. We all have dreams that seem unrealistic, but with determination and faith may not be. TANGLED has its heart firmly in the right place as pure entertainment so that it's only afterward that we realize how strongly it was encouraging us in the audience to follow our own dreams, but the joy and the beauty that washes over us while watching it remains with us to inspire long after the credits (which, sad to relate, are the one unimaginatively filmed part of the movie and easily missed) roll.Of course the more and more ubiquitous new 3D system works beautifully and makes the motion picture experience more than it will inevitably be on the small screen, but the story telling is so good, that when the DVD inevitably comes out, it is one which will have to be on my shelves for regular reviewing whether or not we have 3D technology on our home screens yet.When the ""previews"" are as good as TANGLED's, you usually think they must have pulled ALL the best parts, but this is one case where a film lives up to it's hype. It really is one of the few ""must sees"" of a pretty good year at the movies. (Sadly, as of January 25, 2011, it appears my prognostication re. TOY STORY 3 was prescient: the Academy chose to only nominate THREE animated films - including the inferior ""How To Train Your Dragon"" as ""Best..."" - in the apparent fear that TANGLED might actually beat TOY STORY 3 as it has at the box office. Inexcusable.)","

"TANGLED","zkonedog","4 March 2017","The hallmark of Disney animated films (at least of late) has always been their ability to combine humor with heart to produce an entrancing concoction of family entertainment. Simply put, ""Tangled"" succeeds once again in that vein.For a basic plot summary, ""Tangled"" tells the basic story of Rapunzel...but with a more modern feel to it. Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) lives in a tower with Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) and forbidden to leave. One day, however, the dashing young Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) happens upon the castle and changes Rapunzel's life forever.Humor-wise, this flick will have young and old alike laughing out loud. Since it is told from the modern perspective (e.g. Rapunzel acts like a current teenager, nothing is ""stuffy"" about the tale, etc.), there is plenty of room for conversational humor and sight gags galore.Also, a very interesting animation choice produces big results: the decision to make the characters' faces/eyes as wide/expressive as possible. The film is already a visual treat (Blu-Ray highly recommended), but the emotion (and this movie is full of it) strikes a real chord in large part because of those facial features.Overall, I very much enjoyed ""Tangled"" and would highly recommend it to fans of similar Disney or other animated fare. For years I skipped this effort because I thought it little more than a ""girls movie"", but when watching it with my younger sister it was ME getting emotional...not her!","

"TANGLED","aaronjbong","29 November 2010","The Disney Renaissance period was grand to the Disney company. They had made many 2D animated musicals that had turned into all-time classics such as ""The Lion King"" or ""Tarzan"" which are based on stories, legends or maybe fairy tales. But, after 1999, things changed as the movies are no longer based on fairy takes or other stories but rather original ideas. But, 2010 will see the return of animated musicals with ""Tangled"" with the addition of 3D animation and 3D format.""Tangled"" marks the return of animated musicals and will be based on the fairytale of Rapunzel. But, Disney added some changes and new characters and also removing some things from the original tale into a new tale. It's basically about Rapunzel, a girl who has incredibly long hair with magic powers. When she's still a baby, Mother Gothel kidnapped her forth magic powers and so, Gothel took care of Rapunzel and concealed the truth that Rapunzel's parents were actually the king and queen of the empire.Unexpectedly, Flynn Rider, a mastermind thief now known as a fugitive was on the run and saw Rapunzel's tower, he climbed up the tower and met Rapunzel. Then, they began to form a relationship and so it becomes a problem for Mother Gothel then, they have fights and so on.""Tangled"" is actually a great film to begin with. It is enjoyable mostly to girls but it also has an appeal to boys. Jokes here are plenty and everything was really good. The voice performances were also magnificent. The songs in this film are classical. They are really enjoyable for kids and are memorable . There are many songs here but the division of the songs is quite uneven having Rapunzel owning over 65% of all the songs. The 3D effects if the film was also satisfying enough. It was quite in depth and the lanterns part in the film was really breathtaking. I was happy enough with the 3D effect. However, there is a prominent difference from previous animated films which is the length . Mostly range from just 80 minutes to 100 minutes. But, ""Tangled"" is actually 110 minters ling instead, very long for a children's movie. ""Tangled"" is actually a very good film. I would recommend it to everyone and their kids because this movie is truly remarkable. Even though not Disney's best movie, ""Tangled"" is definitely worth seeing it.Prince AJB's Rating: 90%Thanks for reading my review on ""Tangled"". Hope it's useful!","

"TANGLED","hellraiser7","20 May 2014","It has been far too long since we seen another animated fantasy film that Disney is best known for. As a person that has watched these kinds of films since childhood my patience was seriously getting tested. This is one of my favorite animated films because it really helped bring back the old Disney films I knew and loved.The animation is just superb, you can tell the animators were just at their A game, and the effort shows. From the background really capturing a sort of post medieval pre Renaissance era, as well as just the look of the forests and everything in it. However what impresses me the most is the character animation.The songs are hit or miss, that's what you get for most musicals. The one song that stands out for me and I feel is the most memorable is ""At last I see the Light"" which is just beautiful, it is a song of course about the romance between both Flynn and Rapunzel but also about discovering your dreams.However it's the story and characters I really love the best. Supporting character Maxamus is great, he's sort of like Duddley Do Right's horse. Like in that cartoon the horse seems to be doing a better job at exercising authority than Duddley. And I really like the buddy dynamic between both Flynn and Maxamus, there is always something really fun and touching about seeing two characters on different sides of the fence working together and bonding, we see both of them giving each other grief but also getting along and both do come though and work together.Rapunzel is great (voiced by underrated actress Mandy Moore)she's beautiful inside and out, sweet, funny, has just great charisma, energetic, and ambitious. I just love how much of a free spirit she truly is, despite being locked up in a tower most of her life her spirit will always be free. And she is a bit reluctant at times which is normal, but I like that she does go on and becomes more confidant in her actions which is something I can emphasize with. And also she's she is able to hold her own against danger.It's interesting just seeing her use non cleche items, from a frying pan which surprisingly becomes useful as a weapon though out the whole film, hey there's no weapon store/pawn shop nearby to buy a sword so it makes sense. But I really love how she uses her hair which is just amazing, you would think anyone with overlong hair would have trouble walking. But here Rapunzel we see her use to it and it's interesting seeing how well she managed maneuvering without any trouble. Her hair is indeed very useful, from acting as a lasso but most importantly she has a magical ability which is her hair is able to glow not just to light the way in the dark, but to heal fatal wounds.I even like how she seems to have this blissful affect on most people, like in that scene with the Vikings in the bar, it was kinda funny how her charm got them to reveal themselves for not being just stereotypical brute but people with dreams and needs like ourselves. But she's a character also a character that you do feel sympathy for, from the back story which is pretty sad, she's practically been a slave/prisoner most of her life unknowingly; so years of Rapunzel's life have been stolen from her let alone time with her real parents. It's just not right, that all the more gives us reason why we want Rapunzel to win, she's was meant to live free and meant to have real love in her life.But of course my favorite character is Flynn Rider (played well by Zachary Levi) he sort of reminds me The Prince of Theves character from the TV show ""Hercules the Legendary Journeys"" like that character he's a real con man whom is pretty much looking out for number one and trying to get rich quick. Is a bit shallow since he has a bit of narcissism but in a harmless sense. This is the kind of guy whom would probably be one of the last choices to save the princess but he had the luck of the draw, and hey not all heroes are perfects but sometimes to me their the best kind. He's got great charisma which is fun, clever and funny, just has some of the best lines in the film.I also like you even feel a slight sense of sympathy for him, because Flynn isn't entirely all cheerful he's been alone most of his life so he's kinda lonely; but worst of all he has no real dreams because he doesn't really know what he wants in his life let alone what he was looking for; despite how many things he stole he still has nothing. But that's because he's been looking for the wrong thing.I love the chemistry between both Rapunzel and Flynn, it's funny how both of them give each other grief. But then both of them after a long while open up to one another and warm up to each other. I like how both of them bring out something inside each other they never felt before, for Rapunzel it's a sense of adventure and freedom but for Flynn it's unselfishness and warmth. Both are right for each other you know Rapunzel's place isn't in the tower but with Flynn and Flynn has finally found what he was looking for.If the film has a message it's about not being afraid to make you dreams come true, do everything in your power or what is necessary to make it possible. But most importantly to never stop dreaming and pursuing them.Just like Rapunzel hair this film glows.Rating: 4 stars","

"TANGLED","preppy-3","30 December 2010","Disney takes the tale of Repunzel and makes a few changes. Repunzel (voice of Mandy Moore) is taken away from her royal parents at an early age. She was kidnapped by Mother Gothel (voice of Donna Murphy) because Rapunzel's long golden hair helped keep her young (it's complicated but the movie explains it). She keeps Rapunzel in a tower warning her to NEVER go outside. Then robber Flynn Ryder (voice of Zachery Levi) gets into the tower and gets Rapunzel out. Then a series of fantastic (but fun) adventures take place.First off I should mention I saw this in 2-D NOT 3-D (I refuse to pay $15.50 for an animated feature). Still I LOVED it. It's Disney's first (I think) GCI feature and it works beautifully. The characters look real and the settings are incredible. It's like one of the best Pixar features. The script is fast and funny with jokes that mange to appeal to the kids AND adults equally. The voices match the characters expertly and I got a BIG kick out of Flynn Ryder (obviously modeled after Errol Flynn). There are also two CGI animals--Pascal (a chameleon) and Maximus (a horse)--that are hysterical! They don't talk but their facial expressions alone had me laughing out loud! It IS PG for some (very mild) violence but I don't think it would bother the kids. The little girl sitting behind me couldn't have been more than 6 and it didn't bother her at all! It was fast, funny and full of adventure and humor! I was never bored for one second. A 10 all the way!!!","

The movie rolls with enough action and activity to keep the kids on their toes, and to keep their eyes on the screen the whole time.The 3.5 year old never once asked to go home in the middle of the movie, as she has for other movies. That may be her growing up a little, but a lot of it was the superb pacing of the movie.","

And, not to mention, the animation was absolutely stunning! I watched this film three times - once in 3D - and if you want visual brilliance, please see it in 3D.The animation - incredible.

"TANGLED","zactac","12 October 2011","While some may not be familiar with the name ""Disney Renaissance"", it was a sort of Disney Golden Age starting with The Little Mermaid in 1989 and ending with Tarzan in 1999. The last ten years has mostly been nothing short of the type of animation you would find on Disney Channel or Toon Disney (now DisneyXD). Disney, for some strange reason, had lost it's creative ability but now these last few years has set the pace for Disney's redemption. Pixar is what has saved Disney's film industry but now thanks to the new Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter, who also worked closely on many Pixar movies, Disney is finding themselves making movies that in a few years time will rival Pixar. Now The Princess and the Frog began this new Renaissance Era and it seems to continue with Tangled.Now this is also a different rendition of the classic fairy-tale. In Tangled Rapunzel is kidnapped as a baby and hidden in this tower by an evil woman. Her hair actually has some kind of special power that makes her so coveted. Now Rapunzel is growing up and doesn't want to stay in the tower any more. When a thief hides in the tower she knocks him out and hides his prize. She makes him promise to take her out of the tower for a day and then she'll give him back what he wants. Of course something will happen between the two and there is always this climatic battle between good and evil. But I was surprised at how much I liked it. I found the characters real and charming. The songs were definitely catchy and I can still hear them in my head to this day.There has been much controversy over how the film was made. At first I was skeptical about leaving behind the use of animated drawing but the use of computer animation was maybe the better idea. They make the animation come to life and it pulls you into the movie and that's without the story or characters.Now as for the story that was, once again, another controversy proved to be a good idea. The filmmakers take the story to new heights and even asks questions only a Pixar film would dare to ask using animation. Mandy Moore (Rapunzel) and Zachary Levi (Flynn Rider) are perfect as the leading characters. They bring humor as well as wit to roles in the most unexpected ways.Tangled isn't just another animated fairy-tale, it is a statement that Disney is back on there long-awaited top form. The title might be Tangled but Disney's return is as straight-forward as it gets. They've made their statement ""we're back and that is that."" And I can't wait to see what else they bring to the table.","

Although these supporting characters have no speaking lines, through actions and emotions, you know exactly what they want to say, and the message comes in loud and clear. Music was great and the animation was so good and it was like everything was in place properly. This movie got everything what one should expect. For me 10 on 10. Worth your money folks.

"TANGLED","dvc5159","10 December 2010","I was quite skeptical of this because I thought the Golden Year of CG- Animated films ended with a not-so-big-bang with the decent ""Megamind"". After a year which brought you ""How To Train Your Dragon"", ""Toy Story 3"", ""Despicable Me"", and ""Legend Of The Guardians: The Owls Of Ga'Hoole"", can there really be any other CG-Animated films of that caliber?""Tangled"" miraculously continues and ends that streak (at least for this year alone) with a big bang.There is nothing wrong with liking a movie which is out of your personal tastes. Yes, ""Tangled"" may look like a typical kids film on the poster, but I am glad to say that this film is a strong return to form for Disney Animation Studios.Even if it is CGI and even though the film bases itself around another fairy-tale princess, it is done very well. It is made clear that everyone involved in the film cared about the material and wanted it to reach out to everyone. They succeeded brilliantly. Everything that you loved in an animated Disney film is here in full force. Disney has never been this good since the 90's. Pixar is excluded - they're in a world of their own.Take for example, the characters and actors. Rapunzel looks cute and adorable, Flynn looks handsome and dashing; and the villains look menacing. Yet, underneath it all, the voice actors bring out the dimensions in the characters. A very versatile Mandy Moore makes Rapunzel a sweet and innocent girl yet one who is full of adventure and determination. Flynn, voiced by ""Chuck""'s own Zachary Levi, shows dry wit and vanity at times, and also self-actualization later on in the film. The other voice actors do their part just fine, especially Donna Murphy as Mother Gothel - a selfish and cruel new addition to the Disney villain club.While the story/screenplay was written well for what it's worth, the music by Alan Menken truly displays his signature Disney trademarks, the grand music, the catchy songs, the emotional ballads in the middle. I'm not surprised if it gets an Oscar nomination at the very least, knowing Oscar.Well, there, I've said it. I really enjoyed ""Tangled"", its extremely like-able main characters and it's fantastic visuals enveloping a classic fairy tale, it is a real welcome return to form for Disney, and I really hope it continues to go down this way. This one is a definite must watch for the families, a new ""Princess"" classic for Disney.Overall rating: 75/100","

"TANGLED","TaylorYee94","15 October 2020","Disney is known for a good-hearted, beautiful, and gracious princess rescued by the prince at vital moment. While it was prince helping and leading the princess out of the danger in the past Disney, Rapunzel and Flynn Ryder support each other and walk together into the adventure.In previous Disney, the prince could not catch up with princess' charms maybe because the story focuses on princess' narratives and the audience gets to hear her side of story throughout the movie. However, In 'Tangled', Flynn Rider is one good-looking lad with nice smolder, soft voice, and love for Rapunzel. This movie provides the backstory of Flynn so the audience can form the bond with him. They are most compatible, full-of-chemistry, and sparkling couple among all princess and prince.Moreover, 'I See the Light' is the most underrated disney song. Lyrics, melody, a beautiful settings with floating lights, looks on their faces.. everything is just perfect. Finally, I want to point out the setting. Corona is the most colorful and warmest place, and the lighting is the critical factor of all.","

First of all, I'd like to state that it looks amazing from the gorgeous colours to the well textured hair. The hair was one of the animaters' finest achievements in this movie, because that's one of the hard things to do in animation.The songs were okay, I See The Light was the stand-out while the others were well performed and served their purpose even if they weren't among my picks for the best songs by Alan Menken.The comedy was actually my favorite part, because there are so many hilarious passages in here, and they weren't mostly the spoken jokes, because hands down Maximus is the funniest character from Disney in a long time, maybe since the 90's!So to sum it up, a fresh take on the well known fairy-tale princess formula with stunning animation and lots of fun for the whole family are guaranteed.","

My six year old sisters love the movie, but me and my twenty year old friends absolutely adore it. Tangled is the perfect blend of modern movies and the old princess features that we all know and love. It has something to offer to everyone. The care that went into making this movie is also greatly appreciated. The trailer threw me off at first, and I still believe that the trailer was Disney's biggest mistake. In the effort to appeal to younger audiences, it made the film look cheap and thrown together. I assure you, this is not the case.

"TANGLED","cjd-16","24 November 2010","Despite the modern-sounding title, ""Tangled"" is perhaps the most classical-styled Disney film since the days of Disney himself.What really makes this movie feel like a classic is that it digs back, way back, all the way back to Disney's roots, back in the days where the most common main character that you saw in every Disney movie was along the lines of ""A completely innocent main character discovers the world."" I'm talking Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, and Bambi. And now we can add Rapunzel to this list, because this is what Tangled is really about: Rapunzel finally stepping out of her tower after 18 years of experiencing absolutely nothing but her little room at the top, and seeing the whole world in wide-eyed wonderment. To some degree, this makes Tangled feel even more ""Disney"" than even the stellar films of the 90's Disney Renaissance. We fall in love with Rapunzel right from the beginning because we want her, such a kind and loving character, to live her dreams and find beauty in this new world she is experiencing. This aspect of the film is absolutely brilliant. Rapunzel is almost like Snow White in her kindness, and yet she also actually has a real personality! I can't say enough about Rapunzel's character. She is easily near the top of all Disney princesses, mixing the love and kindness of Snow White with the realism and believability of Ariel and Belle.From a visual standpoint, this is definitely a throwback to the classics as well. The colors are vibrant and lively, and the buildings warm, rounded, cozy, and inviting, as if they themselves have been custom-chosen to convey the sense of wonderment that Rapunzel feels, like she is a child visiting Fantasyland at Disney World for the first time. This adds greatly to the tone of the film, and combines to make the whole world of this movie feel lush, romantic, and inviting. Because of this, the whole thing is a joy to watch even in its imperfect moments. There are some especially amazing scenes, most notably the floating-lanterns scene where the whole kingdom slowly lights up little by little until the whole thing looks like it is glowing from the inside. (It will no doubt be remembered as the ""iconic"" scene from this movie, like the ballroom scene from Beauty and the Beast.) Pretty much, nothing about this movie is ""negative."" It has very strong main characters with some really well-done complex relationships amongst themselves, great sidekicks, some good-natured humor, a great classical song-filled musical score that has had me humming it for the last two days, and the plot is staged without a single thing feeling boring or clichéd. And in that manner, I believe that this is the first Disney film in nearly 15 years that can truly be called a Disney classic.On the film-geek side of it, there is some amazing technical wizardry going on here. This is the best CGI hair ever put on film thus far. For the first time, we have computer-generated hair that can truly be called ""beautiful."" It shines, it stretches, and has weight that just looks right. Plus just getting the world itself to look warm and inviting is a huge accomplishment, as CGI is generally much more inclined toward producing hard mechanical edges. Great stuff! IMO, this is the biggest step forward in animation since ""Tarzan"" introduced deep-canvas technology.One other thing that makes this movie just like the best Disney classics is that it works on all levels. For the adults like us, there is some great thematic subtlety going on beneath the surface, touching on classic coming-of-age themes, mother-daughter relationships, and in Flynn's case, how often the over-confident ruffian is really just hiding personal shortcomings and really doesn't know what he wants. Plus the characters really feel like real people, and never just archetypes or caricatures. And for the kids, there is some really good-natured humor that doesn't talk down to them, a great romance story, and the film was near-perfectly-paced, with not a moment of the running-time wasted, and yet still taking time to breathe to let us see some of the acting ""ticks"" that really let us get into the heads of the characters.The only reason I am giving this a 9 is because of some minor contrivance nitpicks that keep this film just below my favorite Disney movies. The only one that I feel is really worth mentioning is the excessive use of cartoon physics. Flynn and Maximus fall off a 100-ft cliff and emerge completely unscathed. Flynn is catapulted from a wheelbarrow over 50 feet through the air and lands perfectly on a horse. And that horse then jumps over 30 feet off of a rooftop and keeps running unphased. That bugged me, and made it feel slightly like this film was taking place in a cartoon universe rather than the real world like most Disney movies, taking away slightly from its credibility. Also, there was something that kept it from feeling as ""complete"" and ""epic"" as almost every Disney movie feels, but I can't quite put my finger on why. But ultimately, these things were all minor in the grand scope of things. This was really a character-driven movie rather than external-plot-driven, and the characters are absolutely amazing.So in one department, I felt that this was as much a classic Disney movie as any ever made, and near-perfect. Due to some slight contrivances, I feel like the physical plot was a step below Disney's best, but in general I feel like Tangled is the first Disney movie in over 15 years that can truly be called a masterpiece. I actively loved almost every second of it, and immediately wanted to go back and see it again. In a world populated by movies that are either too silly or too serious, ""Tangled"" is a bright ray of sunshine that is a joy to watch at every second.","

This movie was phenomenal on every level. The characters were amazing and Zachery Levi as well as Mandy Moore voiced the characters fantastically. They seemed very human and the animation was awesome. I went to watch a few other movies that day as well and this is the one movie that stuck out the most. It made me happy and is a great pick me up. The only criticism would be the musical numbers. They could have been worked on a little more but I still loved it and think its a great kids movie as well as adult movie. GO WATCH IT!","

"TANGLED","jakehadlee","31 January 2011","As the father of young girls, I get to see more than my fair share of animated movies and am used to them falling into one of two categories - either quite entertaining and well put together or excruciatingly bad. I can now a third category - brilliant.This is a wonderful piece of film-making, let alone animation. The story has superb pace, a strong narrative and genuinely engaging characters. It's funny, touching and gripping - and it looks wonderful too.Of course it has the usual stock Disney characters (feisty, independent princess, cheeky animal sidekick, comedy villains, evil mother figure etc) - but, here's the twist: they actually pull it off this time - the funny characters are funny, the leading man is charming, the princess is hugely likable.I know Toy Story 3 will win the Oscar - but I'm amazed this hasn't been nominated. TS3 fell into my first category for me (entertaining and well made) but was essentially a rehash of the themes from TS2 and was neither original nor any better than its predecessors. Tangled is simply a better film on almost every level.Tangled is the first animated film I've seen since Spirited Away where I came out the cinema thinking I'd seen a great film, not just an entertaining one.","

"TANGLED","ronjoan68","3 January 2011","This is the best Disney film I have seen. This film is superb on every level. The story is imaginative, well-told, beautifully constructed and perfectly paced. As is a Disney trademark, the music was beautiful, inspiring and woven magically and meaningfully into the story and dialogue. The lyrics were extremely clever and witty. The genius of Alan Menkin (music) and Glen Slater (lyrics) amaze me. When I got home, I immediately went to the internet to learn more about the voices behind Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) and Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy). Their singing were theatrical and outstanding. The voicing and acting were imaginative, moving and fit the story, the characters and the moment perfectly. What more can I say ? As expected, the animation was top notch Disney. Each scene was a spectacle. I'm not that emotional but I think my jaw dropped when I saw the lanterns being launched into the sky. That scene and the context in which it was shown actually brought tears to my eyes it was so beautiful. This is a movie that will appeal to all ages. I want to see it again and can't wait for the DVD. Go see it. You will love it.","

"TANGLED","Likes_Ninjas90","10 January 2011","Disney's fiftieth animated feature is an appropriation of the Rapunzel fairytale. We are told that a magic flower was found to cure a sick queen as she was giving birth to her daughter Rapunzel (Mandy Moore). Gothel (Donna Murphy), an evil old woman, learnt that the healing power of the flower was embodied in Rapunzel's hair. Gothel kidnaps the baby Rapunzel and locks her in a tower for eighteen years, telling her that she is her real mother and ensuring that her long golden hair is never cut to preserve the powers. Every year on Rapunzel's birthday her parents prepare a light show, hoping that she will return. Rapunzel wishes to see the lights for herself and asks her Gothel if she can be let out of the castle. Gothel dismisses the request, stating that it is too dangerous. Meanwhile, a thief named Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) is being hunted for stealing a tiara. During his escape he stumbles upon Rapunzel's hidden tower while Gothel is out. Rapunzel knocks him out and hides the jewel. When he awakens she promises to only tell him where it is as long as he takes her to see the lights in the sky and he reluctantly agrees. As Pixar have worked to bridge the gap between animation and more humanist narratives, Disney has returned to an old fashioned and exaggerated brand of filmmaking. Tangled feels like the sort of film that Disney would have made back in the early 90s. It's driven more by playful, slapstick humour and action rather than a multilayered plot. Yet the two main characters (voiced very enthusiastically by Levi and Moore) at least have some consciousness about their identities. Rapunzel's ethical dilemma stems from being an adolescent girl on the verge of adulthood. She is divided by feelings of excitement and anxiety to explore the real world. Rider's own identity is eventually revealed to be as fabricated as hers too, lending some minor but welcome variations to the standard Disney coming of age tale. The film is also a musical too but thankfully there are just a few of these needless numbers. Unless you are a fan of Mandy Moore's singing voice these songs just seemed dated. The lyrics are just a little too cute and clean, rather than memorable and edgy. Tangled is showing in 2D and 3D but the former showcases the film at its most luminous. The visual scheme is continuously bright, making strong use of the primary colours and enriching the film's expansive, green landscapes. In the final quarter of the film there is one sequence that is so charming and quietly beautiful that it will eventually become a signature image of Disney pictures. Interestingly, the film's very warm and cute feel is in many ways representative of Rapunzel's optimism. The colour found when her feet touch the grass for the very first time is contrasted with darker tones to the aesthetics as the danger becomes more immediate. This is no more prominent than in a surprisingly fearless and emotional climax. If the rest of the film had taken more chances with its tone and narrative, Tangled would be far more than what it is: sweet family entertainment.","

"TANGLED","tedg","30 December 2010","Sometimes the inner narrative is clear.The outer narrative is fine enough to sell tickets to parents, thinking this is what their kids want and their kids returning the favor. You'll have to read elsewhere for how well this is done. What fascinates me is how obviously we can see what concerns the animators.This is marketed not as a film in its own right, but as the 50th Disney animation. It is easy to see it as such, as a narrative about the artists.Our heroine starts the film with her obsessive two-dimensional drawings, quite literally cartoons like the initial Disney era. In these is a depiction of an event that we discover is her dream, her wish. Following the princess formula, which Disney invented, we hear her ""wish song,"" about this dream. The dream is fulfilled in ""paintery 3d"" as the main story.By the end of the film, we are reminded that her memories and the projected cartoon of the entire film has been painted on the walls of her space. There is literally a moment where they start to merge. But in between we have the layer of that cartoon in the ""real world,"" meaning the three dimensional world of the current animation technology. In that layer, we have the quest for the three dimensional experience: the losing of the lantern kites on an anniversary.When this came for me, I was overwhelmed. This was partially because the ""fold"" worked for me; The watched cartoon was on the walls and the real world was the one I shared with the characters. Disney first did this (to my knowledge) in their dinosaur movie where the ""cartoon"" was in cave paintings.The ""lights"" was an extraordinarily well done adventure in framing, editing and camera angle selection. There is no Pixar influence here — this is all homegrown Disney and now that Pixar is worn out, we may see a new generation of animated cinema here.Another reason it worked for me is the simple geometry of romantic imagination. Connection is spatial, extreme spatial experience where the senses and sense are overwhelmed. The lantern scene effectively did that for me and I admire its manipulative construction. This is very much an adult movie and very overtly sexual. The source images are in a space created by a sexually manipulative woman, managing a hidden fecund valley in which an overtly phallic tower houses our future stories.So it is extremely easy for me to see this as a story about animation, folding and sex. Pure in each regard. It is not about love. It is about drawing love, and much more romantic as a result.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","

"TANGLED","austin-takahashi","18 January 2012","Walt Disney Animation Studios has regained its touch and reclaimed its glory. After a decade of churning out animated flicks that only served as a shadow to the works of Dreamworks, they have finally created something that deserves a place in my heart. Yeah, I agree how the latter part of my previous sentence was covered with cheese. But that's how the movie made me feel – Cheesy. I developed affection for its characters, and I felt the loss in its tragedy. Also, I released a couple of blushes towards its romance. As the loveless chap that I am, I'm usually unaffected by mushy moments in movies, but not this time. ""Tangled"" is just too darn adorable. Let me share with you a quick story. My childhood was blessed beyond grace, for it was nurtured by a loving, gentle woman: my mother. As amazing as she is, we abide by the truth that nobody's perfect, and my dear mother had poor discernment when it came to animated movies. She was numb to the genre; identifying animated characters as nothing more than plastic objects. So you could tell that I was filled with delight when she informed me that she had enjoyed ""Tangled"". The makers back at Disney must have done something incredibly right. I mean, even I had a special fondness for the movie, where most of it is directed at its young princess. If Rapunzel ever gets thrown into the real world, like Amy Adam's Giselle in ""Enchanted"", I'll be the guy to catch her. And now this movie review has extra cheese.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/tangled-movie-review/","

"TANGLED","bob the moo","16 August 2020","Back when this came out I had no children, and while I did occasionally watch films aimed at children, I had no specific need to do so. Some ten years later and Disney and Pixar are much more regular in my viewing schedule, which is what led me to watch Tangled - a film I was only slightly aware of, and remembered hearing that it was not as good as other similar films. This may well be true but actually Tangled is a solidly enjoyable film throughout. The plot is broadly the Rapunzel story, but done with energy, fun, and towards the end a little of bit of touching material. As a narrative it is simple and easy to follow - which is important for children as I learnt while watching Frozen 2 and trying to figure out the messy plot and explain it simply at the same time.The animation is smooth and polished, but not to the point that it lacks character. Speaking of characters, I enjoyed all of the main ones and they were engaging and did more than the basics. The best songs are upfront and the second half of the film is noticeably lacking in numbers, but the keys ones are catchy and well written. On the whole it is a solidly enjoyable family film which is easy to follow, has a good plot, good songs, and decent laughs/adventure.","

"TANGLED","AlsExGal","5 July 2020","I loved this movie. It is the story of Rapunzel, a princess with magic hair that has the ability to heal. Rapunzel was kidnapped as a child by an old woman who wanted to stay young. She kept Rapunzel captive in a tower in the middle of nowhere, where the two of them lived for 18 years. When the old woman would start experiencing the effects of aging, she'd ask Rapunzel to sing a special song while she brushed Rapunzel's hair. Rapunzel had to sing the same song each time to activate her special powers. Every year on Rapunzel's birthday, her parents, the King and Queen, release two lighted lanterns into the sky, hoping that Rapunzel would see them and come home. Eventually everyone in the kingdom began releasing the lanterns, creating a beautiful ""starry"" sky. Rapunzel sees these glowing lights every year and wants to see the display in person. Enter Flynn Rider.Rider, a criminal, stumbles across Rapunzel's tower while on the run. He manages to climb inside the tower. Eventually after Rapunzel is understandably freaked out, she makes a deal with Rider: He must take her to the castle to see the lanterns released, and she will give back his satchel (that she's stolen and hidden) that contains the items he has stolen. Inevitably, the two fall in love and Rapunzel's ""mother"" is upset that Rapunzel is gone and seeks out to find her.This was a great movie with fun characters and fun songs. My favorite part was when Flynn takes Rapunzel on a romantic boat ride so she can view the annual lantern display from the best spot in town. The scene is so gorgeous, accompanied by a romantic song. I'm a sucker for sweet romantic stories, even if they are animated. But none top Shrek.","

"TANGLED","hans_0108","24 February 2011","This movie was one i actually really wanted to see. I have missed that little bit of Disney magic i adored as a child. So myself and a group of friends all decided to go indulge in some fun.Now we are all 16 and probably should know better but we waltzed into that cinema unashamed as parents piled in with their children. The film had us mesmerised. From the start we were aww-ing, aah-ing and laughing. It seemed we were the only one's enjoying the full experience, which actually disappointed me, as no one else seemed to be openly touched by the film.I am sure the whole audience did enjoy it, however, maybe we were more vocal. The astoundingly intricate characters were beautifully voiced and animated. Even some of our favourites, Pascal and Maximus, who couldn't speak were just amazingly animated to such a degree that it was crystal clear what they were thinking. They had our row howling with laughter as did the mischievous Flynn Rider who i loved for his rogue-ish quirk and hysterical relationship with Rapunzel, our heroine, who could also hold her own very well. I don't want to spoil anything but her choice of weapon in danger is somewhat pure comic genius and is carried throughout the film.( If you have seen the film you will know what i mean. ;p)The CGI effects of this film were fantastic and as is mentioned often; the lantern scene had us a bit misty eyed. There was a closeness we obviously felt to the characters that is also aided by our love of Disney classics.All in all if you haven't seen this film yet i demand you do because it is worth every penny and is simply a most beautiful film with a beautiful story and characters. Don't be afraid to laugh and cry it shows enjoyment! I could praise it for ages but i fear my word limit would be breached. Disney is back and i am glad, hope it carries on. Tangled is a favourite forever now.","

"TANGLED","kikigalbreath","13 April 2014","I first saw Tangled in theaters when it came out, and I absolutely loved it! I especially loved the cleverness of Flynn, and the comical jokes he brought to the film. The animation is wonderful too, and it was unlike anything I'd ever seen. One of the high points of the movie for me, though, was the songs. I truly loved all of them, especially ""I See the Light."" In my opinion, it is underrated though, and I personally think it's better than ""Let it Go."" Unfortunately, I feel like Tangled is underrated. I've seen Frozen, which is all everyone ever talks about, and I thought it was good. But now that I've put more thought into it, I feel that Tangled is much better. There are some plot holes in Frozen, with unexplained parts, but Tangled really covers everything, and I laugh at all the jokes every time! All in all, there is some breath-taking animation on display, and the actors brought the characters to life. I enjoy watching this movie every once in a while, as it brings smiles and tears to me!","

"TANGLED","OneRingToRuleThemAll13","23 March 2012","First I would like to note that when I saw the previews for this film I was as non-interested as you could get (as other people here have pointed out)! I mean, GET A MARKETING CREW!! Ughhh!! The first trailer/teaser was horrible, and like 50% of the footage shown in the teaser wasn't even included in the final movie. The second trailer was a bit better though.2 weeks ago I finally gave up (after about 5 times of hearing from my soon-to-be sister-in-law that it was awesome and beautiful), and while I was in the hospital I asked my aunt to rent it for me so we could watch it on my sister's laptop. The first thing that went through my mind when the movie started was ''Huh... I guess this movie is just another attempt at Disney wanting to be cool and romantic while TRYING TO BE FUNNY!! :@@@''. Boy, was I wrong...This movie is everything you could possibly want from a modern Disney movie (which is saying a LOT since Disney isn't the same as it was in the days of yore). It has lots of action, beautiful CGI animation, great humor, awesome and deeply developed characters (which were voiced really well), and of course what would a traditional Disney movie be without awesome songs (more on that later)???!The story is (as you most probably know already) centered on a girl named Rapunzel, who after her mother (while still pregnant with Rapunzel) falls gravely ill and is cured by a magical, golden flower, gains beautiful, golden hair which can be used to heal people and give people eternal youth while singing it a special song (yes, it sounds kind of girly, but hey! I'm a 15-year-old boy and I ADORE THIS MOVIE!). A few days after her birth an old woman (referred to as Mother Gothel in the movie, and had been using the flower to stay young forever for centuries before the flower was used to heal Rapunzel's mother), visits Rapunzel's nursery and tries to cut a strand of Rapunzel's hair and starts singing the song, but is quickly stopped when she realizes that if you cut the hair, it turns brown and loses it's power. Faced with a difficult predicament, Gothel decides to steal the child and raise her as her own in order to stay young forever. I won't spoil anymore, so that you can enjoy the movie for it's amazing story. The voice-acting in this movie is spot-on (even though only 2 of the people involved in the cast are actually high-profile actors)! Mandy Moore as Rapunzel and Zachary Levi as Flynn Rider (the ''prince'' in the movie and Rapunzel's love interest), really give life to their characters, have great chemistry with each other, and they both sing beautifully. Donna Murphy is also excellent as Gothel, giving her character the necessary sarcasm and fake sweetness which surprisingly flawless skill, considering I'd never heard of her before.The songs are my favorite part of the movie. They make you feel full of joy in a world that is slowly turning into a world of violence and corruption, and that is something all of us need right now, and is usually not present in today's movies, which are usually full of over- the-top violence, sex and pervasive language. Don't worry, though, as you will not find ANY of those things here. There is one particular song in the movie that is easily one of the best Disney songs out there, and is so romantic and beautiful I just want to dance and smile whenever I hear it :')All in all, ''Tangled'' is an excellent family movie, and has something in it for everyone (even boys and adults, which at first glance doesn't seem to be the target demographic in these type of film). Keep it up, Disney!!!","

"TANGLED","anaconda-40658","5 February 2016","Tangled (2010): Dirt: Nathan Greno, Byron Howard / Voices: Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi, Donna Murphy, Ron Perlman, Brad Garrett: In the tradition of Hoodwinked here is another animated twisted take on a fairy tale. The theme is authority as Rapunzel is born with hair of healing power due to a rare flower used to heal her mother before her birth. She is kidnapped and raised in isolation within a tower by a woman who uses Rapunzel's singing power to render her youth. Animation is colorful and dazzling and directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard have a field day with tampering with the original concept. Mandy Moore voices Rapunzel, sheltered from the outside world by an evil hag. Now eighteen she desires to see the lights that only appear on her birthday. These lights are actually lanterns issued by the King and Queen in hopes that their daughter will one day return. Zachary Levi voices a thief named Eugene whose theft of a crown leads to shelter in the tower before being ambushed by Rapunzel. She makes a deal that will allow him to keep the crown if he will take her to the strange lights. This leads to a tremendous twist ending that honors sacrifice and surprise. Donna Murphy voices the hag whose loss of the age flower led to her kidnapping Rapunzel and corrupting her mind, but her defeat works best due to its method. Ron Perlman is also on board as well as Brad Garrett but many of these roles are cardboard. While it satirizes the fairy tale effectively it also creates humour and adventure to the appeal to families whom will want to get tangled up in it. Score: 9 ½ / 10","

"TANGLED","ja_kitty_71","14 December 2010","It was about time that any animation studio would make a film based on one of my favorite fairy-tales, Rapunzel, and I was glad Disney was the studio to make it. I saw the film only last weekend, and I thought it was awesome.The film goes like this : A magical golden flower with the power to heal was born from one ray of sunshine. A nasty woman known as Gothel uses the flower's power to restore her youth and beauty. A few centuries later, a kingdom was built, and just as the king and queen were going to have a baby, the pregnant queen became very ill. The people searched the land for the golden flower. Until the royal army spotted the flower and bought it back to the queen. Then a baby girl (Rapunzel) was born to the royal couple, and everyone in the land was happy. All except jealous, spiteful Gothel, who has learned that Rapunzel's golden hair retains the flower's healing abilities as long as it isn't cut, so she kidnaps the child and isolates her in a tower, raising the girl as her own daughter. However, every year on Rapunzel's birthday, the kingdom sends thousands of floating lanterns into the sky, longing for their lost princess to return.Eighteen years later, a thief known as Flynn Rider steals the lost princess' tiara and escapes the guards. Then he came upon Rapunzel's tower as a hiding place. Once he had scaled the tower, Flynn was held by the girl with the long hair. Rapunzel then strikes a deal with the charming thief to act as her guide to travel to the place where the floating lights come from that she has seen every year on her birthday. That's all I have to say; you'll have to see the film for yourself to find out how it ends, and, I know I say it all the time, but I don't have a favorite scene because I love the entire film.","

"TANGLED","lisafordeay","5 February 2011","As a lover for fairy tales like The Little Mermaid ,Beauty & the Beast and Aladdin,Disney went downhill with their last movie The Princess & the Frog and since then there wasn't a decent flick since 2007's Enchanted which was my all time favorite animated/live action movie.Yesterday I went to the cinemas by myself and I saw Tangled. Tangled is an up to date version of the classic Brother Grimns story Rapunzel. The story opens with a male voice telling the tale about a princess who was abducted by an evil woman named Mother Gothel who stoled the baby from her parents as she has healing magic powers that can heal and turn an old person back into their youthful form. Apparently the princesses's mother was sick and the guards from the palace found a healing flower and that is why Gothel stole the child. Fast forward a few years later and Rapunzel(voiced by MANDY MOORE)wishes to see the lantern lights as they appear every year for her birthday and she was celebrating her 18th birthday but Mother Gothel(voiced by DONNA MURPHY)doesn't want Rapunzel to leave the tower ever. Meanwhile a dashing rogue thief named Flynn Rider(who's real name is Eugene Fitzherbert)(voiced by Zac Levi)steals a crown from the palace and as he tries to find the perfect hideout for the stolen crown he spots a isolated tower and climbs up to the top,little does he realize he gets hit by a frying pan(yeah a frying pan )from Rapunzel who thinks Flynn is interested in her long 70ft blonde hair which glows when she sings that HEALING INCANTATION song. She hides the satchel where Flynn can't find it and she makes a deal with him that she will give it back to him if he takes her to see the lanterns for her 18th birthday and as she leaves her tower for the first time in 18 years she is about to go on a hair-raising hilarious adventure where she falls in love,and sees the outside world for the first time.The animation in this film is so exquisite part of you would think its a live action movie and not CGI. The music(done by the brilliant composer of our generation ALAN MENKEN)was brilliant and memorable especially the songs I SEE THE LIGHT(both sung by LEVI & MOORE),WHEN WILL MY LIF E BEGIN,and the villain song MOTHER KNOWS BEST. The story was brilliant yet kind slow enough to follow but as the film progressed I fell head over heels in love with the charcthers and the story I never blinked not once and I never looked at my watch throughout the 1hr and 36 mins. Mandy Moore was perfect for the voice role of Rapunzel I loved how her charcther progresses throughout the film and I love how she and Flynn(aka Eugene Fitzherbert I think this name is nice btw very Irish indeed)don't see eye to eye but they soon fall for one another when they see the lanterns (which was brilliant I must say I loved that part)and sing the song I SEE THE LIGHT(brilliant love song I can't get the song out of my head).ZAC LEVI was so hilarious in this film ('Her hair glows why does her hair glow' or 'Oh no no no this is not good they just can't get my nose right) I think Eugene Fitzherbert is the hottest Disney charcther alive. One scene that had me in tears(well almost)was the part where he apparently dies and before that he chops off Rapunzel's 70 ft hair that turns back into brown and he dies. She sings that healing song and her tears brought him back to life. The finale was so cute and heartwarming. TANGLED is without a doubt one of the best Disney animated films I have ever seen in my entire life since Beauty & the Beast(yes people it was THAT GOOD). Its got romance,memorable music,lovable charcthers,heartwarming ending,hilarious moments from the horse Maximus who had me in tears of laughter and the cute chameleon Pascal who uses his tongue to wake up Eugene when he gets knocked out from the frying pan incident and exquisite animation. I may be 19 going on 20 but this was the best 1 hr and 36 Min's of my life. Simply enchanting.BEST QUOTE:Eugene Fitzhebert: ""You were my new dream""Rapunzel:(cries)""And you were mine""BEST SCENE: The lantern scene was amazing I simply loved it so much.orThe part where Flynn almost dies and he sacrifice's Rapunzel's hair by chopping it all off. If you liked Stardust(evil woman wants girl for youth),Anastasia(lost princess falls for a bad boy),Shrek(hilarious adult humor), and The Little mermaid(boat scene)you will love this.FINAL VERDICT: Tangled is an instant classic that should be treasured for the rest of your life.10/10 Brilliant simply amazing I am in love with this film. Move over Princess & the frog this film is here to stay. But I hope they won't decide to do a sequel as it will ruin the magic in this film.","

"TANGLED","ElMaruecan82","13 April 2016","When it comes to setting up the story, ""Tangled"" doesn't take chances, it goes straightforwardly to the point like most Disney movies do, and that's the privilege movies based on fairy tales can afford, we expect them to begin by ""Once Upon a Time "".So, once upon a time  Gothel, a vain woman who found the power of eternal youth in a flower that magically grew out of a sunshine drop. Unfortunately for her, the flower is taken by the Royal guards and is used to cure the Queen right before she gives birth to Rapunzel, a beautiful girl with long glowing hair. Gothel understands the hair have inherited a part of the flower's powers, but when she cuts them, it turns to a plain (and powerless) brown. She then kidnaps Rapunzel and traps her in a tower where she treats her like a mother.18 years later, Rapunzel grew with such a long and thick head of hair, she can actually hang on them, dangled from them and seize things like a chameleon's tongue, which is a funny coincidence since her pet friend is a charming chameleon named Pascal. Rapunzel is also a beautiful creature (who strangely reminded me of Amanda Seyfried) confident about her hair's healing power but like any girl of her age, she's got fears and issues. For one thing, she never discovered the world, and can only watch the stars that illuminate the sky, ignoring that those that appear every year during her birthday, are sky lanterns launched by the king and the townspeople as a desperate attempt to reach her. There is a lot of glowing in the film, but there's more than yellow brightness to that.""Tangled"" is the 50th animated Disney film, it is a long way back to ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" but there are similarities despite the seven-decade gap. Like ""Snow White"", it's a story of a fallen princess held prisoner by an abusive 'mother-figure'. And if Snow White found escapism while looking for a Prince, Rapunzel found a prince while looking for escapism. Like ""Snow White"", ""Tangled"" was the most expensive animated movie of its time and the product of a great combination of talent and perfectionism, like ""Snow White"", it's based on a Grimm brothers story, and provides everything children and grown-ups except from fairy tale while translating to the big screen: action, fun, visuals, romance, fantasy, magic, emotions and a memorable villain.To a certain extent, ""Tangled"" is Disney coming full circle with the very magic that enchanted many generations from all over the word, with a creation made for the 2010's but not so far in spirit, from the enchantment of the old classics. It's a delight to the eyes and it features two irresistible leading protagonists, in charm and personality, a not-so rebellious girl and a not-so unredeemable criminal, named Flynn Rider, a guy actually sensitive about his nose and wrapped up in the conviction that he's the most charming person on Earth. And for a change, the two characters don't really start their relationship through mutual dislike, their encounter is rather funny and uses some slapstick rarely exploited in legitimate Disney features.It needs to be pointed out that ""Tangled"" belongs to one of the most refreshingly funny Disney movies. Seriously, how many of them feature a horse that is more efficient than his rider and is obsessed to the point you might discuss his psychological sanity or wish he was in the good guys' side? How many feature a frying pan as a deadly weapon and running gag? How many Disney movies feature frightening pub regulars who dream to be pianists or pantomimes', or a giant thug whose secret passion is to collect miniature unicorns? Describing these gags doesn't do them even justice because they work so well on a visual level. But I mention them because they highlight the best thing about ""Tangled"" humor : it's unpredictable even when relying on predictable situations.Another example is that ""Tangled"" follows a simple and conventional plot-line through the heroin's journey, basically, her discovery of the real world leading to her self-discovery until the final confrontation with the mother (with a few Oedipal undertones). But the plot matters less than the rich gallery of colorful characters it invites us to discover and personality traits of the two heroes that manages to transcend the usual requirements. The 'hero' is handsome but takes himself so seriously that he becomes pathetic, she's a free-spirited, idealistic and barefoot-walking teen who enjoys discovering the real world, but she's also reluctant to disappoint the woman she still believes is her mother. These traits are first mocked until they're exploited for more dramatic effects.Overall, the dosage is well done and makes the romance between the two outcasts believable. Naturally, some parts get predictable, when Gothel warns Rapunzel about Flynn looking only for the crown he stole, we know there'll be a quid pro quo, where she'd believe Mommy was right, but the conventional stuff is handled pretty quickly and the final third act is surprisingly efficient in its minimalism: no fight scene, no overdose of action and kinetic special effects, a simple display of love gestures and the perfect spectacular ending and feel-good twist. Rapunzel, in the tradition of coming-of-age stories, which are why fairy-tales were made for, was ready to trade her freedom for Flynn's life while Flynn decided his death was worth Rapunzel's freedom.This is the stuff great romances and fairy tales are made on. There are a few little things to criticize, some songs are less inspired and more forgettable than Menken's usual work, and the title could've been better chosen, ""Rapunzel"" would've done fine actually. Still, I believe ""Tangled"" is one of the best Disney films, one that magnificently reconciles between the old and the new.","

"TANGLED","aquariusgirl279","8 December 2010","I've wanted to see Tangled since I heard about it. I must have heard about it back in July. Maybe earlier. I remember seeing the teaser trailer where it just had the voices and the tower. Rapunzel was always my favorite of the Grimm Fairy Tales. I must be the only person in the world, but back when Less Than Perfect was on, I used to watch it. That's when my love for Zachary Levi began. I always liked him. I thought he was hilarious and Kipp was easily my favorite character. So when he was cast on Chuck, I started watching that show and I'm so glad I did. It's easily one of my favorite shows and it has only made my love for Zachary Levi grow exponentially. So when I heard he was cast as the ""prince"" I was so thrilled beyond belief. I couldn't wait. I remember thinking, ""I have to wait until Thanksgiving?!"" When I saw the first trailer, I legitimately squealed with excitement. Especially because Zachary Levi's character Flynn wasn't a prince, but a handsome and arrogant thief. My favorite kind of guy! Now I've finally seen Tangled and it surpassed my already extremely high expectations. I can't believe I didn't realize it was going to have music (why else would Mandy Moore be cast?) I felt extremely silly and thought, ""Of course. This is a Disney Princess movie."" I thought the movie was phenomenal. I already had incredibly high expectations and the movie was everything I expected and more. I thought it was a very interesting and creative take on Rapunzel. I've read the actual Grimm Fairy Tale, and it's true that it barely follows it. It just basically used the idea. From the first song to the last song, I loved every minute of this highly entertaining tale. Of course Mandy Moore did her own singing and then the first song came and Zachary Levi did his own too. And you know what? He wasn't even half bad. (Just another thing that makes me love him). I wasn't extremely stunned by how amazing he was and I don't really have an ear for music or technology, but it didn't sound like his voice was edited all that much (but that's just me). You know how you hear those girls singing on Disney and it kind of sounds like a robot/computer is singing? Well, it didn't sound like that. And I know Zachary Levi's speaking voice very well (I've been watching him on TV for years) and it sure sounded like him. I was pleasantly surprised. And of course, I'm a sucker for a Disney Princess movie. Rapunzel was very tough, which I liked, kind of like Tiana from Princess and the Frog. And I liked how the romance definitely developed through their adventures. Having read the actual Grimm Fairy Tale in which the prince falls out the window after being tricked by Mother Gothel into coming in and goes blind, I had a guess as to what was going to happen to Flynn after he cut Rapunzels hair. In the original tale, Rapunzel cried on him and his eye sight was restored, leading me to believe that her tears would bring him back to life. I have to admit though, I was a bit nervous as was my friend who didn't know as much about the original tale. Anyway, I should wrap this up. The movie looked gorgeous (wouldn't expect less from Disney), the music was great, I loved the voice acting (anyone else notice Brad Garrett as the guy with the hook hand?!), I loved the storyline, I loved the new princess, I loved the new prince. I loved the new, creative look at a classic fairy (especially turning the prince into a thief; I thought that was brilliant). So if you couldn't tell, I enjoyed the movie. Quite a bit. I would recommend it to anyone. I don't have anything to say about the 3D as I saw it in 2D (3D makes me physically nauseous). But I enjoyed it so much, I've seen in twice and I might go again next week.","

"TANGLED","kimme-kimono","27 November 2010","I have not been a fan of many Disney movies since the ""Lion King,"" and the few I have liked have been done with Pixar (WallE, TS3, Nemo). I grew up in the Disney Renaissance of the late 80s and early 90s and this is the first movie if have seen since the Fabulous Four that makes me believe Disney still has a place in the film business. The only down side is the soundtrack. I love Alan Menken-the first play I ever saw as 6 year old was ""Little Shop of Horror"" and the first movie I saw in theaters as two year old was ""The Little Mermaid."" I had high hopes for the soundtrack but there was not another ""Under the Sea"" in the score. Disney fans and connoisseurs will tell you before a robot brought humans back to earth, before some toys came to life, before a lion became a king, before Aladin unleashed the Genie and before Beauty tamed the Beast there was a Little Mermaid who single-handedly saved the Disney animation studio. I hope in the future we will be saying the same thing about a blonde-haired girl who spent most of her life locked in a tower!I know this is not really a good review, but for all you Disney skeptics that feel let down from the Princess and the Frog and Meet the Robinsons-this is worth your time!","

"TANGLED","CinemaClown","10 April 2016","Walt Disney Animation Studios' 50th animated feature still carries the label of the most expensive animated film ever made but it is also noteworthy for reversing the odds in the legendary studio's favour for Tangled marks the commencement of Disney's Revival Era and begins the studio's long- awaited resurgence towards its lost glory.Tangled tells the story of Rapunzel, a young princess whose magical hair have healing properties, for which she was kidnapped by an old witch who then raises her as her own child. Having spent her entire life in an isolated tower, Rapunzel is curious to explore the world outside, and ultimately leaves her home to embark on a magnificent journey of self-discovery.Co-directed by Nathan Greno & Byron Howard, Tangled features all the hallmarks of a Disney fairy tale yet what eventually separates it from other similar examples is its clever combination of old & new. Despite having a simple structure & treading on familiar routes, there's ample freshness in its story, the characters are beautifully carved and the animation evokes a deep sense of warmth too.Blending the best of both traditional & computer animation, the 3D images retain the painting-like quality of hand-drawn style with pixel-perfect depth & sharpness of CGI and it is absolutely drop- dead gorgeous to look at, especially that lantern sequence which can easily rival anything that the studio has put up before or since, and its old-fashioned vibe only adds more richness to the story.Also returning to the fold is Alan Menken who contributes with a mesmerising score & fitting songs and even though they aren't very catchy, they work in the film's favour. Further benefiting the story is its fluid camera-work, tight editing & brisk pace plus the voice cast does a splendid job with their respective characters, the relation dynamics are sensibly explored, and the palace horse Maximus easily stands out.On an overall scale, Tangled is a fresh breath of life from the studio that had been sitting dormant for years and the way Disney manages to turn things around is by going back to its fairy tale roots, albeit with a reinvigorated passion, creative energy & upgraded visual flair. Delightfully refreshing, surprisingly heartfelt & scoring big on quality entertainment, Tangled is one of the finest entries in Disney's repertoire. Definitely recommended.","

"TANGLED","blackwidowis7cool","12 August 2019","I must confess that I was a bit unsure about watching Disney's version of the tale of Rapunzel - partially because I secretly enjoyed the original tale and was worried about what they would do with it and also partially due to the fact that I didn't think it would make that great a film. But, I decided to sit down and watch it, anyway.
I had grown used to Disney's new style of story telling - in movies such as Zootopia, Frozen, Wreck-It Ralph, and Big Hero 6, and Brave. I quite love this new style, which felt more...I don't know, real. So, when the movie started, I was quite surprised to find that Tangled wasn't like any of these movies, and was done in old Disney style with narrations, and immediately revealing who the villain is, and several other big reveals right at the start instead of being revealed later in the movie like they do now. It was like a mixture of old Disney classic story telling with a bit of Looney Tunes thrown in.
At first I was unsure how this would play out, but I actually quite enjoy how they told in the old Disney classic way. In fact, without the narration at the start, I don't think some parts of the film (particularly with Mother Gothel and Rapunzel at the start) would have made much sense.
The animation and attention to detail was quite good and very enjoyable. I rather like and appreciate some of the changes made to the story - such as instead of a prince, the movie makers make it a thief called Flynn Rider, a thief that you just can't help but love. Flynn is full of himself, witty, great at thieving, sly, and just a really likeable guy - oh, and Rapunzel's love interest. Zachary Levi does an excellent job with Flynn - made him quite funny. Mandy Moore does a great job as the main character Rapunzel. She is the perfect voice for the naive, outgoing, bubbly, fish-out-of-water character that Rapunzel is. But Rapunzel can also handle herself and her natural charm helps them out of bad situations in hilarious ways.
The songs were quite good and catchy - my personal favourite is I've got a dream. Very hilarious and old-fashioned Disney song. I also loved how Disney made a crack or two at themselves in the movie.
And because it's Disney, we can excuse the implausibility of some of the scenes and some of the all-around cheesy and silly parts - though there was one scene which I thought was a bit overdone and quite stupid. At first it was funny, but as it continued it began to feel stupid and pushed.
The climax was excellent and very tense and emotional. I couldn't help but notice similarities between Tangled and Frozen - such as with Rapunzel and Anna both being outgoing females who are isolated from the world and both going on an adventure and teaming up with rough diamonds like Flynn and Kristoff. Then there's the climax. I noticed quite a few similarities there. I thought it was interesting, considering the fan theory of Tangled and Frozen taking place in the same universe and Elsa, Anna, and Rapunzel being cousins.
Donna Murphy was very, very good as Mother Gothel - Disney's last classic villain. Very evil, conniving, dark villain. Overall it is a great movie - particularly due to the old-fashioned classic storytelling style it was told in. There was a very minor hiccup, but otherwise quite good and I love it. If you like classic Disney movies, then this movie is for you.","

"TANGLED","r96sk","20 August 2020","An enjoyable tale about Rapunzel.'Tangled' kicks off Disney's animated releases for the 2010s in very strong fashion. It's nicely created, with fun characters and a hearty storyline. It actually sets a lot of the foundations that 2013's 'Frozen' uses, there's a fair amount of similarities between the two.Mandy Moore does a terrific job in the lead role, she's brings an energetic edge to the character alongside good humour. Zachary Levi (Flynn) and Donna Murphy (Mother Gothel) are more than decent in their respective parts. You also have the amusing (non-speaking) Maximus.It's still very much the usual fairytale/princess thing, but it manages to add a lively turn to proceedings which keeps it entertaining.","

"TANGLED","Vartiainen","28 June 2016","Disney's 50th animated canon feature film - though they cheated by retroactively adding Dinosaur into the list - and in many ways a brilliant comeback for the studio.Tangled, based on the story Rapunzel by Brothers Grimm, feels very familiar if you grew up with the Disney Renaissance films. It's a princess movie, with lots of action, brilliant animation and lots of song numbers. Yet you can definitely see the decade or two that separates it from the Renaissance. Rapunzel is a very different kind of heroine. You can see a lot of Belle and Ariel in her, perhaps even a bit of Mulan, but she is very much a princess for the new century. Very dynamic, very ready with words, very quirky even. The same with our ""prince"", Flynn Rider, who is to Aladdin what Aladdin was to the princes of the 40s and 50s, while still being very kid friendly and accessible. They both have this attitude to them. And while at times it can be a bit heavy-handed, I do admit liking the update. For the most part.I also really like the villain, Mother Gothel. She's what you would get if you took Lady Tremaine from Cinderella, but made her more subtle. She's very clearly an abusive parent, but you're not quite certain if the abuse is intentional or whether she just doesn't know any other way. Her relationship with Rapunzel is one of the more fascinating parent-child dynamics I've yet seen from Disney.And overall it's just a fun film, exactly what you should expect from Disney. It can seem a bit calculated from time to time, especially when it comes to the Dreamworks-esque hipness of the main characters, but it's still a good adventure and solid entertainment all around. Recommended for all fans of Disney and good, solid animation.Though the name of the film should have been Rapunzel! Curse you, overly cautious marketing.","

"TANGLED","FilmFreak94","30 April 2011","My history with Tangled is a rocky one. Like many people I was disappointed with the trailer and thought that Disney was trying to copy off the formula that made Shrek famous. The tile change from Rapunzel to Tangled didn't sit well for me at the time either. Before I even saw the film I thought that it would be a huge disaster.Thankfully, Disney proved me wrong. Tangled is one of the best Disney films I've seen in a very long time. The story is well written and the characters are all very enjoyable(the horse and the chameleon steal the show). The animation for Tangled can only be described in one word... 'beautiful.' Every little detail in this movie, from the backgrounds to the crowds of people, are perfectly animated. The two things that stand out are the floating lanterns scene and Rapunzel's hair. Admitadely, the songs took awhile for me to get used to. It felt as though Alan Menken wasn't really on his A-game when he did Tangled, but that doesn't necessarily mean the songs are awful, you'll just need to listen to them a few times before they really grow on you. Overall Tangled is by far one of the best films to come out of Disney in a long time. If you have kids or if you're just a fan of animation then you should definitely give Tangled a look.","

As an adult, I too enjoyed the film, though, not totally.After watching masterstrokes like 'Up' and 'Toy Story 3' recently, I've raised my expectations way too much from an animation flick. As I had heard the legend of Rapunzel as a kid, 'Tangled' didn't offer much novelty to me. But despite the popular story it adapts, the film holds you, especially in the first hour, which is superb. The only shortcoming in this love-story, is the overdose of Songs. They keep popping up, and one truly wishes if they weren't hammered so many times.Looking from the point of view kids mainly, I suggest you do make your kids watch 'Tangled', as it will be a dazzling & memorable experience for them. And I'd say for those, who still are a kid at heart, do watch it... the spell-binding animation & 3D effects are sure to keep you energized.","

It's be interpreted in so many different ways over the years, that it was about time that Disney had a go! As usual, they didn't disappoint. With its stunning animation, heartwarming story line and lovable characters, Tangled is in many ways, a perfect movie. As a Disney kid, my opinion on most Disney movies is extremely biased, but I can promise you, hand on heart, that Tangled is worth watching. It keeps you entertained from start to finish, and tops it off with a sickly sweet ending, classic Disney style! Take it from someone who has watched this movie more times than most, has read the ""Art Of"" book from cover to cover and has an unhealthy obsession with it. Ignore the hate, and just give it a go, because you won't be left unsatisfied...","

After a great decade of films in the 1990's, Disney Animations begun to release lesser quality films....until this film, which is leading the surge of what's to come. This film recaptures the magic of early Disney films and it shows I can renew my faith in Disney. This film is beautifully-animated and has such wonderful songs one can sit back and sing along with.Bryon Howard's film is about a princess named Rapunzel who has special anti-aging powers because of her hair and is kidnapped by an old witch for her powers and is not allowed to leave her tower. But one day, she comes across a thief named Flynn Rider whose paths were destined to cross.The voice-cast is not too bad. Hardly anybody too famous here, but they all do their job quite well. Mandy Moore is the biggest name here and she does a great job as Rapunzel. Zachary Levi brings some wit and charm as Flynn Rider.Overall, Tangled is a great Disney film because it clearly has magic running through its veins. It's beautifully-animated, tells a great story, and it just has you wanting more. It's not the best Disney film, but looking at the films that came a decade before this film, it's a big improvement over those films. I rate this film 9/10.","

And it was genuinely funny!! Also, the songs were actually good! I usually hate singing in animated films, and sometimes Disney films can have the sappiest, schlockiest songs. But these were wonderful. The song ""Mother Knows Best"" is a combination of great lyrics, great singing, and great emoting on the part of the actress/vocalist who performed it.

"TANGLED","freemantle_uk","17 May 2014","Disney has one of the greatest animation studios around and has fans all around the world. After a long hiatus the studio returned to fairy adaptations. With Tangled they retold the story of Rapunzel and Disney delivered a delightful family film, filled with humour and comedy, brilliant and colourful animation (which is terrific on Blu-ray), action and drama. They is plenty of slapstick reminiscence to the Looney Toons, particularly been the leading male character and the a very determined horse. They are verbal jokes and gags through character interactions. Donna Murphy gave us an interesting villain, someone who is a more subtle and manipulative character on Rapunzel and adds a mother-daughter dynamic. The songs are sadly a little more pop princess and not particularly memorial. The stand out song is 'Mother Knows Best', sounding similar to 'Master of the House' from Les Mis and the visuals match the song well. Good viewing if you want something light-hearted.On minor nitpick I have is that I thought Rapunzel's mouth was too big.","

"TANGLED","kosmasp","20 January 2011","Since Pixar has taken over creative control over Disney projects, they have gone up. Not only financially but also creatively. And it shows in the outcome of this movie too. While there might be a musical number or two too many in this one, they are still pretty rare. And if you can endure them, you will be treated to a very funny movie. With animals that might not sing (or talk for that matter), but do have a mind of their own nonetheless.And it's the animals that almost outshine the human (drawn) cast. But while the story is predictable, you will find yourself cheering for the all the right reasons (if you are not too pessimistic that is, of course). Or too cynical. It was the last movie I watched in 2010 in cinemas and I was not disappointed!","

"TANGLED","j-hunt01","1 February 2011","'I don't do back story' claims an arrogant Flynn Rider - the outlawed central male character of Disney's 'Tangled' - when his history is probed by Rapunzel, his equally headstrong female counterpart. Incidentally, 'Tangled' doesn't do back story either, or even side plots for that matter; viewers are brought up to speed in a narrated introduction that gives us the who, what, why, where and when in an account given by the aforementioned criminal, revealing information in a biased light and missing an opportunity to explore the motivations of characters seen in the opening scene. This would be a detriment to many a film in which the tactic would be seen as lazy, however, 'Tangled' is solely focused on the growth of its dynamic duo and every other plot device and supporting character serves only as a catalyst for Flynn and Rapunzel's development. Interaction between other characters, such as the King and Queen who lost their daughter, is limited, but these omissions aren't vital as the emotional investment of the film is purely concentrated on its main characters. In a film about a girl who hasn't set foot outside for eighteen years, Disney appropriately isolate Rapunzel even more in her own story as she ventures beyond her tower for the first time.Immediately noteworthy is the overall style of the screenplay, which resembles the witty tone and slapstick of a Dreamworks Animation product, particularly that of Shrek. It's refreshing to see Disney dabble in humour like this as Pixar and Dreamworks are both so black and white in their methods that I have never before witnessed a blend of their approaches as I have in 'Tangled', where heavy character work and physical sidekick antics compliment each other consistently, giving the film a real family-friendly consistency. While Disney may have come under fire for marketing the film towards both male and female demographics, dismissing a focus on the princess, the studio proves an unevenly skewed fairy tale can resonate with all audiences. Kidnapped from the palace as a child by an ageing hag, Rapunzel is hidden away so her captor can utilise the magic in the princess' golden locks to restore her youthful beauty whenever need be. As her prisoner grows older and more inquisitive, it becomes increasingly more difficult to suppress her thoughts of leaving; until the day that Flynn Rider, looking for a place to hide from the law, stumbles upon the tower. Joining Flynn on the run from the respective forces of authority ruling over them, Rapunzel is faced with realising her past and understanding the true nature of the world beyond her window. Aided by her pet chameleon, the hilariously silent Pascal, and a grumpy, defected police horse named Maximus, the pair become intertwined in the complexity of each other's situations. Twisting the archetype of the evil stepmother, Disney have shaped an unforgettably manipulative enemy in Rapunzel's keeper, and viewers will hang on every cunning, contradicting word she speaks throughout; the land equivalent of Ursula ('The Little Mermaid'), Disney merchandise in her image won't exactly be flying off the shelves in a hurry.Five years in development and amassing what is currently believed to be the second highest budget for a feature film ever, the tech of 'Tangled' is justifiably breathtaking. Animating human forms is no longer the issue it once was, with close-ups of Rapunzel and Flynn proudly included now that their faces can express emotions so clearly (fifteen years ago 'Toy Story' routinely depicted characters from the waist down). Their world is picturesque, where each blade of glass falls with weight and water flows according to the laws of physics. Arguably a character in its own right, Rapunzel's hair is lush and textured, and its length is managed in genius and humorous manners. These visuals strengthen many sequences which will no doubt become iconic, particularly a scene set at night where hundreds of glowing fire lanterns illuminate the sky and water. Scored by Alan Menken, who follows a genre-specific approach like the jazz and gospel laden 'The Princess and the Frog', the soundtrack is typically touching, though time will tell if the musical numbers of 'Tangled' will be memorable in years to come; they don't convey the great sense of scale the characters are facing so well as, for example, 'Part of That World' (The Little Mermaid') or 'A Whole New World' ('Aladdin'), where the lyrics encapsulate the concept of the entire movie in a more grandiose way. Described as a combination of medieval music and folk rock, the music is suitably theatrical and at times pantomime, striking a chord with the persevering lightheartedness of the film, while Menken's scoring is rousing and accentuates each character well.Introducing a lovable family of characters and maintaining a return to form that began with 'The Princess and the Frog' , 'Tangled' is a successful fairy tale adaptation that lets its hair down for the sake of having a good time, proving that the tradition of the classic fairy tale is one that should be fiddled with, rather than forgotten.9/10","

"TANGLED","Smells_Like_Cheese","6 December 2010","Can you believe it? Disney has reached it's 50th animated film and what way to celebrate a wonderful magical company but with another princess story. We've had the pleasure of adding Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast to the magnificent list of best animated movies of all time despite all virtually having the same story. The reason being is because even though they were all the same story, they all had something different to offer with animation, songs, characters and along with other Disney classics like The Lion King, Aladdin or The Jungle Book(you know there's more titles of course) we've always opened our hearts to these classic stories. Disney takes on an old fairytale of Rapunzel and what way to celebrate but with CGI animation, again. Tangled is a very good film but it's not the instant classic that Disney needed. Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie, it's got great animation, lots of humor and very lovable characters.One night, Gothel, an evil selfish old lady kidnaps Princess Rapunzel who has magic gold hair that can keep Gothel looking young and living forever; she isolates the princess in a tower as her own daughter. Eighteen years later, Rapunzel tells Gothel that she wishes to see the floating lights that appear on her birthday every year, but Gothel rejects her by telling Rapunzel that the world is a dangerous place. Meanwhile, the thief Flynn Rider and his twin thugs heist the tiara of the missing princess from the castle. As they flee, Flynn abandons the twins, allowing the pursuing castle guards to capture them. Flynn happens upon Rapunzel's tower to hide in, only to be held captive by Rapunzel and her pet chameleon, Pascal. Rapunzel bargains with Flynn that if he escorts her to the lights and back, she will return the tiara; Flynn agrees. But as they go into the city, Rapunzel starts to feel something familiar as everyone talks about the lost princess that was stolen years ago.I guess for Disney's 50th animated picture I wanted a little more, look at me, I'm talking like the Disney princess almost singing how I want more. The songs were not too catchy, except for the dream song at the bar, that was very humorous and a good time to watch. Another thing I liked about the film is that it seems like a lot of animated films are relying too much on pop culture for humor and can be too trendy at times, I like that we went back to the old fairy tale. However, couldn't we have done hand drawn animation? I miss that a lot, it has this certain charm and felt like the animators took the time and effort, I know that CGI animation is cheaper and faster, so it can make an audience member feel a little cheated. I also know that 3D is big, but again why always go with trendy? This isn't what Walt Disney intended with his company I'm sure. But still would I recommend Tangled? Absolutely, and I can't wait for the DVD to add to my Disney collection, this was a terrific film for the whole family to enjoy. After all, it has a horse that makes Dirty Harry look like Barney and I feel bad for that chameleon who I guess should have stolen the show but lets face it, that horse deserves a spin off sequel now. Disney, let's get Max his own movie! Well, I hope that Disney takes my tip about the hand drawn animation, let's go back to the good old days.8/10","

They are usually very candy floss and the songs are mostly syrupy sweet. But Tangled is surprisingly fun as both the male and female leads are really well written and performed beautifully. Romance mostly takes the backseat & adventure becomes the focus. The songs are really well situated and lifts the story. One of the Better Princess Movies out there.","

I watched Frozen last week, and I was looking for something cute and inoffensive to watch, to help me soothe my anxiety. Tangled was not what I expected at all, in the best way possible!I very rarely laugh at comedies, even ones that are targeted at adults, let alone kids, but holy moly, this movie is actually hilarious! None of the clichéd, predictable jokes - these are all golden, and make a grown man laugh out loud!I also love how emotional this movie is, I was completely invested, not even looking at my phone even once (and that's saying something). I got very attached to the characters, they are extremely easy to love.As much as I enjoyed Frozen, Tangled simply blows it out of the water, it is funnier, has more loveable and developed characters and has a bigger emotional impact.This is truly a masterpiece.","

"TANGLED","TourettesPersonal","13 February 2011","My first glance of ""Tangled"" I thought it's gonna be an ordinary CGI Disney flick but it turns out to be a magical movie that brings back all the good memories of the old Disney movies. I honestly think ""Tangled"" is more magical than the recent Disney fairy tale movie ""Princess and the Frog"".The new story of Rapunzel is quite clever & the songs recaptures the magic of Disney. I also liked the character development. Rapunzel is curious and adorable while Flynn Rider is an adventurous and some narcissist like attitude. The voice acting was great but the best performance goes to Donna Murphy the voice of Mother Gothel.""Tangled"" is disappointing in the trailers but if you see the movie, you could feel the magic and it brings back the childhood days of Disney. My only problem of this movie the intro and the ending is too quick. But it's fun and entertaining for the whole family. ""Tangled"" will not disappoint you.","

"TANGLED","webmaster-736-444741","18 January 2014","I considered giving this movie a 9 so that anyone looking at the rating would be less inclined to see it as from just another person who is easily pleased. Quite the contrary actually. I am almost annoyingly picky about all manner of things, including entertainment. Yet Tangled is simply a perfect 10, no way around it. So ultimately I decided to risk looking easy and give the proper score.By the way, I can only take so many animated works and in fact rejected the offer of borrowing somebody else's Red Box rental about five days ago (Planes, I think). Correction: I actually watched perhaps five minutes then shut it off. Probably not terrible. But like I said, only so much willingness to view the typical animated story.Before today, Toy Story and Shrek were both excellent in my book, yet most Disney or similar titles get skipped by me. Not knowing that Tangled fell into that category, I started watching while messing with other matters, then nearly shut 'er off in the first minute upon realizing what was unfolding, a cartoon. A couple of snappy dialog moments led me to holding on for another minute. By that time, I was in for a pound.No ""review"" other that what is written above because I really dislike being given plot details before watching a movie. The actual previews are the worst, somehow amazingly revealing the entire show in 90 seconds. Written reviews tend to be spoilers for me also, even if technically devoid of officially termed spoiler descriptions. So what you get from me is that the movie includes snappy dialogue, oh, and a few unexpected turns, plus of course likable characters and a bad guy. Take the risk.","

It's a nice, interesting story about a lost princess who escapes the tower she's been locked in by an evil witch who she thinks is her mother and finds her way to her biological family, the King and Queen. Along the way, she falls in love and makes some new friends. I like that. The song ""Mother Knows Best,"" adds to Mother Gothel's , ruthless, devious personality, and so does the reprise. I highly recommend this masterpiece to everyone who's willing to give Tangled a try.","

I saw this on a decent-sized screen in 3D, and my was I blown away by the intricacies of each frame. The hair in itself would have killed the animators. There were some scenes that made me really emotional - just because of the shear beauty in the rendering. The horrible, unoriginal, mediocre and cliché-filled trailer really persuaded me to not see this, but I decided to give it ago. It's really much more complicated than the original storyline, and there are, of course, additional characters to increase the humor and drama of it all - and I didn't mind any of that. At first I thought there was too much singing - but the songs were so well constructed that I didn't mind them either. All of the characters are charming, and the antagonist was well solidified - she is really a great symbol for realistic evils in society.OST: 9/10 Animation fluidity: 10/10 Characters: 9/10 Humor: 9/10 Family appropriate: 10/10 - especially moms.

"TANGLED","lauraberrill","26 July 2012","Hi there, I haven't wrote a review in quite a long time now, I think almost a year actually, but never mind about that, I've now decided to return to write a review on Disney's remake of the classic fairy tale ""Rapunzel"", but instead of naming the movie ""Rapunzel"" Disney decided to get a bit more creative with the title, so instead they named it: ""Tangled"". Now to start off, let me just say that this fairy tale (or princess story) Disney movie is quite different than almost all the other ones they've done for three reasons. For a start, it's in CGI rather than being hand drawn, second, like I stated earlier, they decided to get more creative with the title, so instead named ""Tangled"" instead of just ""Rapunzel"", and third, the rating's PG instead of U/G.Now this isn't a bad thing, it can actually turn out as a good thing, since it makes this move more unique than most other fairy tales Disney has done. Now, I would explain the story, but trust me, it would be way too long for me to explain it, plus I would have enough room for the whole review.So, what do I think of this animated movie? Well, if it wasn't already obvious, I freaking' love this movie, just like a lot other people do, especially Disney fans, which I am. Seriously, this is way better than the Princess and the Frog last year (in my opinion). Now, I liked that movie too, but I just find this one way better. But now for the voice actors/actresses.The heroine, Rapunzel, is voiced by Mandy Moore, which is nice. The hero, a charming thief called Flynn Rider, is voiced by Zachary Levi, he also does a good job. And of course, the main villain, an old lady (or witch, if you will), is voiced by Donna Murphy. Coolness! Other voices include Ron Perlman, M.C. Gainey, Jeffrey Tambour and Brad Garret.And now, finally, time for my final thoughts on this movie.Tangled is an amazing movie! Hands down one of the best movies of the year. Would highly recommend getting this on DVD, especially if you have kids. I still have it on DVD and I still enjoy it the same. It has excellent animation, quite a few entertaining characters especially the ""animal companions"" (Pascal, Rapunzel's pet chameleon, and Maximus, a palace stallion), the songs are all great in my eyes, and not to mention its based on a classic fairy-tale. By far, one of my favorite Disney movies ever. Oh, and BTW, don't read this if you don't wanna be spoiled, Rapunzel and Flynn both start to fall in love as the movie goes on. Well it IS a Disney movie after all. But anyways, final thoughts, this is an outstanding animated movie. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.Rating: 9/10 - or - ****1/2 out of *****Hope you enjoyed this review, which is actually my first proper review. Be sure to check in on my next review, which hopefully should be soon. But until then, see y'all later.","

"TANGLED","kdross42","9 July 2011","I was extremely skeptical about seeing this movie for the first time. At 21, I grew up with some really great Disney movies (Pocahontas, Aladdin, Mulan, Hunchback etc.) so lately all of the new releases have been coming up short of my expectations. I was especially disappointed with the Princess and the Frog movie, so I had low hopes for this movie. However, I found myself at redbox renting it none the less. And surprisingly- I LOVED it. I thought it was the perfect blend of new technology and the classic Disney feel; for once 3D-ish animation did not bother me. The storyline was great and some of the songs were very fun (When Will My Life Begin has been playing on my iPod nonstop for a few days). The heroine was a believable character with self-doubt, and the rascal-turned-hero process didn't happen too quickly like there is a tendency to do now. Also, it was nice that Rapunzel didn't fall for the guy the moment she laid eyes on him. There was plenty of well placed comedy, some of which was cliché but not overdone. I would recommend this movie for anyone to see, no matter what their age. There were a lot of good messages in it that are applicable to everyone. Kudos Disney.","

"TANGLED","Sergeant_Tibbs","3 November 2013","Although Disney will forever be immortal for their varied peaks of films since 1937, they have been struggling to stand out lately. The word Disney has become synonymous with animation and its easy for Pixar, Fox and Dreamworks to all come under the same label for kids, rather than show themselves as competitors. They thrive on franchises whereas Disney tries to keep its sequels to its straight-to-bargain bin department. These franchise films become events and although I would call Wreck-It Ralph an event movie, the average joe has no idea who made it anyway. So in retrospect, I do feel bad for overlooking Tangled as it belongs in a difficult and murky time for unique animated films, especially as it's CGI as opposed to Disney's previous landmark The Princess and the Frog. But surprisingly, it's a super charming film and it has an broadness that truly does appeal to everyone. I think it's in the sense of humour, it's very quirky and dry, reminding me of the laid-back attitude The Emperor's New Groove and Shrek. There's brilliant running gags and details sprinkled around that land immediately and make it a more involving experience.The quality in the animation was definitely worth the ballooned budget and more as they can compete with Pixar at this point. However, the storytelling is typical and overfamiliar at this point. Sure, it's Disney's style, but it's nowhere near as refreshing as Wreck-It Ralph for instance. Its biggest mistake was the songs. It could've been okay if they were unique, but they seemed like they were tagged on out of necessity. Too often do they drag the film into melodrama when it actually hits some poignant notes from time to time, but its biggest sin is that they're too plain. I also found myself wanting to know a lot more about the antagonist. She was hundreds of years old and her motivation seemed to only strike in the last twenty. There's something Walt Disney used to say which I wish the makers of Tangled took on board which is a film is only as strong as its antagonist. Sometimes it seems like the good guys will never make it as she's hot on their tails, but then it never follows through until it's hit the point it wants to show. But it's fine, the enjoyable side characters more than make up for her and in the end, Tangled wins you over. Definitely a great attempt at Disney modernising without selling their spirit.7/10","

"TANGLED","fluturoj","13 August 2016","This was so adorable. Quite enjoyable to watch and leaves you in a very good mood. The real-life lessons: Don't be afraid to go after your dreams, you'll never know what happens. This sounds quite cliché but it is so true. If Rapunzel was scared to go after the dream, if she preferred to stay where was comfortable and she thought was safe, she would have never fallen in love, seen that the world is not scared and realise that she is the lost princess. Just proves that you never know for sure what is a the best for you, it may not be what you believe and as in this case what you believe is good is actually the only bad thing in your life (Rapunzel so called mother). So courage to go after your dreams. and also a very good representation that once you have accomplished a dream, you find a another one. Just wondering after Rapunzel and Flynn Rider got each other (they were each other dreams) what will their next dream be? Another lesson is that things are not always what they seem and so don't assume the worse (even when it really looks like that). Flynn Rider did not leave with the crown as they made Rapunzel believe since it looked quite so. But then again, if things are not what they seem, the person that is being bad represented will do anything to let you know its not what it seemed (Flynn coming back to Rapunzel) (if they can of course because if he was hanged and not saved he would never be able to let Rapunzel know he did not leave her and she would for always believe that). So go after your dreams and don't assumes the worse. Plausibility: this is a fairytale talking about plausibility is not plausible (see what I did there). Character analysis: just want to say that I never knew that a course could ever be my favourite character but I just fell in love with Maximus. He was so so so adorable. Mother Gothel was a smart weak woman. She used intrigue and lies to get her way. She made Rapunzel believe that she loved her and wanted her safe so that she would agree in starting in. She did not use evilness, she just manipulated a you woman. She was lets say a modern evil woman. The leads I will not discuss since they were the perfect character with all the right values (implausible but a necessity for movies like this that have a young audience). Storytelling: I liked that the movie was not evil, Rapunzel saw the lights, the mother only intervened after. It gives you a very warm feeling it does not fill you with anger (as it would for example if Rapunzel did see the lights because of her mother). So very warm and a good watch.","

"TANGLED","DICK STEEL","27 November 2010","There's some controversy over the name change from Rapunzel to Tangled, but in Singapore we probably got the best of both worlds with Rapunzel - A Tangled Tale, highlighting that this was still in essence, a Rapunzel-Rapunzel-Let-Down-Your-Hair tale. The latest offering to add to Disney's growing list of Princess films, and thought to be the last, this 50th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series sees the Brothers Grimm's tale being given the Disney update, and that means being more child friendly, thought slapped with a PG rating rather than the usual G.The formula that Disney uses on its chosen princesses from fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm or Hans Christian Anderson amongst others, seem to come with the requisite beautiful singing voice since breaking out into song about their plight and a duet is the norm, and have this aura that birds, butterflies and bees tend to flock to, possessing this power over animals and assisted by a sidekick from the insect or animal kingdom. There's also the Prince Charming equivalent who will gallop over hills and valleys to save his beloved, before living happily ever after expected ending.In all counts, Tangled satisfied the above, though there was a moment in the finale which I thought, since it's touted as the last Princess film (though never say never with box office success) that they would go for the jugular and put a new spin on things, but I guess what's formula shouldn't be tweaked unless it's broke. Mandy Moore the singer plays Rapunzel and so automatically gives the character her singing voice as well, being captured by the evil Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) and imprisoned in a tower (well, very nicely discouraged from getting out to the big bad world out there), though yearning very much to be part of the world seen through her window, much like The Little Mermaid's Ariel. Her chameleon sidekick and palace horse Maximus, though without a voice, are likely to be the more popular Disney animal sidekicks out there with their timely antics, and if there are soft toys of them, I'm quite sure they will do pretty brisk business.But what's slightly different here is that the male lead Flynn Rider (voiced by Zachary Levi) happens to be a rogue in all sense of the word, a thief who has double-crossed the Stabbington Brothers (Ron Perlman) during a joint heist. Not a prince and hardly the gentleman to begin with, his accidental chance upon Rapunzel doesn't result in an instant love connection, but one that developed over time in their journeys to bring her out of her tower, to somewhere close enough to observe a lantern festival that happens on her birthday, where the royalty of the land commemorates the disappearance of the kingdom's princess (no prizes here of course – most of the time one party amongst the lovebirds has got to be of royal blood). I suppose the character's tapered to be slightly more realistic than the swashbuckling hero according to plan.Villains wise, Tangled's Mother Gothel is probably more simple in her motivation to keep Rapunzel's magical hair powers all for herself, an elixir for immortality, though her schemes and execution to do so are more complex and cerebral, preferring mind games and manipulation instead to get her wants, rather than magical powers and potions, being the weak old lady she actually is who's cheapskate enough not to go for botox. With no real powers nor weapons to exercise her threat, she's actually quite weak if it boils down to fisticuffs, inflicting injury from the shadows. The Stabbington Brothers also pose no threat as they are only mean looking and ultimately nothing but posers, and the flick also has in its theme to never judge a book by its cover for the dreamers it made out of a tavern full of thugs.If one were to compare the earlier Disney princesses from what has evolved over the course of time, there's no qualms about the female characters being stronger now than their predecessors. Snow White and Sleeping Beauty had unparalleled rivals in the looks department, but ultimately the docile, demure ladies don't cut it nowadays, especially when they are in comatose in their own films, especially the latter almost throughout. Today's princesses fight against bad authority, and are never flinching if the situation calls for self sacrifice. Alas they still cannot shake off emotional needs of desiring a man in their lives, so not all things are changed for happily ever afters.Still, Rapunzel is that worthy addition to the Disney stable, and I am wondering just how long it'll take before she could be found on the Disneyland grounds. Recommended for its intended demographics definitely, while accompanying adults may find that this is no longer the same as those we all grew up with.","

"TANGLED","jayleshd","14 April 2011","After seeing this movie, I felt relieved. After a string of animations, this movie was an example to all those flops of master story telling, animation and script. This movie isn't just for its target group, but for the whole family. Disney has integrated all elements of a pure and honest story. There is action, romance, mystery and all important lessons to be learnt that are of great value to everyone. The pace of the movie is perfect and the direction allows a glimpse into a fantasy world without being over the top. It keeps the viewers attention and wants you wanting more by the end of it. The main character, Rapunzel, is lovable and a strong contender of great animated characters.This movie was universal and if you want to see something that will leave you inspired and talking about to your friends - than definitely go watch this.","

"TANGLED","jeromec-2","2 June 2013","Children's movies tend to have character's that are not very dimensional -- like UP (absenting the first scene which shows how a lifetime of unexpected events often limits our dreams).The best of children's films subtly presents more interesting characters that have more that just 1 set of characteristics. Such a film was Tangled.Rapunzel is astonishing feminine when she cajoles Maximus (the horse) into accepting Flynn Rider as her protector/guide as she makes her way to the festival of the lanterns. She really turns ""it"" on. No guy could resist her combination of innocence and womanliness.My wife made mention of Flynn Rider before anything else. ""Now there is a man,"" was her brief summary of what she liked about the film. He only appeared as superficially very charming to me. Then I saw her point. He does bear a resemblance to Errol Flynn, who was not only charming, but courageous. He treated everything, good and bad, with a basic delight in life.It is the horse that is perhaps the most fun in this film. He had absolutely no dialogue whatever, but he understood everything that was said to him. He had a face that was plastic in origin and conveyed all of his responses with facial expressions. Children's films are masters of speechless communication. The Little Mermaid is almost a perfect example of this genre. So towards the end of her negotiations with him, Maximus lowers his head, flattens his ears and closes his eyes. He knows that his honour as a protector of the realm has been challenged. He knows that she is playing the damsel in distress routine and doing it very well. He knows that she is making a request he cannot refuse. He gives in, but it is certainly against his better judgement. So he shakes hands/hooves with Flynn. He has given his word and he will be obedient to that oath. But he doesn't have to like it.To emphasize the point, he and Flynn exchange shoves and punches on the bridge. They act like a couple of seven year olds. One has to be delighted by such an exchange.The last of the good guys is Pascal, the mood ring with a tail. He is, I think, a chameleon. He too is wordless, but he is not nearly as well developed as Maximus.The men at the inn look like they should be bad guys, but they are not. True, they are capable of drawing swords and maybe using them, but they all have a dream and again it is Rapunzel's innocence that they respond to. Each of them reveals in song what they dream of doing should they be free of their image. They like Rapunzel, but they are not sure of Flynn.The one really ""bad"" guy is Mother Gruthel -- wonderfully voiced by Donna Murphy. She also has the one song that is memorable (Mother Knows Best). She is all oil and false charm and an imitation of motherly love on the outside and all ooze and darkness on the inside. She is a frightening creation.So there's your cast. It's a delightful movie. You don't have to go see this with a kid as your excuse. Just go see it. It's fun for everyone.","

"TANGLED","pursuitforyou","31 August 2011","Let me preface my review by saying I watched this when it finally made its way around to my cheapo movie channel, and I didn't expect to even like this movie much less love it. The characters and acting were much more charming than I expected and funny as well. Loved the slapstick and clever humor. Then, it combined that with sweet tear jerking moments coupled with the fascination of the world that only a child can usually experience. But even for adults, the characters and story draw you into those feelings. And I was constantly amazed at the quality and sophistication of the computer animation. There are many clever aspects to this movie beyond the animation. But suffice it to say, it's a great movie worth seeing.","

"TANGLED","FlixChatter","5 April 2011","Tangled's got everything you'd expect from a fairy tale movie. Obviously you've got the Princess, the dashing Prince-like love interest, the evil motherly figure, the quirky townsfolk and of course, the expansive castle. Originally titled 'Rapunzel', it's based on the classic German fairy tale from the Brothers Grimm of a magically long-maned Princess who's locked in a tower by her wicked, selfish 'mother.' Disney apparently changed the title to be more appealing to boys who might be deterred from seeing a Princess flick. They also argued that Rapunzel isn't the only main character in the film, as Flynn Rider is also featured prominently in the film. Instead of a traditional prince, Rider is a thief on the run who stumbled upon her and inadvertently changed her world forever.Whether or not the title-switch tactic worked, this one was a real winner for Disney. It's grossed more than half a billion dollars worldwide, more than double the cost to make. Yep, 'Tangled' cost $260 million to produce, perhaps a lot of it goes to the 3D rendering, and it shows. The Wiki article mentioned that the filmmakers combined 'the best of both worlds' of CGI technology and traditional hand-drawn animation Disney's famous for and the result is impressive. This is by far one of the most picturesque and colorful animated features I've ever seen and the animation is smooth and seamless. I really was in awe of how gorgeous every scene is, with the night scene of the two main characters on a boat surrounded by lanterns. It was nothing short of magical.This Princess flick has come a long way from the classics as far as the character goes. Rapunzel is a heck of a lot more assertive and strong but never losing her naiveté and vulnerability. She's bubbly and vivacious but not dim-witted. Her interaction with Flynn from the moment they met is endearing right from the start, but it's refreshing to see that she's not immediately swooning over the guy despite he's the first one she's ever met. Flynn is the typical charming bad boy, self-seeking at first but finds his heart over time. Voiced by Mandy Moore and CHUCK's Zachary Levi, it's a lovely combination that's supported by an equally wonderful supporting cast. In fact, the two non-talking animal characters, Maximus the horse and Pascal the little chameleon are such lovable and memorable creatures, while Tony-award-winning Donna Murphy is excellent in the voice role of villainous Mother Gothel.As with any Disney's works, especially when 8-time-Oscar-winner Alan Menken is involved, the music is one of the best part of the movie. All the musical segments are lively and just pleasing to the ear, with 'I See The Light' as my absolute favorite, it was such a lovely duet. The lantern scene when the song appears is my favorite as well, yes it's on the schmaltzy side but you'd be hard pressed to deny its charm.Tangled's plot reminds me a bit of 'Little Mermaid' (a girl longing for freedom and Pascal is like the new Sebastian) and part of 'Sleeping Beauty' (she's separated from her parents all her life), but yet it's still a pretty unique story that kept me laughing and crying throughout. I also like the fact that Disney keeps this one pretty clean and wholesome, as a lot of animated features these days are filled with crude jokes and inappropriate innuendos. By the end I was totally enamored by this movie and the Blu-ray is now on its way from Amazon :) Disney still reigns when it comes to romantic animated features and this one is definitely a keeper for years to come.","

"TANGLED","Lejink","9 April 2020","An apt film, as it turned out, to watch in lockdown, this free adaptation of the old fairy tale for me is the way Disney should be going, finding fresh tales to tell from the great collections rather than remaking their classic animations of the past as real-life features.A winning combination of humour, music and animation, I rate this one of the best Pixar movies I've seen. Personally I do find the depiction of the characters slightly problematic, especially females with their massive eyes and eyelashes just making them, particularly the heroines, too cutesy. Perhaps the same could be said of the heavies whose ugly features are a bit too exaggerated too but I did like the way roguish Flynn / Eugene was shown. As for the backgrounds and individual details, these are pretty wonderful, like the depictions of grass, flowing water and of course Rapunzel's hair. Better yet is the imaginative staging of shots, some taking viewpoints we would now recognise as drone shots while others just demonstrate motion and speed in pleasing and often exhilarating ways, the best of them probably being the flying lanterns, which look like magical dolly mixtures in motion, which, trust me, is a very good thing. I enjoyed the vocal acting, the better for not being done by some megastar who doesn't need the work.The story follows the classic template for this type of film, a young heroine (or hero), striking out for personal freedom, often to right a great wrong, usually against the advice of those around them. Usually too there is at least one and here in fact two cute animal companions, some romantic interest, a lot of feel-good songs, usually by Alan Menken and of course an evil baddie to pursue and thwart the central character until all is resolved for the inevitable happy ending.Of course I appreciate that a film like this isn't aimed at the likes of me but I still enjoyed many of the gags, the songs, even if it perhaps lacks a really big number that sticks in the memory and the rollicking story. Sure some of the individual characterisations aren't too different from what we've seen before but this is definitely higher-grade Disney and a good fun movie to watch at a time like this.","

"TANGLED","jonnyfendi","11 December 2010","I have a friend who asked me, ""Is thiz movie worth watching?"" I said, ""Go and find out yourself. It is Disney , isn't it?"". Not every year, Disney introduces us to their new Princess. It is going to be a magical time of your life, get ready to be part of the history. Do you remember how wonderful is Snow White, Cinderella, Princess Aurora the Sleeping Beauty, Ariel the Little Mermaid, beautiful Belle and the Beast, Aladdin's Princess Jasmine, Pocahontas, Mulan and last year's Princess Tiana and her Frog""? It is the time! For long-haired Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) to get out from her hidden tower, to leave her ruthless mother Gothel and has some adventures along with her Prince, errr.. I mean runaway bandit, Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi). It is also for the first time, Princess Rapunzel will face unfriendly outside world, but don't worry, she's got her frying pan to protect herself and escorted by a very cool chameleon, Pascal and the white horse with dog's capability, Maximus. The song ""When Will My Life Begin"" reflects that great adventure spirit. The Directors are Nathan Greno and Byron Howard who have ever worked together in dog's tale ""Bolt"" (2008). But I think the person who deserves high appreciation for bringing thiz German fairy tale comes to live is no other than Alan Menken. Menken is the regular Disney's genius Composer who can always provide delightful classic elements into every piece of his magical music or Score. The storyline is so smooth and dynamic. Yeah it is predictable, but at least you could enjoy the joyful comedy, it is always fun to watch how Rapunzel and silly Flynn Rider tease each other. And even though without dialogue, the animal characters which are the chameleon Pascal and the horse Maximus perform successful funny slapstick. For the visual pleasure, the picture is beautifully woven to a higher level, you will be amazed by how realistic each texture and detail it has been made, the hair, the grass bit by bit. The most powerful scene is ""The Floating Lanterns Scene"", when finally Rapunzel and Flynn are in a boat right outside the castle, waiting for the glow flying lanterns to be released. In that romantic moment, you can feel the pure sincerity and so much loves between them through their innocence face expression and breathtaking interaction with the background song ""I See the Light"". That scene simply gives you goosebumps and could easily bring happy tears in your eyes. It is very rare that there is a movie that could touch my heart. Thiz one is definitely the one. Usually if someone asks me, ""Who is your favorite Disney's Princess?"". Most of the times, I would answer, ""Cinderella!"". But after thiz movie, maybe I would give a different answer. By the way, I always love the girl with the long hair ^_^ Disney certainly knows best! Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com","

"TANGLED","neenahhh","29 January 2011","And a kick-ass one, at that! Tangled is the modern version of the old fairytale classic- Rapunzel. I've forgotten what the original version of Rapunzel was, but I know that it certainly wasn't this one. Disney did a good job in making this movie. They added the plot with the hair and I loved the whole thing with the lanterns! A big plus was that all the songs were catchy! None which I can see as classics, though like ""A Whole New World"" or ""Colors of the Wind"" or etc. But they were still good. Good enough for me to want to have that album.The plot wasn't exactly A+. It was average. Not that I'm complaining since this movie's target audience ARE for the kids. I didn't hate that evil witch, by the way. I thought she did a pretty good job. I mean, she was willing to go and trek 3 days for paint that Rapunzel wanted? Most evil stepmothers wouldn't do that! (Certainly not like that bitch in Cinderella, OOPS.) But not this woman. She showed that she cared. That's why I wasn't really hoping that she would die. Halfway throughout the movie, I was even thinking of ways on how this movie could end happily, without the witch dying. ""Maybe Rapunzel's real family will let the witch work somewhere in the castle and Rapunzel would sing for her weekly!"" Hey! It seemed like a good idea to me!The humor was indeed funny. I think both adults and children would enjoy it. I loved Maximus! Max's relationship with Eugene sort of reminded me of Shrek and Donkey. I liked Maximus more, though, since he wasn't annoying. It was a good call for Disney to NOT make the animals talk this time. That gets annoying.I also liked the big hair change Rapunzel had. This movie proves that hair can really do a lot to a person. With her long blonde hair and gorgeous green eyes, Rapunzel looked like a child with no knowledge of anything. She was a child. But after her hair was cut, she looked like a new person! She looked more mature and a lot more edgy. Eugene did a good job. I teared up in the ending. What can I say? I'm a sucker for family scenes.This was a great movie. It isn't showing in the Philippines yet, but I think I'll still watch it when it hits theaters next week, even if I already got to watch it. :) Good job, Disney!1st viewing: January 29, 2011 ; 2nd viewing: February 5, 2011","

"TANGLED","tavm","2 December 2010","This was the first of two movies I watched with my movie theatre-working friend today (The other one was Faster). The trailers made me wonder if the whole thing was gonna be a little too slapstick for my tastes but having now seen it, I shouldn't have been too worried as it had an equal amount of heart, drama, action, and, yes, laughs. And knowing Disney veteran composer Alan Menken was involved with the songs-with the help of lyricist Glenn Slater-made this film even more enjoyable especially when the number of ""I've Got a Dream"" was performed by a bunch of bar customers that were considered monsters before that. Of the voice actors, I knew ""Chuck""s Zachary Levi was the leading man because of his spots during his show that publicized the movie and about Mandy Moore playing the long-haired princess from some sites but I didn't know about Brad Garrett, Jeffery Tambor, or, best surprise to me, Richard Kiel whom I've long loved for his portrayal of Jaws in both The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker (When I mentioned the last to my friend, he says he doesn't remember those movies or maybe he didn't even see them, I don't know). Anyway, that's a high recommendation for Tangled.","

"TANGLED","filipemanuelneto","30 November 2016","This film is a reinterpretation of the traditional Rapunzel tale. Far from being just a children's movie, its a film for the whole family and has space for everything: it has songs, a beautiful novel, a well written script, good action sequences, hilarious moments... Basically, is one of the most positive and innovative Disney films in years.Disney has had serious difficulties in recent years. Difficulties with his rivals (particularly Dreamworks) and some internal problems but, mainly, a kind of existential crisis where the creativity of his team was disappearing and giving us absolutely lamentable films. But this movie was a kind of turnaround, with the studio showing the public that its not yet exhausted. Returning to their own origins, which are the traditional children's tales, Disney artists sought to write a story that appealed to children and adults, and to look at the stories from a more current perspective. Thus, we can find in this film a Rapunzel that is dreamy, imaginative but not naive, shy but full of confidence and personality. After all, if the woman stopped being the weak sex and started to have a strongly active position in our society, why would not that be reflected in children's tales? It was a radical but positive change, which alters our way of seeing the story and allows us to play with it, inserting moments of action or humour.Rapunzel is on the same level as Flynn, a rogue trickster she knows and who will try to help on her trip, and whom she saves in some situations. Mother Gothel is another important character for being the villain. Her characteristics are selfishness and vanity, but she's also somewhat seductive. In certain scenes, the way she seems to use seduction to achieve what she wants is halfway between the lines. Maximus, the guards' horse, has the mannerisms of a rowdy dog ​​and the intelligence of a human being, and can be highly hilarious.The moments of action were well heeled, perfectly mixed with comical scenes without exaggeration. The jokes are intelligent, without falling into the temptation of easy laughter or being a goal in themselves. The animations and designs are excellent, with a graphic that reminds us of some of the films of Disney's golden age. The songs are good, they stay in the ear but they are far from the successes of the past.","

"TANGLED","mark-4522","11 May 2020","Tangled wasn't as big a success as Frozen perhaps because while watchable, it didn't pander to what successful Disney films engage in: Fantasy elitism. Even as the films required some sort of quest for the heroine to achieve (or preferably, a dragon for the hero to slaughter), there's a secret desire for kids to never have to grow up and earn a living. Even in this film, Rapunzel lives a pretty easy life in the tower but there are no parties and friends to marvel at her dresses and singing.What makes this film special is that the villains and heroes, even the rogue, engage in psychology we see in everyday life. The gaslighting performed by the witch should be required viewing for psychology students. The rogue who attempts to dissuade Rapunzel from her quest tries to scare her while it hilariously backfires. It's like the writers were remembering all of their childhoods.That kind of savvy commentary flies over the heads of most kids (and even many adults) but there's plenty of great music, endearing characters, and solid jokes to keep it moving but not perhaps sell as many toys or get girls excited about a life of leisure on a reality show. It's more healthy, but less addictive. The diet-Frosted Flakes of Disney entertainment.","

Rapunzel on a pink front cover doesn't convey laddish testosterone. So I reluctantly gave in and watched it...and oh boy I'm glad I did. Disney keep astonishing me with their animations, I really shouldn't be surprised anymore. A reinterpretation of the story of Rapunzel, a princess kidnapped and locked in a tower where an evil woman utilises the power of her hair to remain youthful. A nearby thief encounters the tower and is locked in a promise to guide her to the neighbouring kingdom, against the behest of her ""mother"". Tangled singled handedly put Disney's animation catalogue back on track after many lacklustre titles during the mid 00s. Incredibly easy to see why, this animation had it all. Developed memorable characters brimming with personality and harmonious voices, apparently everyone can sing in this kingdom. Ranging from royalty, thugs and peasants to a determined stallion and an expressive chameleon, this array of colourful characters breathe life into the plot. A fleshed out story dealing with dreams, internal conflict and romance. A witty screenplay boosted by sarcastic dialogue that creates plenty of smiles and laughter. Whether it be the various inaccurate wanted posters of Flynn, ""that smoulder"" or the constant requirement and usefulness of the average frying pan, it's these little details of self-awareness that enhances a basic narrative into the realms of memorability. The animation was absolutely stunning, plenty of fluid motion. The scene involving the lifting of lanterns just floored me. Beautifully crafted. The musical numbers were catchy which is all one needs for a Disney musical. Sure, the plot was predictable and the ending was far too rushed (underwhelming demise of the antagonist) but these shortfalls hardly detract from a entertaining animation that the whole family can enjoy. Well, maybe I should tackle 'Frozen' next...","

It's quirky enough for children to enjoy, but at the same time there's enough action and dialogue to allow older crowds to enjoy it as well. I loved it. The color and texture of colors were fantastic. I mean, I could honestly sit here and spoil the film for everyone, but I won't. It's definitely worth the watch, so if you have not seen it, I highly recommend it. Even for a Friday night film.

"TANGLED","KineticSeoul","29 December 2010","Now this is a very generic and predictable adventure and if you seen enough Disney movies, it's obvious the stuff in this have way too many Disney cliché going on. But the thing is, it's still a magical adventure and is still worth seeing it in 3D despite the narrow and predictable story. At first I was just going to pass on this movie, but the 260 million dollar production value got me interested. And let me tell you, this movie is just gorgeous to look at with some amazing and fluid animation. And despite the Disney cliché, it has elements that kids will most definitely enjoy and most adults will have a good time as well. All the audience in the theater seemed to have a good time watching this, so if you want to watch a movie you and your kids will enjoy I highly recommend checking this out.7.9/10","

"TANGLED","mac_canon","6 February 2011","Well this was about as good as it gets. Great story, beautifully told, great pacing, lots of funny moments and characters. Some very touching moments too. It really does have it all. Drama, romance, obstacles etc. The best film I've seen in ages. There some goodies around at the moment too. Great for all the family.I love how good Disney are at getting the audience onside with their characters. They are masters of this. Anyone with a soft spot for the good old Disney films will be well satisfied after seeing this. Great voice actors too. I take my hat off to the actors that give these characters so much life and believability. I will definitely be adding this to my Blu Ray collection. It's a gem.","

"TANGLED","movieman410","18 September 2012","There are Disney films you watch as a kid, that you watch it again as an adult several years later, it holds up and sometimes even better. I stopped pretending I ""outgrew"" Disney. I re-watched Disney films last year, starting with Hunchback of Notre Dame, which is awesome.Tangled is a little different. I was a 17 year old well into High School, so of course I wasn't going to rush to see this film. I pretty much avoided it, but two years and several positive reviews later, I could no longer avoid it. I watched it and...I LOVED IT! It doesn't matter if it came out when you were in high school, I'm 19 and in college. I saw it last night, and I loved it. I can't explain the film, don't read people's opinions, go watch it, with no word on what everyone else thought. Just watch it and see what you think for yourself, right now! I don't know why I love it but I did. Enough said. I heard it has some problems, but I ignored those flaws. My two all time favorite films; ""Lord of the Rings"" and the ""Dark Knight"" have flaws and plot holes, do I think less of them for that? Of course not! I kept an open mind for Tangled and got sucked in to this film and loved every minute of what I saw.I will definitely watch it again. If you think you ""outgrew"" Disney, watch this, and you'll change your mind. Trust me.","

"TANGLED","Benjamin_406","5 December 2010","Right after Disney's acquisition of Pixar and ""Meet the Robinsons"", Walt Disney Animation Studios were on the right track of finding its true identity, under the watchful eyes of Ed Catmull and John Lasseter. First, ""Bolt"" and ""the Princess and the Frog"" became better than ""Meet the Robinsons"", earning high level of critical acclaim. Now WDAS' 50th animated feature, ""Tangled"", is not only the best WDAS film of 2007-2010, but, too, a rare film that gets to rank among films from the Disney Renaissance - mainly, ""the Little Mermaid"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"" and ""the Lion King"".If you think I'm talking crazy about Tangled's ranks among the Fab Four, then there are things that you might want and need to notice: finding one's true identity as the main story theme, cleverly executed humor, strong and appealing personalities of the characters, immensely fantastic music and songs, infinitely superb character designs (under the supervision of Disney animator Glen Keane), emotion-stirring moments, and MOST IMPORTANTLY the reinventing of everything in the move. As a big plus, stereoscopic 3-D enhances the humor, the action, the magical moments and the tear-jerking moments of the story, most notably the lanterns in the ""I See the Light"" sequence.There's a special difference between ""the Princess and the Frog"" and ""Tangled"". TPATF emphasizes on elements of Disney tradition (princes and princesses, certain talking animal sidekicks, and toe-tapping songs) over the theme of the story, whereas ""Tangled"" emphasizes on the story's theme over the elements of the film's tradition. That qualifies the film to become an instant animated classic among ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""the Lion King"".I used to be concerned on Tangled's story structure as below the potential of Toy Story 3's story structure, but after a lot of positive reviews and ratings, I now believe that this deserves to have the insurmountable love, much like the Fab Four.","

It's not just because I thought Flynn Rider was a gorgeous animated character only, but because the movie itself was great. The storyline was great, and I prefer this over the original Rapunzel storyline. The movie got me teary a bit, but that's just me. I'm quite sensitive to movies like this. I think I've watched it six times now, and I haven't gotten tired of it. The soundtrack is great too! Different varieties of music incorporated into the movie. Probably my favorite Disney from now on. :)","

"TANGLED","fati-279","2 April 2014","I love the movie ""Tangled"". This movie sums up to: A very good work of animation with detailing. Good story line. Adventure and Romance. Love and betrayal. Comic elements and saddening truths. Songs that are melodious (I just love humming them). Magic that heals. Horse that is Amazing. Bad guys (who aren't bad) and have ambitions. Bad guys (who are bad and evil). Thief (who is HERO, the Flynn Rider (Eugene)). Lost Princess who is kept in the tower all her life. Long hair that are magical and healing, and Anti-aging. Witch that Rapunzel thinks is her mother. Dance and Music that is entertaining and enjoyable. Innocence that is in Rapunzel, and how it reflects in others. Lanterns that fills the sky on Rapunzel's birthday. All in All, a perfect movie to watch.The magic words that heal: Flower gleam and glow, Let your power shine.. Make the clock reverse, bring back what ones was mine!!! Heal what has been hurt, change the fates design.. Make the clock reverse, bring back what ones was mine!!!Song that feels: And at last I see the light. And it's like the fog has lifted. And at last I see the light. And it's like the sky is new. And it's warm and real and bright. And the world has somehow shifted. All at once everything looks different. Now that I see you.A family entertainer, one you can watch as many times you want. Because I myself have watched it like 4-5 times, and I still love it.","

"TANGLED","rgcustomer","4 January 2011","I actually didn't know anything about this film except that it was in 3D and had something to do with Rapunzel, but it had a high IMDb rating, even from old men, so I trusted you guys and I went to see it.You were right. It's an excellent film. Even if it had no story at all, it is worth seeing for the spectacular art that it is. It does have it's misfires (one small scene with water looks more like cellophane, and a spider web looks like something from a 1990s video game) but these stand out particularly because the rest of it is just so beautiful to look at. I'm fairly sure many of you will shed a tear or two, just from the beauty.Everyone will comment on the nighttime floating lantern scene, which is truly beautiful. My one concern is that with the similarity to Avatar's wood sprites, this might be becoming a cliché in 3D animated film. Of course, we could do a lot worse than to have such a good cliché.The villain in this film has a spectacular death scene. Maybe that's playing it up too much, because it's fairly simple, but the imagery is just right. I'm certain this will be remembered.The actors ... I mean the animated characters are drawn very well. But animating this close to reality is a delicate act. Some things don't work when they get too real, like exaggerated features. There are a few moments when maybe their teeth get too big and the distortion makes you a bit nauseous. Same with the eyes. You kind of wonder why they didn't just use real people. But then it falls back into place again, and it's wonderful. If you thought you might have fallen in love with one of Disney's 2D characters (come on, you know you did) wait till you see this. Flynn (why are all Disney characters recently named Flynn?) may not have the perfect body (it's a kids' show) but it's not bad, and when that face is up in yours in 3D, how can you not want to kiss it? I'm sure Rapunzel is all that too. But that's not how my boat sails.Is this the first 3D film to include a gay bar? Sure, they don't SAY the Snuggly Duckling is gay bar, but do you need them to? There are no women in it until Rapunzel shows up, and all these very butch men have these very artistic dreams. And it's the Snuggly Duckling. Good for them.Oh, and it's a musical. Or is it a movie with music? Whatever. The songs are pleasant. I enjoyed them at the time, but I can't say I remember any of them now.I saw it in 3D, but I suspect it is equally as good in 2D. For Avatar, I would say the 3D is an essential part of the film's immersive experience, whereas for Tangled, it's more of an enhancement. But they have done it right, by building it in from the start.I should say something about the story. Although based on Rapunzel, this is not the usual Rapunzel story. This version relies on magic, which if it wasn't so well done, I would normally regard as a negative. The ending is also somewhat different, but amounts to the same thing.I do suffer a twinge of guilt knowing that a quarter of a billion dollars was spent on a kids' film, instead of on, say, healthy food and education. But at least it was done well.It's a must-see film, certain to please almost anyone.","

This movie is not meant to be taken seriously, which really adds to the comedy. As kids movies go, this is one of the better ones.

"TANGLED","Zac_La_Porte","4 August 2021","Tangled certainly appears as an ordinary ""lost-princess"" tale, which would be a reason for anyone to avoid. However, it's actually an amazingly moving animation with gigantic heart and genuine excitement. For children, teens and adults, this Disney journey is a sensational experience; definitely a must-select for family movie nights.Starting off with what this film would be completely dull without, is the animation. Because it's seriously not just the beautiful, bright and adorable visuals; it's pretty much every single segment that animations use. Alongside the visually phenomenal detail, the voice performances are beyond perfect. The striking voices of Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi and Donna Murphy each perfectly fit their charming characters. Plus there's a perfect, simply perfect, selection of bright songs with appealing lyrics.Many kids will believe they're too grown up for an old Disney princess story, but any age and anyone can watch this movie. It's likely they'll finish feeling surprised at how great and fun it was. Tangled isn't a constantly-dramatic princess whining about the tower she's spent her life in; it's a positive and charming girl who is a princess without knowing it, who was kidnapped as a baby and has been raised by a strange and kind of creepy woman, Mother Gothel. The film's adventure is packed with uplifting messages, which are also improved by the voice acting. You'll undeniably adore this magical and lovely story.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","

"TANGLED","Danusha_Goska","19 December 2010","""Tangled"" is a very, very pretty movie. The lantern scene, Rapunzel's tower, the castle interior – all very nice to look at. The heroine is genuinely adorable, and the hero is really handsome. The script is sweet and funny. The songs fit their scenes. Rapunzel's animal companion, a chameleon, was adorable and different – it did not talk, except through very articulate facial expressions. The chameleon did not have supernatural knowledge; it learned along with Rapunzel.I enjoyed ""Tangled"" a lot, but the storyline didn't have the focus or power that would have made it a classic for me. I wasn't scared by Mother Gothel. The extreme exaggeration of the animation distanced me. Did Rapunzel's and Mother Gothel's eyes need to be THAT big? And what country in Europe, which is where this story originated, have such wildly exaggerated topography? Overall, though, this film is better than most. It's just that I did like it so much I wanted it to be a classic.","

"TANGLED","LeonardKniffel","4 May 2020","This Disney creation features the magically long-haired Rapunzel, who has spent her life in a tower but is about to discover the world-and herself. The strong ""prince"" character is not a prince at all, and Rapunzel, while a princess, is more independent that many early Disney princesses. This story is likely to appeal to boys as well as girls. ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013","

"TANGLED","threedbomb","9 January 2011","This review won't really be useful to many people as I come at this film as an animation student. There have been precious few 2D or 3D animated productions that cam capture your heart and mind. We have the giants like Spirited away and Grave of the Fireflies in the 2D world and really anything from Pixar except Cars to love. Precious few others. Ice Age nailed it but most Dreamworks productions fail to capture the sheer brilliance that can be a character in motion. Despicable Me is another that just brought the characters to life and here with Tangled, we have that same excellence in character animation. Every character from the adorable chameleon to the angry horse are characters you'll love, not because of the story but simply because of the level of animation at play here.There's an extra level of realism in this movie that you don't normally see too. There are moments during the movie where a characters face isn't seen and you lose sight of the fact it's just stylized 3D animation. The water scenes are particularly stand out brilliant cinematic moments with incredible realism. These scenes must have been globally illuminated to death. I dare not guess how long these frames must have taken to render.But just like any special effects heavy movie, without a great story and equally great performance, you'll soon tire of it. Tangled doesn't disappoint there. The story is great fun, inventive and very much a wild spin on a very old fairytale. The performances from the real voice actors are devilishly good. It's surprising there weren't more BIG names doing the voices but satisfying to know that this really doesn't matter. The actors aren't phoning in these lines, they are nuanced, operatic and multi layered really helping give the animated characters much more depth.For me it's the tiny moments that make the movie, not just the great slapstick moments but the way the characters emote. Rapunzel isn't sure of a new character entering the scene? Sure she has that look of trepidation and fear but the emoting is so dynamic and rich that you can almost see the characters thinking their emotions through from moment to moment. It's quite intense and I found myself a number of times being drawn towards the screen, feeling what Rapunzel was feeling. Almost mirroring the emotions as you might do with while talking to a great friend or partner.So as I said at the beginning, this review probably not going to be so good for the average viewer wanting to find out whether to take the kids to see this but if you appreciate animation as an art form or even appreciate the technical skill involved in animation as pure entertainment. You must see this, you must go and see it again and then you must buy it, download it or otherwise get your hands on this and have it in your collection for happily, ever, after.","

Romance out there - like watching ""Titanic"" for the first time, as a catharsis - a scene of incredible beauty, when the sky lifted hundreds of paper lanterns ... Breath catches in delight and touching fragility of this moment, and as the sun touches the heart.And if you have not touched this Sunbeam - do not miss by far the best cartoon of the year.

Tangled is an excellent movie, with a deeply touching plot and the most wonderful music (well OK, it's not amazing but still very good) and characters that bring life to the once known as boring fairytale Rapunzel. SouthSideChgo-Disney puts twists in every story! That's why people like it! You should appreciate their creativity! Personally I love the contrast between low-life thief and high-flying princess-it simply shows its not your position that decides your love and personality! I really love Flynn's charming personality and Rapunzel's tough-chic yet sweet style of doing things. Pascal and Maximus are two of the most amusing animal characters I have ever seen. The animation is smooth and gives a real fresh feeling for such an old tale. The original songs are entertaining. It's literally flawless! Tangled certainly beats any other animated Disney movie-a fresh, fun twist on a old, almost gloomy tale. Well done Disney!","

The humour was well done, and some of it subtle for the adults.My daughter laughed out loud at the wardrobe gag (watch and you'll know which part I'm typing about), & the interplay between the horse and Flynn.My wife and I enjoyed the story and the comedy was done that it enhanced the story. It didn't seem that this was a case of throw thousands of sight gags, one liners and set pieces and see if any stick.Now it's a Disney movie so you know Happy Ever After is pretty much guaranteed, but it's a fun journey to get there!

Hope you will make more nice animated movies as soon as possible.I would recommend this movie to anyone with any range of age without hesitate. Everything at this movie is just-great. Feels we are in that location and we are a character of that movie.My rating 10/10 (If I could give 100+/10 I would do it too) Best Animated film at all time ! Thank you for all","

I even laughed many times throughout. The romance between Rapunzel and Flynn is beautiful and makes them my favorite Disney couple. I see the light has to be one of the best Disney scenes in history. Speaking of music, it's fantastic! There are even action scenes that are so intense!One of the best Disney films to ever exist!","

"TANGLED","anaahnu","19 October 2016","The story of a young woman, escapistic and romantic (well, would you expect something else from a girl who was sixteen years locked in a tower?) She quickly gets to the real world, discovers how unpleasant and dirty it is, but in some way ""infects"" the brutal robbers with her naive, blonde and ruddy optimism. There are also conflicts with other not-so- pleasant people (the Horse, and Mother Gothel, of course), but in the end, all that Shrek-like mockery becomes a parody of itself. It does, though, merge very well with romance and all that mi-mi-mi stuff. So, the film is recommended to be seen both to the viewers who like spiteful twists over traditional fairy tales, and to the ones who just like a good bedtime story. You'll not be disappointed.And -- Aw for that old man with angelic wings: he's the most fascinating robber ever!","

"TANGLED","SquigglyCrunch","24 November 2016","Tangled follows a woman named Rapunzel who is raised in a tower all her life but one day meets a man called Flynn Rider whom she recruits to take her outside the tower. Quickly I wanted to appreciate this title. I never really thought about it, but it is pretty clever. After having long hair I can relate to it and sympathize with Rapunzel so much more. If having hair only down to my neck gets tangled, I can't imagine her trouble. The characters are a lot of fun to watch interact with each other or indulge in their own thoughts. Since Rapunzel spends some time alone in the tower, that aspect has to have some focus. She's a super fun character in the movie, and she works really well with Flynn's character, who is also a lot of fun. He's one of the only sane characters in the movie, but he's still kind of insane, so he fit in just fine. These characters were all pretty well-fleshed out and thus, I felt the feels fairly often. In particular I felt tears twice in this movie, even though this was the third time I'd seen it (but the most recent). The comedy works really well. It fits the movie, and is often situational, so it flows really well. While it isn't an incredibly funny movie, it at least doesn't try to force jokes into the story. It takes them as they come. But the humor wasn't the only thing that made me smile. This is such a fun movie, and I found a smile to be very present throughout it. The soundtrack is a lot of fun too. The songs aren't gratuitous or overdone, and often serve the purpose of driving the plot or developing a certain aspect of the story, all the while poking fun at itself, specifically in the form of Flynn Rider's character. Plus Disney just got good voices to sing the songs. Unfortunately, sometimes it was a little too obvious that the character's voice actors weren't always singing the songs, but that was only on one occasion. There was one thing I didn't notice the first couple times I saw this movie, but Disney dares to dip it's foot into the waters of maturity. Without spoilers, it briefly deals with the idea of unhealthy, potentially abusive relationships. It's done mostly through imagery, and isn't blatant, but I definitely noticed it, and I kind of respected it more for that. Plus it just fit the movie as a whole. If I have but one flaw with this movie, it's the method of Rapunzel's big realization at the end. It makes sense, sure, but it's still a little far fetched. As for the ending itself, it's pretty generic in terms of these kinds of movies, but it's still amusing. Overall Tangled is a heartfelt, fun movie. The soundtrack is fun, the characters are fun and engaging, and the movie strikes up genuine feelings. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie.","

"TANGLED","Robert_duder","28 March 2011","Like any child I loved Disney films and I turned into an adult that adores the classic Disney films and hope to share them with my children one day. But could they keep creating the classic films we all know and love from Snow White and Bambi to modern day classics like Aladdin and Beauty and The Beast? Well the answer is absolutely!! Tangled is the first Disney animation film I have seen in quite some time and I was glued to my screen the whole time. Funny, cute, romantic, thrilling, adventurous, edge of your seat, and stunningly beautifully animated and this only begins to describe Tangled. I saw elements of Aladdin, Beauty and The Beast, and even The Lion King in the style, story and characters the film makers created. Like many Disney films it draws on a classic fairy tale and brings those characters to life in such a larger than life way. I saw Tangled on Blu Ray which certainly helps the quality but throughout the film I couldn't stop being awestruck over the quality of the animation. I believe it is traditional hand drawn animation but just...wow...from Rapunzel's doll like features, to the breath taking Kingdom they live in. Kids will adore it and adults will never take their eyes off of it.Zachary Levi is already high up on my hero list as I am a huge Chuck fan and recognized his voice immediately. But regardless of this his voice talents to the egotistical, romantic thief Flynn Rider is just perfect. As much of a fan of his that I am I forgot about him and he simply became Flynn Rider to me and that says a lot. Mandy Moore seems to have slipped out of the spotlight lately. But she comes back strong as the naive, lovely, young girl Rapunzel with the magnificent hair. I wasn't sure about her voice at first but she is perfect and their voices come together to create a terrific chemistry opposite each other. Donna Murphy plays the voice of the obligatory 'witch' or evil 'step mother' as the case may be. Murphy is a terrific character actor and has been for years and she is perfect behind the face of Rapunzel's captor. And of course any great Disney film needs a handful of talented supporting voices and they include Ron Perlman, M.C. Gainey, Jeffrey Tambor, and Brad Garrett to name a few of the more well known and noticeable performances.Only Disney can create characters like this. Other film making companies make good animation but does anyone even touch these guys? This film packs so much adventure into one movie just like you'd expect and demand from a Disney flick. There has to be a 'but' since I didn't score it a perfect ten and that 'but' happens to be something that is also a Disney staple and that is the music. I didn't think the music in Tangled was very impressive at all. The best song was the song in the tavern with all the brutes because it was fun and light hearted but none of the songs stayed with me or stuck in my head and I am certain there won't really be any songs that become classics. So its unfortunate that the music stumbles but everything else about this amazing film makes up for it. Constant adventure!! Boys, girls, men and women will find something they love about it. There are some definite dark turns in the film especially near the end where our hero Flynn is stabbed...so be warned with the really little ones but otherwise Disney swings and knocks another one way, way way out of the park. I LOVE IT!! 9/10","

"TANGLED","MLDinTN","29 August 2011","Even though I'm not a kid, I thought this movie was good. Much better than what I've seen lately. It had good animation and a worthwhile story that's a little different than the usual Rapunzel tale. Here an old woman finds a flower than makes her eternally young. The king's men find the flower and use it to save the sick queen whom is having a daughter. The daughter is born with golden hair that has magical powers. The old woman steal's the girl and keeps her hidden in a tower, where Rapunzel grows very long hair and the woman uses it to stay young.On her 18th birthday, Rapunzel wants to leave the tower to see the sky filled with lights. A thief, Flynn, finds the tower and sneaks in. In some very cute scenes with a frying pan, Rapunzel gets Flynn to take her to see the lights in person. Once the old woman finds her gone, she starts to track the 2. So, Rapunzel finds all that she's been missing in the world and well you guessed it, learns her mother was keeping her hid for her own selfish reasons.Along the way, there are cute scenes and a couple of good songs. But most important, it's just a good story that makes sense.FINAL VERDICT: A cute animated movie. Check it out.","

"TANGLED","inkblot11","19 December 2011","Princess Rapunzel (Mandi Moore) has been locked up in a tower since she was a baby. That's because Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) stole her away from her royal parents shortly after her birth. Why did she do so? Because a magic flower that restores youth was given to the pregnant queen, since she was gravely ill, and Rapunzel's hair now has that magic, with the help of a special song. The young lady's only companions are her ""adopted"" mother and a darling little chameleon, Pascal. However, through the tower's windows, Rapunzel has seen that lanterns are launched on and only on her birthday. A coincidence, maybe? Perhaps. In any case, the Princess wants to go outside the Tower for her 18th birthday present. But, Mother Gothel won't hear of it. She sings a song about the perils of the world, from poison ivy to quicksand, and tells her daughter NEVER to ask such a thing again. Disappointed, Rapunzel tries not to cry. The next day, when MG leaves to gather dinner fixings, Rapunzel is surprised to find a young man, Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) has scaled the Tower's wall to evade the Palace Guards. Flynn, you see, has stolen a crown, and is in trouble. Never having seen a man before, Rapunzel manages to knock him out with a pan and lock him in the closet. Thinking quickly, when Mother returns, the Princess sends MG away on a hunt for white dye, a three day journey. Its Rapunzel's plan to ask Flynn to show her the lanterns and, indeed, the world. It begins well. Mother leaves, Flynn helps the Princess down and the vacation starts. But, all too soon, MG returns, surmises what has happened, and is hot on her daughter's trail. Of course, she is not alone, as more men are chasing Flynn, too. Time after time, the duo is in peril. Will they escape and will Rapunzel learn who she truly is? This outstanding film is so adorable that every viewer will, in turn, sing out its glories to the next potential fan. Moore, Levi, and Murphy are terrific in their important roles and they can warble like the most melodic of birds. The supporting cast is fine, too, as is the animation, script and direction. As for the music, it is so exquisite that a special Nobel prize should be created for Menken, the composer. He is one rare earth commodity and he is ours, an American. (The lyrics are also quite nice). In short, untangle your feet from the couch cushions and go get Tangled at once. What a treasure it is!","

"TANGLED","paul_haakonsen","2 March 2011","""Tangled"" is an instant classic. It is right up there with the likes as ""Mega Mind"" and ""How to Train Your Dragon"".The story told in ""Tangled"" is the classic tale of Rapunzel locked away in the tower, and we all know that one, don't we. But ""Tangled"" is more than just another re-telling of the classic tale.The animations and drawing style in the movie is really nice, and I liked it right away. Lots of vibrant colors and beautiful details in every single scene. And that is something that works well.And the characters in ""Tangled"" were lovable, even the villains. Everyone was colorful, interesting and brought their own unique touch to the story and the movie. From the animals to the people, everyone was just fabulous. I especially liked the chameleon and the horse, they were really hilarious and had really fun poses and faces.The voice acting in ""Tangled"" was quite nice as well, and they had a bunch of good names on the list.""Tangled"" is definitely a movie that should be in every movie aficionado's collection. The movie is the type of movie that you can watch over and over again, proving that Disney still can make instant classics.If you haven't seen ""Tangled"" already, get in gear, and watch it. It is truly a spectacular animated movie with a lovable story and even more lovable characters.","

"TANGLED","aesgaard41","3 April 2013","What can I say about ""Tangled"" that has not been said before about every other Disney movie before it. Like every fairy tale before it, liberties were taken with the original tale to expand it into a movie, the animation is breath taking, the actors and characters are excellent and it has its own morality tale behind it as usual. The songs are memorable but not as infectious as anything from say ""Aladdin"" or ""The Little Mermaid"" and much like Ariel and Jasmine, Rapunzel has a certain buried sexuality about her when she's not bouncing around like a Disney Channel pop star on soda and candy bars. The characterizations and mannerisms are fun to watch of course; at times, you forget these are animated characters. You can really see the efforts the animators made to have these characters move, react and respond like living people. The best parts mostly surround the character of Rider with the horse Maximilian and how Rapunzel reacts with her color-changing chameleon. I watched the movie because I like to see how far the animation is coming, and Rapunzel's ridiculous long tresses look perfect, but the story itself is just as much fun to watch.","

"TANGLED","jboothmillard","6 February 2011","When I read that Disney were going to make a new film about Rapunzel, I assumed it was going be hand-drawn animation, but it turned out to be computer animated, but I was still going to see it. Basically a magic raindrop falls to the ground and creates a new magical flower that can heal injuries, cure the sick and prolong youth, the elderly Gothel (Spider-Man 2's Donna Murphy) wants this flower herself to give her everlasting youth and beauty. But the flower is taken by the kingdom palace guards looking for a cure for the sick and dying pregnant queen, and after being cured by the flower's magic, she gives birth to the baby girl, Rapunzel, who absorbs the flower's abilities in her golden hair. Finding this out, Gothel kidnaps the baby in order to use the powers of her hair for herself, and she takes her to a hidden tall tower that is well hidden and no-one will ever find to raise her as her own daughter. Eighteen years later, Rapunzel (A Walk to Remember's Mandy Moore) has grown her hair to a humongous length, and she still believes the horrible Gothel is her mother, and with the insistence of her mother stays trapped in the tower to spend her time singing, painting, reading, and looking out the window wondering what is outside. She finally plucks up the courage to ask her ""mother"" about the lights she sees rising in the sky every year on her birthday, she doesn't know they are floating lanterns released from her real home at the palace, hoping she will one day return home. Of course Gothel strictly forbids Rapunzel from leaving tower being greedy for the power of the hair, but soon enough when she is alone, dashing thief Flynn Rider (Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel's Zachary Levi) climbs the tower to hide. Desperate to see the rising lights up close, and with her ""mother"" gone for three days, she makes a deal with Flynn that if he takes her to where the lights come from, she will give back the priceless crown he has stolen. So begins a treacherous journey to the kingdom, Rapunzel has mixed feelings about disobeying her ""mother"" and leaving the tower, but she knows she has dreamt of leaving for years, and Flynn is very wary for his sake as well, being a wanted man. When she returns to the tower, and gets back up via the secret entrance, Gothel sees that Rapunzel has been taken away, she at first believes she has been kidnapped, but then she spots her ""daughter"" singing about her relief to be out. After so many chases towards the kingdom, the two thieves that were originally with Flynn join Gothel to capture both him and Rapunzel, they do manage to get to a boat and see the floating lanterns, and they are getting very close as well. Rapunzel is fooled however into thinking that Flynn does indeed still want to crown, he is tied up and captured ready for execution (by hanging), and she is taken back to the hidden tower believing her ""mother"" was right all along. But Flynn manages to escape, and rides back on once rival now friend horse Maximus, while Rapunzel finally realises that she is princess to the king and queen, and of course that Gothel kidnapped her for her hair's abilities. In the end, when Flynn is near death he cuts Rapunzel's hair, turning it brown and taking away its power, Gothel falls from the tower to her death, Rapunzel saves Flynn from death with the flower abilities in her tears, and she returns to her true home to marry Flynn. Also starring Ron Perlman as Stabbington Brother, Jeffrey Tambor as Big Nose Thug, M.C. Gainey as Captain of the Guard, Brad Garrett as Hook Hand Thug, Paul F. Tompkins as Short Thug and Richard Kiel as Vladimir. The voice talent are all great, including of course singing their own songs, Gothel is a particularly nasty villain who enjoys it, and the animation is fantastic, especially if you see it in 3D. The most spellbinding sequence is all the floating lanterns surrounding the couple falling in love with the beautiful Oscar and Golden Globe nominated song ""I See the Light"", it is a family film that shows fairy tales are still possible to make, an enchanting animated comedy adventure. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Film. Very good!","

"TANGLED","Doylenf","31 March 2011","TANGLED is much more than ""a drop of golden sun."" It has a flippant, modern attitude in all of the dialog, a crisply appealing and smartly styled animated technique that brings the characters to life, and a pleasant score by Alan Menken that captures the essence of the fairy tale story in street smart style. In short, it's an instant classic for today's movie fans.With talented voice chores performed by ZACHARY LEVI, MANDY MOORE and DONNA MURPHY, the characters are given full-bodied images that are uncannily real. In fact, the chemistry between Flynn Rider (Levi) and Rapunzel (Moore) is a gradual thing (not instant falling in love as in most Disney features), and blends and ripens convincingly for the tender moments that follow.And aside from the key human characters and a horse named Maximus, there's plenty of fast-moving adventure as the evil Mother Gothel plans on keeping Rapunzel at her side forever as a way to retain the magic powers of her golden hair, lest she shrivel away to an old hag. And within the texture of the plot is always a sense of humor from either one-liner wisecracks or the animated expressions of the humans and Maximus, the stubborn horse.Easily one of the best animated features to come out of the Disney studio in some time despite the fact that the score is not as strong as other animated classics. Nevertheless, it has action and romance and an astounding beauty in its magnificent settings and polished art work.Absolutely a must for any animation fan.","

"TANGLED","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","24 June 2011","Rapunzel doesn't remember her royal parents(why is it that ""destiny"" is always a big, positive one?), as she has been locked away in a tower since infancy, trapped there by a witch(who has a habit of disappearing using her cloak, I guess she doubles as a ninja) who pretends to be her mother so she can remain young, using the girl's magical hair and its healing properties(nevermind its ridiculous strength or the changing back and forth between her roots feeling any pain from pull or not). She does wonder about the outside world(albeit she does know things that one wouldn't think she would, given that she's been indoctrinated against leaving), and when Flynn, a young arrogant thief, hides in her place of residence, she forces him to take her outside. There are more details, but that's the gist of it. I haven't watched much of anything by Disney since Hercules, especially since they went from 2D into CGI, and I see little has changed since my last dip in the pool. Don't get me wrong, this does look pretty good. Nice use of brightness/darkness of color, some memorable designs and the general animation is great. I can't comment on the acting, as the cut I viewed was dubbed into Danish. Anyway, the material is ""safe"". Over the top stuff, silliness, and in general mostly for the kids. I saw most punchlines coming, and this garnered one or two chuckles out of me, nothing more. The plot developments aren't that unexpected, either. We have a horse that acts like a dog(a bloodhound, to be exact), a chameleon as the sidekick(...I don't know, I guess they're just drawing them out of a big hat with ""animals"" written on the side) even though they hadn't thought of very many gags where that comes into play(even fewer that are at least decent... and you could excise it from the script, with nothing changing by it), and a sweetened take on an old fairy tale that had merit on its own, and will henceforth be known in the mainstream by the sanitized, corporate-approved version. With all that said, the pacing is quite reasonable, and this goes into compelling themes(and explores them rather well), such as the fear of age/death, growing up and youth rebellion. Like I said, par for the course. Not better or worse than the general piece by the studio. There is a little mild violence in this. I recommend this to fans of the work and legacy of ol' Walt, and/or of the original story. 7/10","

She is just so damm likable. She is funny, awkward, qirky and very interesting. I find the prince and side characters pretty decent as well. The villan is actually not bad, all thoufg not the best. Rewatching it again, I stilk enjoyed it, but not as much as the first time round. This is dinsey's first CGI princess tale. I must admit that I do mish the 2D animation of princess films and Princess and the Frog tried ro bring 2D back, but wasn't sucessful in doing so. I must admit that I did enjoy the 3D animation of this film,particularly Rapunzul's hair. It was very fluid when her hair moved very nice. But the only issue's I found was that the pacing did slow down at times in the middle of the film, resulting in it being a tad boring. But my gosh, the story is just too good. I do recommned this film. I think both boys and giels will enjoy it equally. 😁👍🏾","

She was a princess who had been confined in the tower in the deep forest for 18 years because of her magical hair. I liked this distance between nature and civilization, I meant the kingdom. It made me feel like I saw a different world. I feel wonder and dream because there are undeveloped regions like ""Princess Mononoke.""I was fascinated by unique and cute characters she met on the way. One of them was a one-armed pianist and another was a strange pantomime actor. I really like these playfulness of Disney. My favourite was a big man loves unicorns. I was surprised at the physical ability of Maximus, a horse chased around Eugene, the theif, with insistence.An action scene in the canyon was intence and worth seeing! I wondered how the location setting was. It looked too clean and tidy though. Was it based on Grand Canyon or any mountain dams?","

"TANGLED","Byrdz","3 February 2016","Yes ! You read that correctly ! If for nothing else, watch this one to see THE HORSE !!!! His name is MAXIMUS. He is a very large white horse with attitude. He moves like a dog and he seems to think like a dog as well. He snuffs along the trail of the hero.. At one point he even sits on his haunches and when that sweet spot under his chin is scratched, he starts to kick himself with a hind leg. Found him IRRESISTIBLE !!! He and the hero have a brief Wile-E- Coyote / Roadrunner encounter on a tree branch. SUPER ! Oh, Tangled also has a very appealing Lost-Kidnapped Princess as Heroine and a delightful smoldering (his word) thief turned hero. The hero's gang of miss-fit-thief pals is supercalifragilistically amusing. There is a good ensemble song as well. Almost forgot the Villainess (hissss booooo). She looks a lot like Cher and sings up a storm like a Broadway Diva. Again... TERRIFIC ! Disney required mascot, Pascal (a chameleon) this time around is rather over-shadowed in appeal by Maximus. Remember him ?. He just turns colors and makes hand movements that aren't really clear as he only has two fingers and little hands.The animation is incredibly well done. There is a frying pan (with a large part in the proceedings)that looks as it it is really there and mighty even be a real frying pan. All the marks and dimples are just right. the scenery and special effects are also ""just right"".There is a trio of little girls who have their day made when a lady with 70 feet of shining golden hair enters their city.Little ""bits"" abound in this wonderful and rather neglected film from the Disney Company ... their 50th Animated offering and for me, one of their best.","

"TANGLED","JohnDeSando","24 November 2010","Flynn Rider: ""You smell that? It's part man-smell, and the other part is really bad man-smell, but overall it just smells like the color brown. Your thoughts?"" Tangled is not the Rapunzel story your mom grew up on. As the above quote attests, Disney has post-modernized it with updated, semi-hip dialogue and some Freudian notions that fit the story's thematic base. Disney has made a fun movie of an old fairy-tale chestnut, not as complex as Princess and the Frog, but good enough to be the studio's 50th animation and going strong.How does 26 years old Mandy Moore's voice sound like 18-year old's? It does, and I'm impressed with the whole angle of vision that emphasizes the needs of pre-teens and teens to bolt from the nest and see the world as it is, not through parents' eyes, while promoting the value of family, real family that is.Supposedly the visual style, an effective use of 3D, has the properties of ""The Swing,"" a romantic painting by Jean-Honore Fragonard. Whatever, the hair of the two leads, and even wicked ""mom,"" is textured and layered in a most realistic,yet romantically stylized fashion.Disney is canny enough to use Rapunzel's hair as a weapon, similar to Indiana Jones's whip, to take the staid glam out of its tradition and make it useful for more than a ladder. Even the sidekick chameleon, to be almost as welcomed as Donkey in Shreck, has reactions reflecting the modern cynicism rather than the cute simpleton.In its further favor, the love between the two teens is not in the Twilight longing motif—it rather it grows organically from a mutual respect, not lust divorced from the idealized bodies Disney distractingly offers in its animations. In short, your thinking youngsters should love the ironies Tangled offers while it entertains with patented Disney humanity.","

"TANGLED","ForTheMostPart1999","7 November 2022","Probably the best princess-themed movie I've ever seen. Disney Animation Studios never fails to disappoint with pretty much any their movies. I've always loved the childhood classics such as The Lion King and I still love those movies today, especially ones by Disney themselves. As for this movie, it had a very neat story of Rapunzel and her insanely long hair. Some fun witty moments throughout the film and even some neat action scenes as well. Nice and detailed characters as well. The animators especially did a good job with Rapunzel. Overall, the 3D animation was extremely detailed (also hearing that it was the most expensive 3D animated film). Flynn Rider was also a fun and funny character and one of my favorites in the movie. The rest of the characters were all pretty unique. Great heartwarming songs and music as well. Very touching and, once again, a great classic. Let's also not forget that this is Disney Animation's 50th film.","

"TANGLED","antec84","10 April 2011","Being a 26 year old male that usually finds action/scifi type movies more preferable, I did not expect that I would end up liking this film. My dad set up a 3d projector system at home and we've been struggling to find good 3d content, so as a last effort a week ago we purchased Tangled 3D. After watching the film at length, I was pleasantly entertained. A lot of animated children's' films seem rather cheesy to me, but this one was different. I would have to say that the film excelled in character development, and that was what set it apart from many others. The characters have memorable personalities that draw you in, and overall the film evokes a dynamic range of emotional sensationalism from comical, to happy, to sad. At its conclusion, it leaves you with a feel-good type of movie-watching experience. Altogether, the textures and the 3D looked gorgeous on our home 3D system. Overall, definitely a film worth having. You will not be disappointed.Thats it for my 2 cents worth.","

"TANGLED","3xHCCH","19 January 2011","""Tangled"" is Disney's latest film, but unusually it is not a highly hyped as previous Disney films, at least where I live. I did not really like the nondescript generic title, which does not say anything much about the movie at all or even hint at its creator, Disney. Upon watching the movie, we see a spin on the fairy tale of Rapunzel. Rapunzel becomes a princess here, in the Disney tradition. The male protagonist is played by a charming (again in the Disney tradition) outlaw Flynn Ryder. The elements of the Rapunzel story are all there: the long hair, the locking up in the tower, the teardrop at the end... But Disney gives these things a very interesting magical back story (again in true Disney form). To make the boys come and see the movie, they include an exciting and funny action story with Flynn Ryder character, complete with thugs and chases.I personally like the non-speaking animal characters a lot -- the cute little chameleon Pascal and the mighty royal steed Maximus. I never did like those other noisy annoying sidekicks in previous films too much. The songs are not too memorable unfortunately. They tend to sound alike already, don't they? The action can tend to be a little graphic here, meaning there are lacerations and stabbing with blood, and you actually see what happens to the witch when she falls out of the tower -- unprecedented stuff. It is in fact the first Disney princess film to get a PG rating.It is a marked improvement over ""Princess and the Frog"", Disney's last film. It is not to the level of ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Little Mermaid"" and ""Mulan"", but ""Tangled"" is a landmark film in Disney history, as they finally enter into 3D CG animation territory. The effect of this animation vastly improves the quality of action scenes (like the breaking of the dam) and the magical effect of the poignant scenes (like the floating paper lanterns). This film is well worth its price of admission. It is fun, funny, exciting, romantic and touching, everything you will be looking for in a Disney animated feature film.","

"TANGLED","ShelbyTMItchell","11 January 2011","A take on the Rapanzel tale. If you read fairy tales as a child. You see that, the prince rescues the damsel in distress. Well this girl acts anything BUT one.Rapanzel, the main protagonist, voiced by Mandy Moore who also sings. Is locked away in the castle by her ""mom,"" named Gothel, who is the main antagonist. Who is longing to see the outside world despite warnings from her ""mom"" that, the world is cruel and full of cruel people. She wants her daughter to believe. But that isn't the real reason why, as you will see.Of course, it wouldn't be Rapanze without her long hair. Which has magical powers. That helps to heal people, among other things. For also her hair helps Gothel be young and vibrant! She stays in the tower for eighteen years and on her eighteenth birthday, she asks to venture out but again, to nobody's surprise, she is yet denied.Meanwhile a thief, who takes the name of Flynn Rider but that isn't his real name. As you will see what his real name is and how he took that nickname if you see the movie. Steals a tiara from the castle, among many other things he has stolen from the castle. BTW, the castle also plays a huge part in the movie. Not just while he steals things.The thief(voiced by Chuck's Zachary Levi), comes across the tower where Rapanzel has been for all of her life. Climbs up there as a place to hide. Only to be knocked out and tied. Rapanzel makes a deal with him. To show her the outside world, and she will give him back the tiara. Untying him, he reluctantly agrees.Despite feeling guilt, but feeling free she has now seen the outside world. She and Flynn enter a tavern despite some trouble from some rough thugs, some were trapped allowing Flynn to escape along his many misadventures. And seek revenge on him for the things that he has done against them, like going back on his promises to helping them. In order to help himself escape.But her singer and jubilant attitude calms the mood and people down. But low and behold, Gothel is after her. After finding out she isn't at her tower. And with the help from the two thugs that were with Flynn over the tiara. And want revenge on him.Meanwhile, the two begin to know one another. And of course, fall in love. But those hindrances could break them up. Will Rapanzel and Flynn's love friendship and love stay true and keep them together? Or will Gothel's secret about needing Rapanze's hair, along with the castle trying to capture Flynn. Plus, possibly having ties to Rapanzel possibly, keep them apart.It is a good movie. Very cute. As well as a good love story. With wit and charm. It has a twist to it. Not like the original Rapanzel story you have come to know and love. But you will love it!","

"TANGLED","joliefille411","2 January 2011","Tangled is above all else a masterpiece of animation and background. I'd never say another thing about cg again if there was a hope that even a quarter of the stuff churned out looked so stunning. It could have been a much worse film in other aspects and I would still be drooling.Which makes it even better that it doesn't suck as much as the trailers imply. I have no explanation to offer for the crap job done on the marketing other than everyone other than the artists are a bunch of greedy bastards. Anywho, it's a charming story, not nearly as snarky and Shrek-ish as I had feared, filled with some excellent characters. Mother Gothel is an excellent villain, combining charm and evil marvelously. And as for the titularly tangled couple, both are serviceably great in a not-too-terribly-bland way. Maybe a little too quippy for their own good, but oh man, they boast some of the most attractive character design I have ever seen. There seems to be a lot of lifting from anime, with the huge saucer eyes and heart-shaped faces. The voicework was in many cases good, better than I was expecting to say the least. Donna Murphy was, of course, great and I like Zachary Levi well enough from his role as Chuck, but Mandy Moore was the sleeper hit. Frankly, all she had to do was not suck it up and I would have been floored. I still would have liked to see Kristen Chenoweth in the role, but Moore's voice definitely had a stronger note of sincerity and thankfully the nasally pop-tartness was for the most part absent in her singing.And the songs! Actually, I am afraid to admit I cannot remember a single tune from the show, which I just saw this afternoon. I remember them as pleasant enough at the time and know I liked Mother Knows Best quite well, but they just didn't stick with me. Instead I've been humming True Love's Kiss all evening, being in the spirit of the movie while infinitely more catchy.So all in all, Tangled was a worthy placeholder in the coveted 50th feature spot. If it had any faults, which were few, they can all be forgiven by the sheer beauty of the artistry, which really is the whole point anyways. At least if you ask me.","

"TANGLED","tieman64","15 March 2012","""The one thing that the public dislike is novelty. Any attempt to extend the subject-matter of art is extremely distasteful to the public; and yet the vitality and progress of art depends largely upon the continual extension of subject-matter. The public dislike novelty because they are afraid of it. It represents to them a mode of Individualism, an assertion on the part of the artist that he selects his own subject, and treats it as he chooses."" - Oscar Wilde ""Believe in the character. Animate with sincerity."" - Glen Keane As Pixar becomes evil, Dreamworks and Disney's animated features seem to get better. ""Tangled"", based on the German fairy tale ""Rapunzel"", is perhaps the studio's best animated film since ""Bolt"", though both are still far too manic, the products of a popular culture that has been reduced to an Eternal Now, where noisy, shallow entertainments constantly give way to replacements that are only superficially distinguishable from their predecessors. Disney, and all of modern culture, works hard to create an audience that values artificial newness and not much more.This kind of creepy replication is at the heart of ""Tangled"", a film which sees a cute princess, Rapunzel, kept in a constant limbo so that an evil witch may be rejuvenated over and over and over again. Rapunzel and her handsome prince's willingness to stick to formula, to remain frozen in character, is what enriches the witch, her body growing like some kind of bulbous, perpetually expanding Disney bank account. It's only when Rapunzel and her man break away from their roles – she transforms from hermit to princess, he from bandit to prince (itself formula) – that the cycle is destroyed.The plot's mostly junk, but aesthetically this is an exquisite, gorgeous looking film. The man responsible for this is master animator Glen Keane, who has little to no prior experience with computer animation. The result is that ""Tangled"" uses no motion capturing and has a visual style that hearkens back to Disney classics of yesteryear. Disliking the ""sharp"", ""straight"" look of computer animation, Keane issued a mandate for soft, round edges, organic looking movements, and warm hand drawings whose lines and colours resemble that of traditional oil paintings on canvas. Beyond this, the film treat us to richly rendered forests, super expressive characters, an eye-popping colour palette, whispery light effects, and sexy greens, pinks, blues and whites. The film's character animations are themselves very good, particular an odd horse that behaves like a bloodhound, moves like a laser beam and seems designed to mimic the upper body of a chess piece. The human characters are a delight too; visually it's a good film.""Tangled"" was the first Disney fairy-tale since ""Beauty and the Beast"", which was released way back in 1991. Since those straight faced, earlier Disney films, Disney has slipped into the grip of post-modernity. It's princes and princesses now know that they're ""princes"" and ""princesses "", constantly indulging in sarcastic, ironic, pop-culture referencing winks. Thankfully ""Tangled"" does go too overboard with this, and when it does the gags and jokes mostly work well, as do some of its parody's of modern Broadway tunes. And as with most computer animated films, the virtual camera work here is super fine-tuned, everything ultra choreographed, which lends both the film's action sequences and exposition a special visual kick. All this comes at a cost: 260 million dollars for this baby, roughly three times higher than your average Pixar budget.This being Disney, the film is overtly sexual, with phallic towers, sexually manipulative women, fertile valleys, wide eyed couples and strong, sexual currents. And as with most modern Disney films, which get increasingly self-referential (""Bolt"" was itself rife with films within films), there's an unintentional meta-plot going on, our animators' love aligned to Rapunzel's love of 2d drawing, of art, which escapes its prison and bursts into a 3d fantasy world of criss crossing spatial axes. Incidentally, Disney's previous ""princess film"" was ""The Princess and the Frog"", an offencive little Obama-era film about a ""black princess"". In comparison, ""Tangled"" is hyper white. Like brushing your teeth with bleach while the KKK eats mayonnaise on your lawn. Only whiter.8/10 – Worth two viewings.","

"TANGLED","bendy392","7 June 2014","Disney's 50th full length animated feature. And with it, they decided to head back to what Disney did best: a fairy tale. This one being based off of the story of Rapunzel. You know, the girl with the God knows how much feet of hair? Yeah, that's the one. Also, this is Disney's first time of putting 2D animation to 3D. If you can tell, the designs of the characters look like they're from 2D. I mean, Rapunzel DOES look a bit like Ariel, doesn't she? Anyway, let's jump into the story.Once upon a time, there was magic flower that a witch, named Mother Gothel, has been using for centuries to keep herself youthful. Eventually, a kingdom grew and the queen falls ill one day while pregnant. The King's men then find the flower and use it to heal the queen, who then gives birth to a girl, named Rapunzel, who possesses the magic within her golden hair. Gothel realizes that Rapunzel is now her only way to stay young forever and breaks into the castle, kidnaps her and takes her to a tower in the middle of a wilderness, where nobody will find them. Gothel convinces Rapunzel to continue to grow her hair otherwise it'll lose its power. Rapunzel then notices that every year on her birthday, she sees lanterns flying in the sky, which are actually launched by the kingdom so that one day, the lost princess will find her way home. Rapunzel wants to leave the tower and see them, but Mother Gothel constantly forbids her from leaving—that is, until a thief named Flynn Rider, breaks in and Rapunzel convinces him to take her to see the lanterns. From there, it's a grand adventure with colorful characters, comedy and of course—romance.This story is GENIUS and the characters are so memorable. Rapunzel is very likable. She's smart, funny, adventurous and has a real kind heart. Everyone she meets likes her, including a bunch of ruffians and a mad horse. Also, I think she is one of the best female characters ever created. I mean, yeah, she has her insecure Disney Princess moments, but later near the climax, she stands up to Mother Gothel, who emotionally abused her for so many years, and she SCOLDS her when she learns who she really is. So yeah, I think she's a well written character. Flynn Rider is also likable. Most of the time, he's played for laughs, but aside from being a snarky ladies' man, he has his development. Throughout their adventure, he starts to have feelings for Rapunzel and hell, he ends up saving the day at the end. Also the romance is good. Yeah, it's a typical Disney-not-even-a-week-later-romance, but in the end, you don't really care. In fact, they don't even get married. At the end, he PROPOSES to her. Even the comedy is hilarious. There's a horse named Max, who comically plays the ""Captain Ahab"" character, who is obsessed with hunting Flynn. Whenever you see him and Flynn together, it's just hilarious.How's the music? While I DON'T think it's the best soundtrack from Disney, it has a beautiful score ""I See the Light"" and I think it's one of Alan Menken's finest work. Even when its playing, the animation is glorious when you see the floating lanterns. And speaking of the animation, another brilliant moment is when you see Rapunzel's parents, who never say a word in this movie, but when they're crying, it's REALLY powerful. You can see the pain in their eyes like they're about to give up on the search for their daughter.The villain, Mother Gothel, is also a great character. She's cunning and manipulative like pretending to be Rapunzel's mother, but she can also snap at anytime, asserting her psychological abusive relationship with Rapunzel. And at times, she can actually be pretty funny. But aside from that, she can get pretty dark, like when she straight up STABS SOMEONE IN THE BACK. Yeah, blood and everything. How often do Disney villains stab someone in the back?!So is this movie ENTIRELY flawless? WellI only have two problems with this movie. Flynn Rider's real name is revealed to be Eugene Fitzherbert. Honestly, I don't see a point in him having an alias. When we were introduced to this character, we fell in love with Flynn Rider, not Eugene. In popular media, he's known as Flynn Rider. Hell, people remember him as Flynn Rider. I guess you could argue that him confessing his real name was a sign that he's growing more feelings for Rapunzel, but then again, that's kinda a nitpick. My other problem is the marketing. For example, look at the trailer. The one where it ONLY showed the comedy. That didn't look like a Disney film, it looked like a crappy romantic comedy made from Dreamworks. I'm sad to say I fell for this at first and I didn't bother seeing Tangled until years later and— heh, wasn't that a mistake. Plus, this movie didn't become number 1 at the box office until its SECOND WEEK. The marketing also didn't really say much about the return to the classic Princess fairy tale, they only showed the comedy relief and Flynn Rider being a smartass and that was about it. If the marketing for it was to say that it's one of Disney's finest since ""The Lion King"" or ""Beauty & the Beast"", people would be more willing to see it. I wish that this movie got more attention than most others, but it does have quite an audience. Most say that this movie is far from the films that were made in the Renaissance era, which really shocks me because this one is SO good. The characters are great, the story is great, the villain is great, it's really a gem. I've sat down and watched it numerous times and when it comes again, I will gladly watch it from beginning to end.","

"TANGLED","jwv-823-79715","10 January 2014","As the film starts, so will I start by saying that I really like the frame narrative. Everybody will be able to connect with it because of its reminiscence with bed-time stories, and it neatly ties the beginning and the ending together.Throughout the film, there's a great momentum of action, singing and character building. The film succeeds in portraying likable, believable and funny characters that, although they may be cliché-esque types, do convince. The dialogues too may make you suffer from a certain feeling of déjà-vu, but they are witty, and the songs are enjoyable (props to Mandy Moore), with the usual accompanying trademark funny scenes. The voice-acting is top-notch, as are the sound-effects and the soundtrack, which provides just the right tune for just the right occasion. Going on about aesthetics, the animations were colourful and enchanting with jaw-dropping detail (which makes for an awful lot of beautiful screenshots for fans).The story is no big mystery or surprise, even for those who are not familiar with the fairytale itself. The film however, does a great job of keeping it interesting with several sub-plots and an occasional plot-twist. It is the story about the confrontation between a naive teenager and the world, and also about the adolescent's growing awareness for the other sex. Tangled is a great example of the genius, albeit quite clichéd Disney formula of success on its best. We recognize the story of a sympathetic protagonist searching for freedom, and exploring the world. He or she encounters several evil characters on the journey, but in the end wins out over them, not only because of his or her intelligence and perseverance, but also by charming others with their innocence, likability and lack of prejudice.This mix of elements forms the basis of the trademark Disney formula, with which Disney here proves they utterly ace the art of pleasing a mass audience, all age categories included.","

This movie proved me wrong.However, it could very well have been my hesitation and low expectations that led me to enjoy it so much that first time. That does not explain the absolute love I have for this movie in my multiple rewatchings of it.On the surface, it could be your basic movie. However, it's when you think about it, that's when it snares you. The villain in this movie is so much more frightening because I can relate to the dynamic between her and Rapunzel. The subtle abuse (and it is abuse, even if it is emotional) just chills me to the bone.This is also the first Disney Princess Movie I can recall (Mulan notwithstanding) where it was not all about the love story. The love story wasn't secondary, but it worked well in tandem with the story that ran parallel with it. (Plus, I'm a huge sucker for stories where the love evolves, almost as I adore Unrequited Love.)There are so many points I can make about this movie. If I sat here and listed them all, I could probably have it published.One note, though. While Maximus was awesome, Pascal got on my nerves to no end at first. Over time, he's grown on me.","

Let's not even get to those straight-to-video sequels and spin-offs (of which only a tiny few were likable). This is Disney's first major CGI movie. The success of it may set a new trend for future Disney films as a result of which I'll miss the beautiful hand-drawn works that contributed in making classics of so many of their older films.However, the animation in 'Tangled' is first rate and definitely up their with Pixar. The enchanting fairy tale world looks colourful and magical. The details and movements are very well done. The story is told in a very Disney fashion with added tongue-in-cheek humour and the occasional songs. The songs contribute well to the story-telling and the jokes work effectively. There are a few plot holes but given that it's based on a fairy tail (Rapunzel) these things can easily be overlooked. The voice acting is very good. Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi are adequate as the typical Disney princess and Disney hero. However, Donna Murphy steals the show as the evil Mother Gothel and the supporting cast is great. Brad Garrett's Hook-hand thug is hilarious.My favourite character was Rapunzel's chameleon sidekick who provides some excellent subtle comic relief and Max, the horse.

That is until, the rakish rogue Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) lands on her doorstep.Blackmailing Flynn into escorting her to the palace, Rapunzel gets her first taste of the outside world, and all its perils.By modernizing the character, her powers, and her purpose, Tangled takes the famed fable beyond its lofty confines, while adhering to standard Disney song and dance.Although, I do hope that Rapunzel's carpet doesn't match her drapes.

"TANGLED","johnnyboyz","9 December 2011","Disney's latest is a feast for the senses in as much one cannot deny its colour; exuberance; 'crack on with it' attitude and generally fun, frantic nature - but this is all it is in regards to that age-old ""feast for the senses"" line, as I cannot say I felt a genuine nor heartfelt taking to it like I can to some of their other works and nor can I muster a reaction along the lines of being particularly moved. The film is sassy and effervescent, a film in the Disney mould of its depicting the adventures of a young, often socially starved by her father/mother, heroine getting caught up in all sorts of plots and pratfalls with a range of oddball folk along the lines of Aladdin; Pocahontas and The Little Mermaid resulting in change and great adventure. The film follows that of the Mandy Moore voiced Rapunzel, a young girl who lives with her mother and steadily approaches her eighteenth birthday. Only, she doesn't actually live with her mother but a faux-incarnation of a mothering figure – the dastardly Gothel (Murhpy), who begins the film as a haggard elderly lady before finding a magical flower enabling her to become young and stay young. In order to do so, she must constantly harnesses the power which comes about to be imbued within that of the infant Rapunzel's hair, a catch which is brought about when Rapunzel's REAL mother harnesses the life from the flower herself so as to keep her alive during childbirth. With Moore's character possessing a sort of trichological Holy Grail, and having been stolen away from her true parents, of whom look suspiciously like the king and queen out of 1959's Sleeping Beauty, she finds herself locked away in a tower by herself at the bereft of the person she presumes to be her true guardian.The heroine on this occasion isn't the best of young female leads that the American animated movie making corporation have ever come up with. Cut from a stone more akin to that of a recent, Disney-mass produced 'conveyor belt' generation of young women along the lines of Hannah Montana and Selena Gomez, Rapunzel is a po-faced; ""Best. Day. Ever!"" quipping poster child incarnation more broadly representative of this and is disappointing in this light. She is, however, ridiculously talented in an array of fields which range from astronomy (perhaps at a time before most astronomers did what they did?) to dress-making; her burgeoning young adulthood cranking things up a gear when she desires to step outside of the proverbial bubble, much to Gothel's disdain when she realises the magic she possesses will go with her.In essence, we have a film about a young girl wanting to grow up coming up against an elderly woman wanting to grow down – that is to say stay young. Said dynamic brings about the film's best song, ""mother knows best"", in a sort of verbal psychoanalytical orgy of why young Rapunzel should stay locked in the tower with her pet chameleon rather than get out and explore as she approaches adulthood like she wants to. Unfortunately, and on a much more detrimental note, we have had the likes of Black Swan released in 2011; the 'sordid' mother-daughter relationship here paling in comparison to Aronofsky's forcing drama with the whole thing, of which plays such an important role in the piece overall, landing at our feet more damply than what would have been away from exposure to said piece.Respite in Rapunzel's world arrives with that of Flynn Rider (Levi), a cocksure young thief who's a lot more handsome than his two criminal cohorts and manages to steal some valuables from a castle and get away again before having the gall to double cross his partners in crime and make off. Flynn stumbles upon Repunzel's little hideaway in amidst the hills and forests and renders it his own to lie low – and that's when all the trouble starts. The sub-plot to do with the kingdom's chase, eventually led by a cross pollination between a horse and a bloodhound named Maximus, whose clothing sticks true to his name and sees him decked out in Roman Centurion-esque garb, to get the valuables back and Flynn's own double crossed friends chasing him down does well to intermingle with the central tract of Rapunzel's coming of age story and what eventually transpires on that strand.We enjoy Rider and Repunzel's coming together extending beyond that of the tower's domain, something which kicks off an adventure similar to that of when Princess Jasmine and Aladdin first met and came to bond – the gimmick here seeing neither of them know of the other one's true-to-life foundations in royalty. I like the fact that her aforementioned trusty pet chameleon, Pascal, is mute; thus, I make it, rendering Tangled the first Disney film since that of Pocahontas to encompass creatures of the animal world whom do not speak. Where we might have had a hair-brained, fast-talking animal sidekick doing whatever, Pascal cuts a silent and often cheeky looking figure – a character who's all hand gestures and facial expressions, a character built on comedy of a more physical nature and making him infinitely funnier than a what might have been. The film, branded proudly by that of Disney themselves, is their fiftieth; if the run were a so-far indelible cricket innings by that of an individual batsmen, then Tangled is the nick along the ground for four runs through the slip cauldron thus proudly bringing up the half-century and enabling the player to raise his bat more than it is the imperious cover drive to seal a landmark. That said, the film comes with a buoyant energy; a charming love story and a fun chase narrative on top of a fair few laughs that compensate for a few lacklustre songs – it is worth a go.","

"TANGLED","SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","14 December 2011","Reading some of the reviews for this you may expect the start of a new wave of Disney brilliance. What I saw was Disney playing it safer than they have ever done before. Everything is the same, but worse. Worst of all are the songs. I pick up songs very fast. I can hear a song once and hum diddly hum it weeks later. The songs from Tangled are about as memorable as, well, if I could remember something so unmemorable it would kind of undermine my point. The film also has the least threatening of all Disney villains. With none of the menace nor charm as some of the classics, Mother Grothel is just someone you don't like, rather than fear and despise. The humour is immature and wreaks of 90's post-modernism. This same kind of narration was used in Happily N'Ever After, and there's a reason you haven't seen that film. Even the story itself is stretched and involves a bunch of lifeless characters that are overshadowed by a chameleon and a horse. The animation is fine, the voice work admirable, but this is a hollow and bland film.","

"TANGLED","nicole-m1994","9 April 2013","Seeing all of these reviews posted by adults about how boring or lack-luster this movie is is ridiculous. It is meant for little girls to watch, and I think it succeeded. My niece absolutely loves this movie, as I'm sure many other little girls do. I can honestly say that I love this movie as well. I think it is a cute movie, and sure it has it's cliché moments, but then again, how many movies are completely 100% original? Do some research and you'll find that almost every movie follows the exact same pattern.As for some reviews about the body image issue, I believe this movie does more help for girls. At the end when she cute her hair and it turns brown she id STILL looked at as beautiful an officially regains the princess title with her short brown hair. I personally believe that should strengthen a little girl's self conscious. As for people complaining about graphics and the ""unrealistic nature"" it is a kids movie. It is called a cartoon for a reason..and that isn't because it is supposed to look like a real human. The scenery looks pretty real to me, as well as some of the character feature, and although the proportions may be off it still catches peoples' attention.Overall I love this movie and seriously cannot understand why so many adults are critiquing it so harshly when it is primarily made for kids! I know my niece loves it and its such an awesome feeling to cuddle up with her on occasion and watch a movie that we both enjoy so much.","

"TANGLED","Mr-Fusion","18 February 2015","As recent Disney movies go, ""Tangled"" is largely forgettable stuff. It looks like your typical CGI kids movie, and there's not a lot to these characters or the story.But my kid loves it, so they must be doing something right. She usually gets a kick out of Flynn Rider's antics - particularly the ""smoldering"" scene and when he gets a frying pan over the head and stashed in a wardrobe. Which brings us to the movie's real charm: Zachary Levi, who makes Rider a likable guy and infuses this movie with much-needed personality. The guy's just plain charming, and his contribution to this movie cannot be understated.5/10","

"TANGLED","Movie_Muse_Reviews","28 April 2011","It seems to have taken until the eleventh hour, but Disney has finally found a way to make its classic fairytale stories work in the 21st Century. Thanks to longtime Disney animator Glen Keane (serving as producer) and directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard (""Bolt""), the film stays true to Disney's long line of rich fairytale history while adding a distinct layer of action, adventure and humor that modern audiences now require.2009′s ""The Princess and the Frog"" marked a complete return to traditional animation for Disney and received much praise, but the film continued the trend of moderate and unsatisfactory box-office success for fairy tales. All hope seemed to be pinned on ""Tangled"" to revive the genre or it would surely hit Disney's back burner indefinitely. Once titled ""Rapunzel,"" Disney's strategy for this film was clear: appeal to a wider audience. Zachary Levi's character Flynn Rider, a sharp but self-absorbed thief, became a focal point of the marketing, and while this is Rapunzel's (Mandy Moore) story, he does play a more prominent role than a large segment of Disney princes from over the years. In short, ""Tangled"" appeals to boys, girls and the whole family.Disney has never been known for defying stereotypes, so in that sense, the complexity of Rapunzel and Flynn should be a lauded accomplishment. Like most princesses (or so it seems) Rapunzel is a naive dreamer who sings about longing to see the outside world from her tower, but she's quick with a frying pan (as a weapon, not cooking utensil) and her hair possesses a surprising amount of dexterity. It's rather unrealistic how well she handles the outside world considering her overprotective and narcissistic mother (Donna Murphy) has bred incredible fear in her, but she's by far the most 21st Century princess to date. As for Flynn, despite the cockiness, deception and excessive charm, he has a down-to-earth dry wit too that makes up for his over-the-top nature.The story carries a surprising amount of intensity and emotional pull. With Mother Gothel and the two thug twins in pursuit of Rapunzel and Flynn as they venture to the kingdom so Rapunzel can see the ""floating lights"" that come out every year on her birthday, there's no shying away from dark elements. The possessive mother motif always works to make you sick inside and considering Rapunzel's sweet nature, you really do wish ill on Mother Gothel.In terms of the animation, ""Tangled"" feels traditional, but it's a good thing. Keane has worked on countless of the Disney classics of the '90s and he finds a way to adapt that style while using computers. The result is that familiar richness and magic of a hand-drawn animated film with the photorealism and attention to detail of CGI. With big round eyes, all the characters earn our sympathy quickly and make ""Tangled"" as enchanting as it is action- packed and exciting.As Disney has always done with exceptional skill, the non-verbal but human-like animal characters vastly increase the humor of the film. Paschal the chameleon and Maximus the royal steed both have unpredictable dispositions that make them fun and lovable. As a chameleon, Paschal likes to instigate conflict but quickly recoils and turns the shade of objects around him when he's nervous. Maximus takes it upon himself to track down Flynn with a sense of self-importance, yet he's a sucker for normal animal pleasures like being pet and apples. The brilliance of these characters never fails and will always be part of the Disney legacy.So sigh relief if you're a Disney fairytale fan, because ""Tangled"" has finally found the answer. Some die-hards will insist on more memorable songs and musical numbers (even with a couple of excellent Alan Menken tunes, especially ""I See the Light""), but the trade off (as seen with a ""PG"" rating for the film as opposed to all previous fairy tales earning a ""G"") is something more compelling for all audiences.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com","

"TANGLED","rrrrox","28 April 2011","This movie is just brilliant! I'm not going to say anything about the plot or the characters in particular, just that they are perfectly created! They are so easy to like, the dialog is really smart and funny, the songs are very nice and they stick with you even after the movie has ended.It's a movie any age can enjoy because it makes you laugh, feel joy and hope and it makes you smile, but it also keeps you in suspense and wondering what happens next. Like I said before, the dialog is very and I mean very funny, and I recommend everyone to pay attention to the facial expressions of the characters which are simply hilarious!! Ever since I was a kid (I'm 23 now), Beauty and the Beast has been my all time favourite animation movie! It still is but I have to say that Tangled is pretty close in taking its place, and it's definitely the best/funniest/smartest animated movie I've seen in the last 5-10 years!Definitely watch this movie, no matter what your age or gender is, there's no way you won't enjoy it! I'd give it a 20 out of 10 if it were possible!!P.S: As if the story, the dialog and the video weren't enough to make this movie so wonderful, the cast is also perfect! The voices suit the characters so well that I can't imagine other actors doing them! Thumbs up for the chosen cast!","

So when I went to the cinema with my mum to see it, I went in with a mixture of hope, excitement and dread. The lights went down, the movie started and an hour and a half later, I waltzed out of the cinema in a blaze of happiness, because I knew that for the 50th time in 73 years, Disney had produced an animated masterpiece. The music and songs, composed by Alan Menken, are as good as any from the Renaissance. The plot, while originally being rather ""Grimm"", is slightly altered in this movie but still true to the story in essentials. The movie, all in all, is a balanced blend of action, comedy and romance and I loved it.","

"TANGLED","jfgibson73","24 April 2011","This is probably the best animated film since Finding Nemo, and I would say the best Disney movie since Aladdin. They really hit it out of the park with this one. It'a simple story, but the characters make it lots of fun to watch. Of course, the animation is incredible, both in how detailed and appealing, but also the style of design. I especially like the storybook settings like the Snuggly Duckling and the streets of the kingdom. The songs are fine, although I don't see the soundtrack as being one of the strong points. Rapunzel and Flynn are the main reason to watch, and supporting characters like Maximus and Mother Gothel add a lot as well. As a villain, Mother Gothel is one of the more complicated Disney characters; she's clearly evil, but at the same time, acts as a mother for Rapunzel. When the movie was over, I had some confusion about her motivations, which makes me wonder if younger viewers will be clear about her either.","

"TANGLED","Buddy-51","1 August 2011","The 50th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, ""Tangled"" is a little less flashy and a little less hectic than the average animated feature these days, hewing closer to ""reality"" than most such films – if one can stretch that term to include a tale of a beautiful, tower-dwelling princess whose blonde tresses glow when she sings, and whose ""Prince Charming"" comes in the form of a roguish thief whose face is plastered on wanted posters all over the countryside. But ""Tangled"" doesn't overplay its hand in the storytelling arena. There are no fire-breathing dragons, no talking animals, no over-extended action sequences (or at least no more than necessary). The focus is mainly on two attractive and likable characters coming to know and accept one another throughout the course of their adventures.The adventure begins when Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), who has just turned eighteen, decides she wants to leave the castle in which she's been locked away by an old crone posing as her mother - it turns out Rapunzel's hair confers eternal youth on anyone who touches it - in order to experience what life is like in the outside world. Rapunzel finally gets her wish when the thief, Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) - who's fleeing the law and the two cohorts he's just betrayed - attempts to hide in her tower, which he assumes is empty. However, he gets more than he bargained for when he meets this naïve but feisty young woman who sees him as the opportunity for escape she's been pining for all these years. So off they go to see the world, with many an unexpected adventure awaiting them along the way.""Tangled"" is a little more deliberately paced than the typical kids' flick – indeed it takes a full half-hour before we even get outside the tower room – and the scenes run a little longer than usual, as Rapunzel and Flynn take the time to establish a relationship of mutual respect and trust. The humor is gentle and the tone sweet, yet there is just the right amount of starch in the characters of the crone (nicely voiced by Donna Murphy) and Flynn's aggrieved criminal cohorts to keep things from getting too sappy. The soft-focus backgrounds provide an appropriately comfy setting for the tale, and the musical numbers (by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater) have an appealing Broadway show-tune brassiness to them that lifts the audience's spirits.As written by Dan Fogelman and directed by Nathan Greno and Byron Howard, ""Tangled"" doesn't come sailing out of the wings, as so many similar recent films have done, trying to impress us with its postmodern revisionism and cynical self-awareness. It tweaks some of the elements of the classic Fairy Tale genre to be sure, but it also acknowledges and respects those elements. It really isn't in the business of tearing things down just so it can congratulate itself on its own iconoclasm and irreverence. And I, for one, am tremendously grateful for that.","

"TANGLED","estebangonzalez10","31 January 2011","¨Superhuman good looks, I've always had them. Born with it. But superhuman strength, can you imagine the possibilities of this?¨ Tangled was a pleasant surprise and it reminded me a lot of the fairy tales I read during my childhood years. This is actually Disney's first CGI fairytale film and it was brought to us from the creators of Bolt and Meet the Robinsons (Nathan Greno and Byron Howard). The movie began a bit slow for my taste, but midway through it picked up and completely hooked me until the very end. There are several scenes which reminded me a lot of Disney's early movies such as Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and The Little Mermaid. The main characters aren't really the stars of the film; it's the secondary characters like Maximus- the horse, and Pascal- the chameleon who steal the show. They were the ones who got the most laughs out of the audience, but Rapunzel and Flynn did make a great couple and were very likable characters nonetheless. There are also a couple of scenes were a small man dressed only in diapers shows up drunk, and he is hilarious every few seconds he appears on screen. Disney took a huge risk at trying to go back to the classical fairytale stories, but it absolutely worked. The story was amazing and had several emotional moments along with very funny scenes that the entire family could enjoy. The CGI effects also gave the story a more magical feeling to it, and the lantern lighting scene was just breathtaking.As for the plot goes we are introduced to Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) who was born with magical healing and aging powers in her hair. The only problem is that if she cuts her hair those powers vanish (which explains why her hair is so long). She was born a princess, but due to her healing powers she was kidnapped by an old lady named Gothel (Donna Murphy), who locked her up in a tower so no one would ever find her. Gothel raises her as her child and Rapunzel grows up believing she is her daughter and thinking that the outside world is a dangerous place. Her only friend is a chameleon named Pascal with whom she spends the entire day locked up in her tower. One day a wanted man named Flynn (Zachary Levi) shows up accidentally in her tower while trying to hide from the castle guards who are searching for him because he has stolen the crown. Rapunzel knocks Flynn down with a frying pan and takes the crown from him. When Flynn wakes up Rapunzel realizes he is not as dangerous as her mother has told her men were, and she decides to make a deal with him. If he takes her to the castle to see the lantern lightings which are released every year on her birthday she will give him the crown back and let him go. Flynn realizes this will be a hard task since he is a wanted man, but it is his only opportunity so he takes it. Together they begin their journey, but the only problem is that everyone is after Flynn, including a guard's horse named Maximus, who is more committed to his mission on catching Flynn than anyone else.I actually watched this movie in Spanish (Rapunzel and Flynn were voiced by Chayanne and Danna Paola) and the translation was really well done as in all Disney films. The story is really well written and has several funny moments along with some emotional ones as well so Tangled is well balanced. The main reason I think this fairytale worked for both genres is that it doesn't only focus on the princess. This time the main characters are both Flynn and Rapunzel and they both get a lot of screen time. Flynn, despite being a thief, is a likable guy and has a good heart, while Rapunzel is the usual innocent girl who is being taken advantage of. As I mentioned before the secondary characters also are one of the main reasons why this film worked so well. Tangled is one of the best animated films of this year (after Toy Story 3 of course) and is well worth your time. I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did and didn't even like the trailer that much, but it really surprised me. I absolutely recommend this film for the entire family. The story is really well written and the dialogue in this film is hilarious.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/","

"TANGLED","purplegeekfreak","23 April 2016",". . . a horse? Disney's Tangled, directed by Nathan Greno and Bryon Howard, is charming, fun, and humorous, the perfect balance of marvelous music, appealing adventure, and ravishing romance. As the movie opens up, it starts with Mr. Dreamboat a.k.a. Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi), who narrates our tale and I must say, those ""Hot Guy"" focus groups Disney put together were a great idea. The focus group was a sudden gathering of all the women in the studio where they brought in pictures of the most attractive men they could find because Disney wanted Flynn to be the most handsome male lead that they have ever had and they succeeded. I mean, Flynn Rider is a hilarious hunk, especially for a bandit! This stunning thief tells the tale of the flower that came from the sun with its magical healing powers and about the old hag (Donna Murphy) who covets it before it's found and taken to the sickly queen, pregnant with Rapunzel (played with enlightening enthusiasm by Mandy Moore). After she is born, Mother Gothel snatches the princess out of her crib to lock her in a tower just so the horrid witch can use the rejuvenating powers Rapunzel's hair now holds. And that's all because once the hair is cut, it loses it's power and turns a nice shade of chestnut brown. This is where the magic really happens because the animation is so stunning! Her hair glows with the same brightness as the flower and with a snip, the glow delicately fades away. Not to mention the fact that Disney gives an actual explanation of why her hair is infinitely long because why should the only use for her hair be a rope?Years later, Rapunzel is singing about chores and crafts and when the heck is she going to be able to finally get out of the house, almost like a regular eighteen-year-old. But often singing. Moore blows us away with her brilliant vocals, singing ""When Will My Life Begin?"", for it's the day before Rapunzel's birthday and she has just one wish; to see the floating lights. We learn, later, these are actually lanterns sent out by the king and queen anticipating their daughter's return home. But Rapunzel's wish is declined by her ""mother"". Everyone saw that coming. What we didn't see coming, though, was after Mother Gothel cautions Rapunzel with a scintillating song ""Mother Knows Best"" and leaves the scene, the attractive criminal who comes along to scale the tower and hide for his life from the palace guards bringing the stolen crown with him. The stolen crown that just so happens to belong to Rapunzel! Here is where we find Disney putting it's own magical twist on this fairytale. Now we are seeing two main characters and Flynn Rider isn't even a prince like in the original Rapunzel story which is, really, kind of refreshing and it certainly holds my attention. Moreover, Flynn Rider is totally awesome for boys to connect with because he's sarcastic and humorous so while Rapunzel is singing about her feelings, Flynn Rider is cracking jokes everyone can enjoy. Disney certainly knows what it's doing. As the story continues, Rapunzel is frightened by this strange man in her prison like home so she uses her trusty frying pan to knock poor Flynn Rider out and stuff him in her closet until she can let Gothel know of her accomplishment. However, when Mother Gothel becomes infuriated with Rapunzel's constant plea to leave, Rapunzel decides to ask for paint as a birthday gift and begrudgingly brushes off the subject so Gothel leaves on a three-day journey for paint. With that, our golden-haired princess convinces Flynn Rider to be her guide to see the floating lanterns. In an attempt to scare Rapunzel back to her tower, Flynn takes her to ""The Snuggly Duckling,"" a pub filled with ruffians and thugs where they recognize Flynn Rider as the wanted thief and fight over him for the prize money. However, Rapunzel surprises everyone by standing up to these bullies and demands that they give her guide back, crying out to them that Flynn is the one she needs to take her to see the floating lanterns, her precious, lifelong dream which leads to another brilliant song involving all of the chummy ruffians who apparently have a soft spot for dreams and the friendly thugs help the lovable couple escape the royal army.Rapunzel and Flynn finally make it to safety. The adventure continues from there, including an exquisite last song, a hair-raising ending and in the company of Maximus, the stallion who acts more like a dog than an actual horse, provides comic relief and entertainment while interacting with Flynn Rider. Disney's Tangled is a lovely tear jerker and a captivating movie for boys, girls and horses of all ages. Another dazzling movie from Disney, as expected.","

"TANGLED","duncannoella","22 September 2023","I've been wanting to watch more Disney movies lately and I came across rapunzel and I know that I'm really late only watching it now but I was kind of suprised like I didn't expect it to be this good. I loved the story even though I kind of already knew what it was about it still got me engaged and it was gripping. I really loved the songs some I already knew but didn't know they were from this film so I was suprised. Loved particularly ""see the light"" it might be my favourite Disney song and the animation in that scene is so beautiful. Anyways, overall loved the film and I recommend it to everyone.","

"TANGLED","colinrgeorge","1 December 2010","This is what you get for not seeing ""The Princess and the Frog."" Disney eschewed its revitalization of traditional animation for this forgettable CG adaptation of Rapunzel, which goes by the nondescript nom de plume: ""Tangled.""If the recent announcement that the animation giant is placing a moratorium on fairy tale films should come as a surprise to anyone, their position on the matter is telegraphed plainly into the first five minutes of their latest and last: modern audiences won't sit for straight- faced fantasy. The name-change alone underscores the corporation's feelings on the commercial viability of a tradition it once held proud.That willful dissolution of magic is a slap in the face to ""Snow White"" or ""Sleeping Beauty."" ""Tangled"" begins with striking imagery, but buries it beneath a sour, smarmy voice over by this year's prince-not-so-charming, Flynn Ryder (Zachary Levi). As narrator, he cracks jokes at the expense of the archetypical framework—as if he doesn't, and we shouldn't, treat the story with one modicum of seriousness. Being cavalier about your own film isn't a great way to hook your viewers.Thus ""Tangled"" is a disengaging experience from the outset. It downplays its fairy tale roots, but then never defies them. It disinterests us in its world, and then asks us to spend ninety minutes there. Worse, it suffers from sloppy characterization, including one of the single weakest antagonists in Disney history. Donna Murphy plays Mother Gothel to Mandy Moore's Rapunzel, and neither has a lick of personality. The irksome Flynn is practically the only other human character, with the rest of the world being populated by nameless thugs and townspeople. When so much relies on so few, you'd think more attention would be paid to making them distinct.Essentially, Repunzel's sole remarkable trait is her magic hair, a plot device that is curiously ignored throughout the film. There are plenty of early gags visualizing how she manipulates it (for instance, in order to lift her mother into the tower), but it's clearly an afterthought as her adventure is set into motion. To illustrate, the princess emerges from a stream without any indication of the added water weight. She never once has her locks stepped on, snagged, or caught in a door. I thought this movie was called ""Tangled!"" Having hair that long would be a major inconvenience, people!Maybe I'm splitting hairs (ouch); I probably shouldn't have expected anything more from ""Tangled""—it's the near unanimous praise I don't understand. The songs are lousy, the characters are dull (save for one spunky chameleon), and the story merely suffices (but then it's tough to break something that's survived hundreds of years). The film is so clearly catered to a younger crowd that my curmudgeonly opinion is somewhat irrelevant, but with Pixar managing year after year to satisfy the storytelling needs of both adults and children, Disney's ""Tangled"" is an immediate relic. It's a film made for twelve year olds who need to be convinced that fairy tales aren't stupid and boring.""Enchanted"" and ""The Princess and the Frog"" were classic Disney films despite their flaws. Their creators clearly understood what made the studio in its prime so successful. ""Tangled"" is a harmless children's cartoon, but it doesn't recapture any of the magic the company is known for. Instead, it takes a snide approach to the Rapunzel story while simultaneously contributing nothing to it. I may not be the target audience, but to quote an old friend, ""If this is where the monarchy is headed, count me out.""","

"TANGLED","LloydBayer","1 October 2011","When German brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm started collecting folk tales around 1806, little did they know that 200 years later, their faces would be immortalized on a bank note of the highest denomination. Although the Deutsche Mark has been adopted into the Euro, the Grimm Brothers' (as they have been come to be known) story does not end there. From folklore to fairy tales to bedtime storybooks, their enchanting tales have continuously evolved until its present day rendition in cinema. And so we have ""Tangled"", a fluidly narrated, vividly colorful and stunningly animated version of Rapunzel, the original title from a compiled list of fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm. In this latest version, Nathan Greno and Byron Howard directs, while Dan Fogelman tweaks the screenplay without straying too far from the original tale. In a kingdom far away (no, not the same kingdom in ""Shrek"") the Queen is aided during childbirth by a rare flower with magical healing properties. Unbeknown to the King and Queen, an old woman has been keeping herself young and alive for centuries with this flower, but now finds that the healing and rejuvenating power of the flower has transferred to baby Rapunzel during childbirth. The old woman named Gothel then kidnaps Rapunzel and locks her up in a tall tower knowing that the little girl's golden hair holds the power to keep her from aging. Naïve to the outside world, Rapunzel grows up believing Gothel to be her mother but is fascinated by seeing thousands of floating lanterns once every year. Just before her eighteenth birthday, Rapunzel's life changes forever. Having stolen a royal tiara, a thief breaks into the tower but soon learns the hard way that Rapunzel is not a damsel in distress. Together, they escape the tower and head towards the kingdom, but not before having to deal with Gothel, her assassins and the King's royal guards. For a year that gave us quite a few animated features, Disney's ""Tangled"" came in third in terms of box-office performance. While ""Toy Story 3"" took the top spot, ""Shrek Forever After"" managed to secure a second place despite its overdone theatrics and lack of originality. For this reviewer, the real competition was between ""How to Train Your Dragon"", ""Despicable Me"" and ""Tangled"", all of which features an engaging and original story. While ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is cinematically epic, our film under discussion is superior in terms of production and visual brilliance. With a budget of $ 260 million, this is not only the most expensive animated film ever made, it is also the most time consuming, having been in production for six years. The staggering amount of time and money put into this project stems from the fact that Disney has invested in animating hand-drawn images and then injecting three-dimensional depth by employing over 50 CGI artists. The result speaks for itself- a gorgeously rendered animation with such detail, it has to be watched on a HD display to truly appreciate the skill that has gone into its making. What makes this film different is that it carries the High Definition clarity found in PIXAR animations, but with the added bonus of having the original art work traditionally hand painted. I were to guess, Disney has gone through such lengths to produce another animation, probably because this is their 50th title, an accolade in itself and a milestone in this company's 80 year history as a media conglomerate.Like most other Disney productions, the story here has a fare share of fantasy, romance and comedy. Even so, Disney ventures into unchartered waters with elements of sadness, some violence and a scene of drunkenness. Voiced by Donna Murphy, Fogelman's Gothel is not a witch but a woman with a dark heart who is capable of murder. Mandy Moore voices Rapunzel and along with Murphy, lends their voices for some of the film's soundtrack as well. Zachary Levi voices the thief called Flynn Rider, a character who is neither a Prince nor charming. Although Rider and Rapunzel's initial scenes together are met with slapstick comedy, the funniest characters for me are, a royal horse called Maximus and Rapunzel's pet chameleon, Pascal. On the other hand, soundtrack is not as catchy as Disney's famed animations like ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King"". Although nominated for an Academy Award for ""Best original Soundtrack"", this film lost the Oscar to Toy Story 3. Even so, Moore and Levi's duet with ""I see the Light"" is as visually stunning as it is pleasing to the ears.","

"TANGLED","Samiam3","27 March 2011","There's a kind of tenderness to behind Tangled that almost works on it's own with out the need for the so called 'post-modern' approach to fairy tales which brings out the cunning above the sentimentality. Tangled works either way. The film trusts it's material an its audience enough to embrace sentimentality, yet there is also a sense of modernity to the film which gives it that much of an edge. This is one of those a movie where the damsel in distress saves the dashing hero. It's cute as a romance, It's effective as part comedy, it feels organic as a musical (capturing Disney's better days). The ending feels a little cheap, but that's typical of fantasies, and I suppose there is no need to get picky. Tangled works, quite well.","

"TANGLED","lee_eisenberg","29 October 2015","Disney's 50th animated feature is an adaptation of the story of Rapunzel. I thought it neat that Maximus and Pascal put on a performance reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Usually this is the sort of movie that I would spend the whole time heckling like on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"", but I didn't heckle ""Tangled"". I guess that Rapunzel's assertive qualities made her more interesting than previous princesses, kind of like Elsa and Anna in ""Frozen"".And of course I can't resist noting the cast. I only loosely know about Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi. I understand that Donna Murphy is mainly a Broadway star. The rest of the cast catches my attention: Brad Garrett (Everybody Loves Raymond), Ron Perlman (Hellboy), Jeffrey Tambor (Arrested Development) and Richard Kiel (a 7-foot actor best known for a role in the James Bond franchise).So, it's an OK, enjoyable movie. Not any sort of masterpiece. I will say that Rapunzel herself is a hottie.","

"TANGLED","ranblackman","10 April 2019","That's really the best way to describe this movie. With Disney, you usually get movies that can be described this way. Their films, mostly their animated films, have a good streak of fun, cute, funny, and adventure titles that usually feature great theatrical music, and some rather impressive animation to boot.Most all of this can be said for Tangled, as well as it's an admittedly predictable plot. Yes, we have them all is lost moments and a typical story of someone wanting more out of life. Where this film successes in the chemistry between the two leads. Rapunzel and Flynn are really good together. They bring in plenty of laughs and even some rather touching moments in the end. It is all simple, but there is something in that chemistry for everyone.That's what I liked about it, even more, there is not too much childishness. It all evens out, and I did have a good time with it and would say to give it a watch if you haven't yet.","

"TANGLED","Juja1","20 December 2010","This movie felt like a 9 on the entertainment scale. The movie drew me in and made me laugh many times. First Disney movie I liked since years. The 1 point missing to a full ten goes off for the plot holes (...why is it now necessary to sing in order to activate the flower/hair magic, and then again it isn't? ...how did the horse get the bunch of thieves to follow him, plus place them behind open prison doors? ...why wasn't the princess at least a little sad for her stepmother whom she had loved for so many years?...). I liked the loving attention to detail such as in the art-nouveau style wall paintings and the pub scene. While I love the old hand-drawn Disney Classics such as Djungle Book and Aristocats with wonderful swing music, I could never really connect to any Disney movie since then - did not like the over-polished gaudy-coloured look of Aladdin & Co. and the pop-style songs; found Princess & the frog a bit boring, too full of cliché visual references to old-style Disney which did not work in my opinion, and was put off by the unnatural purple colour in the voodoo scenes. Tangled on the other hand seems to look more forward than back, and at the same I thought this feels more like one of the old movies. Some scenes felt almost like a movie scene with real actors, such as the one in the cave. A turn towards realism goes well with me. As another reviewer remarked there were still other scenes of unlikely physics (surviving a huge fall) which made me stumble a bit, but which I did not mind too much. Rapunzel's big-eyed pink barbie look...well...thank god she acted differently. As for the lantern scene...it was beautifully made though maybe just a bit too much, think I heard some viewers disconnecting due to the sentimental overdose and getting a little impatient, at least when having a 3D lantern shoved into our faces :-)...I got this random thought about masses of waste lanterns littering the woods on the next morning, and then all the time I had to think about this poor guy who according to the newspapers is fighting paper lanterns, because one of them came down on their house and killed his son in the resulting fire. He will probably not enjoy the movie as much as I did.","

"TANGLED","The_Film_Cricket","4 April 2011","Going back to my childhood, hearing the story of Rapunzel, there was a nagging issue that always bothered me. Follow me on this: Here is the story of a maiden with extremely long hair who was held captive in the tall tower waiting for her prince to come and rescue her. When he arrives, he implores her ""Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let down your hair!"", to which she drops her hair down to ground level so he can climb it like a rope. Here's my issue: He's a grown man, climbing her hair like a rope . . . that is attached to her head! How is her hair not being pulled out by the roots? That's a question, I'm afraid that no one seems to be able to properly answer, neither in the 199 year-old tale told first written by The Brother's Grimm nor in Disney's lively new computer-animated version which turns Rapunzel's over-developed locks into a tool of 1001 uses. Seriously, she hangs from it, makes a jump rope with it, and even ties the intruding prince to a chair with it. I guess the easy answer is: her hair is magic, lay off! Here it is explained that her blond locks have the power to heal when she sings a certain song. What happens if she gets the words wrong? The story in this version tells us that when Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) was a baby, her hair was accidentally enchanted by an old crone called Mother Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy) who had discovered a spell for retaining her youth and beauty. In order to keep the enchantment safe, she kidnapped the child, pretended to be her mother and locked her in a tall tower and forbade her to step outside. As Rapunzel grew up, she wondered, naturally, what was out there. As she grows, so does her hair. If she cuts it, her hair turns brown and the spell dies. Got it? Good! Her salvation is not a regal prince but a thieving goof named Flynn Rider (voiced by Zachary Levi of TV's ""Chuck""). Flynn is not his real name, I'll leave that for you to discover. Anyway, he has stolen some crown jewels and is on the run from some of the palace guards. He finds himself stashing away in Rapunzel's tower until the heat's off - that's how he comes to find himself tied to a chair by her long hair. Naturally the story will involve the pair falling in love and doing battle with Mother Gothel for the enchantment that lies within those golden tresses.The story is a bit standard. The love story, the magic spell, the villain, the music. They are all lifted from a hundred other Disney musicals. I think the screenwriters knew that because they were smart enough to give the movie a wicked sense of humor. All of the characters have bold personalities, whip-smart dialogue and wonderfully expressive faces. This is a fun movie just to listen to. In tone, the movie has the kind of wise-cracky freshness and sense of humor that made Shrek so special (and that its sequels never quite achieved).The film also benefits from the presence of two wonderful supporting characters. One is a chameleon who is Rapunzel's only companion. His face is very expressive and so is his ever-shifting skin color the functions like a mood ring. The other is a very clever horse, part of the king's guard. He is ever-efficient and ever-determined to hunt down Flynn and bring him to justice. This is some horse, not only is he a beast of burden but he's also part bloodhound and, at one point, a pretty good swordsman. The fact that these two characters never speak allows their body language to speak for them. They are more expressive that way.'Tangled' is part of the new 3D revolution. The palette is made of vibrant with colors that are clean and polished. The characters almost resemble Barbie Dolls. That may be the film's only real flaw, it is too clean. There's nothing in the artistry to make it distinctive or to further the art of animation or to try new things. Immediately after I saw Tangled, I saw the wonderful Irish animated feature The Secret of Kells - this happened purely by coincidence. That film had a texture and a form of the illustrations one might find in a children's story book. The characters were angular, squared and pointed in a way that matched their personalities (Think of the form of ""Samurai Jack"" and you get the idea""). Here the characters and the landscapes all look manufactured. We don't feel we're looking at a special place, just a manufactured background. Still, with that limitation, I had a good time. I laugh a lot, the characters intrigued me and I walked away with the image of a man with a frying pan dueling a horse with a sword. Where else are you going to see that?","

"TANGLED","Tweekums","26 December 2012","As this story opens leading man, Flynn Rider, tells us how a sunbeam once fell to Earth and became a magical golden flower. This flower was kept by Gothal, an old woman, who used its magic to stay forever young and refuses to share its power. One day, when the pregnant queen is on the verge of death the palace guard search the kingdom and find the flower; they turn it into a medicine that saves the queen. The magic remains though; this time locked within the newborn Princess Rapunzel's hair. Gothal sneaks into the palace to steal a lock of the child's hair but as soon as she cuts it, it turns brown and loses its magic so she takes the baby. The years pass and Gothal raises Rapunzel as her own child; keeping her locked in a tall tower to 'protect' her from the dangers of the world. Rapunzel begs her mother to let her leave the tower to see the lanterns being released on her birthday but the request is refused. As luck would have it Flynn ends up in Rapunzel's tower after fleeing from the royal guard he has just stolen a priceless tiara from the palace! Rapunzel talks him into taking her to see the lanterns and along the way she learns the truth about her 'mother' and the two of them have the expected series of adventures before things appear to go wrong again.This Disney 3D animation may not have been made in collaboration with Pixar but it has a charm of its own and a distinct 'Disney' look and more importantly sound; the characters sing a succession of songs throughout the film. The story is enjoyably with plenty of action, a good number of laughs, enough scares and even an apparent tragedy that may cause a few tears to be shed if you think a Disney film could let a protagonist die. The film's PG certificate is due to the mild violence; this is mostly comical though and frequently involves frying pans so it should be okay for most children to watch unless you are worried they will copy the protagonists and batter each other with frying pans! The animation looks really good; the characters move and show emotion in a genuinely human way even though they are clearly cartoon characters rather than realistically proportioned. I'd certainly recommend this to fans of Disney animation; it may not be classic hand drawn animation but it is still classic Disney.","

The animation is bright, vivid, and lively, the voice work is good, and the songs are passable, if not great. There's just not a lot to complain about, here.

""Flynn"" looks a lot like a young Errol Flynn. ""Rapunzel"" looks like a Barbie doll, right down to her cute button nose.

John Lassiter has truly saved Walt Disney Pictures. Unlike ""Brave"", my family wants to see this movie again and again. Wagner cast iron frying pans are the new medieval secret weapon! Look for Pinocchio ""hidden"" in the rafters of the ""Snugly Duckling"" Pub! Excessive comic violence, hints of execution, a brief death-scene (magically reversed), plus a ""Barbie Doll"" figure on a teenager make this a ""9"" instead of a ""10"".

"TANGLED","Hellmant","7 January 2011","'TANGLED': Three Stars (Out of Five) Disney's 50th animated feature! They spared no expense too, at a whopping $260 million budget it's the second most expensive film in history. The film is a throwback to the great Disney animated films we saw in the 80's and 90's as opposed to the more recent (but it's still a far cry from the classics of the 30's, 40's and 50's). It's a fantasy film based on an old fairy tale again (another from the Brothers Grimm) with plenty of musical numbers. Something kids are sure to love but it may lack the interest of older viewers.Revamped retelling of the Grimms Fairy Tale 'Rapunzel'. It tells the story of a magical flower that has the power to heal the sick and wounded. It also has the power to keep an old witch named Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy) young if she sings to it. The Queen of a nearby village becomes ill and having heard of the flower sends her guards to retrieve it to cure her. They do and the Queen is saved. Shortly later she gives birth to a daughter, Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) and Gothel knows that the powers of the flower still exists in the child's hair as long as it isn't cut. So the witch kidnaps Rapunzel and locks her away in a hidden tower raising her as her own. She forbids Rapunzel from leaving the tower, telling her it's for her safety, and never cuts her hair. 18 years later Rapunzel longs for the outside world and truly dreams of traveling to the mysterious lights she sees every year on her birthday. When a thief (voiced by Zachary Levi, of TV's 'CHUCK' fame) stumbles upon her tower while trying to elude authorities she knocks him out and steals his loot. She then makes a deal with him that she'll give him back his valuables if he agrees to escort her to the magical lights. An adventure begins and of course the two fall in love.The movie is predictable and clichéd but it is somewhat fun and amusing as well. The animation is colorful and beautiful and the jokes are somewhat funny. I didn't find the music to be very well written though and when it gets to be one musical number after another the film starts to drag and for me becomes really uninteresting. The film is clever and visually impressive to a certain extent but I didn't find it to be nearly as entertaining as a lot of the glowing reviews it's been getting (like Quentin Tarantino's 5th place 2010 top 20 placing). It is better than a lot of the more recent Disney animated films though and as a kids film it definitely works. Overall it's a decent animated kids film but certainly not a great one.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYbw_OZUFso","

Since most Disney animated features are based on fairy tales, you can pretty well count on a happy ending. Super CGI places Rapunzel in the company of timeless classics like SNOW WHITE and SLEEPING BEAUTY. Disney never disappoints.Other voices you may recognize: Brad Garrett, Jeffrey Tambor and Ron Perlman.","

"TANGLED","saadgkhan","3 April 2011","TANGLED – CATCH IT ( A ) Tangled is undoubtedly the most charming movie by Disney. It brings the fantastical story of Rapunzel into live again. It's surprising to see that decades have passed by still Disney manages to bring it's beloved stories in totally new enchanting look, which makes them seems like totally new. Tangled is magical blend of humor, music, love and horror. On one side makers have wonderfully achieved bring the magical hairs of Rapunzel into life and on the other side the ending of Tangled is heart wrenching and one of the most daring in Disney movies. Kudos to Disney for having wonderful breathtaking animation and for having Mandy Moore's voice as Rapunzel. Mandy Moore's bring a lot of character to Rapunzel; it was so fascinating to see how she plays with her voice in scenes. Though, on screen we are watching an animation but her voice makes it as believable as any living human. Zachary Levi also did a good job as the thief/hero of Rapunzel. The scenes between him and maximum the White Horse are hilarious. Overall, Tangled is one of the most fascinating and charming animated movie, which takes you into a magical fantastical world.","

This isn't only about a princess and a thief falling in love, but it is also about following your dreams but respecting your elders as well. Mother Gothel, even though she was a villain, had me laughing. It shows, to other mothers, not Mother Gothel in particular, how much mothers can care for their children. They want to protect them. Especially mothers and fathers. Even though Mother Gothel only loved Rapunzel for her magical, long hair, other mothers probably don't. The songs were touching and fun and exciting, and everything about Tangled was a magical expierence for me.","

"TANGLED","rebeccalucy","10 December 2017","Tangled is a beautifully animated film, the lantern scene being absolutely stunning. It can also be used to create fast paced comedy and action. Flynn Rider is one of the best Disney princes, as he has a fun personality that develops throughout the film. The animation allows for some fun expressions between him and Rapunzel, unlike past ones.I think the story is very thought out, giving reasons for Rapunzel to grow out her hair and why Mother Gothel wants her in the first place. It could have been really easy to phone in the plot, but a lot of time went into it. Furthermore, Maximus as the comedic relief is great. He doesn't need to talk to be funny, they allow him to have unique expressions. However, the songs are quite good but don't always further the story. Sometimes they can be a little distracting or take away from the plot. The villain is quite threatening but sometimes needs to be developed a little bit more. In conclusion, a great Disney film with beautiful animation. But could use a little tweaking to make it fantastic!","

I have not been impressed with the past few...But I was very wrong!I watched it with my best friend and we laughed the whole time. Each character had personality and was unique. The story line was interesting and it held our attention throughout the movie. When it was over, I wished there was more to watch. Plus, the voices of the characters fit perfectly! And the soundtrack is excellent. This is a Disney movie that will forever be a favorite of mine. One day, when I have kids, this will be their version of my Cinderella. It is a movie that I am sure any age will love. I am so excited to fall in love with a Disney movie again and hopefully, their will be a Tangled 2!","

I am a high school student, and when I was told we would be watching this movie in class, I was not very enthusiastic, being a guy. After watching part of the movie, I actually came home and finished the rest. A couple of my classmates, also males, admitted they did the same and loved the movie as well. This movie is for any age group, and whether the viewer is a 3 year old girl or a 16 year old boy, they will love it. This is the first movie that has touched me in a long time. It is humorous, action-packed, emotional, and original. The CGI is so realistic and perfect, everything is exactly how one would picture the events as they happen in real life. The characters are witty and funny, all with their own contributions that make the story so great. I cannot describe why, but this movie deeply impacted me. I find clips of the movie popping into my head at random moments, and I think about it repeatedly throughout the day. I have watched it over and over again, never getting tired of it. I really hope that they decide to make a sequel, because this is one of the best movies I have seen, and my peers all agree. I do hope Disney disregards it's tradition of not making sequels for this one, because this was an amazing movie with an incredible, touching story that could have a great continuation.","

"TANGLED","JamesHitchcock","3 January 2013","Several of the early Disney feature-length cartoons (""Snow White"", ""Cinderella"", ""Sleeping Beauty"") were based upon European fairy tale, and with ""Tangled"" the Walt Disney Animation Studios returns to this source of inspiration. Their previous animated feature ""The Princess and the Frog"" had also been very loosely based on a Brothers Grimm folk tale, but in that case the action had been transferred from Europe to twentieth-century America. ""Tangled"" is likewise only loosely based upon the original tale, but at least it keeps the traditional European setting. The film was originally titled ""Rapunzel"", after the fairy tale on which it is based, but this was changed to ""Tangled"" shortly before its release. The change, which caused some controversy, was apparently motivated by the studio's concern that their recent animated features, with their stress on the ""Disney Princesses"", had only appealed to girls, and their belief that by shifting the emphasis in the title away from the leading female character they could make the film more attractive to boys. (In a similar fashion Disney's current animation project, based upon Anderson's ""The Snow Queen"" and to be released later this year, has been renamed ""Frozen""). Despite the change of title, the film still keeps the heroine's odd- sounding name (not a normal Christian name even in German and one which I could never pronounce as a child). In this version Rapunzel lives in a secluded tower with a woman named Gothel whom she believes to be her mother. In fact, Rapunzel is the daughter of the king and queen of a nearby kingdom, and Gothel has kidnapped her in order to exploit Rapunzel's ultra-long hair which has magical properties. Gothel has forbidden her supposed ""daughter"" to leave the tower in which she lives, but Rapunzel yearns to explore the wider world which she has never seen, and manages to escape with the help of a young man. I have often thought that the changing appearance of the Disney Princesses sheds an interesting light upon changing attitudes to female beauty. Snow White from the thirties, although she is supposed to be an adult woman, always looks disturbingly adolescent. Cinderella and Aurora from the fifties are both cool blondes, the first with something of the looks of Grace Kelly, the second resembling a blonde Audrey Hepburn. There were to be no princesses in the sixties and seventies, a period when the studio's cartoons were mostly about animals rather than humans, but Ariel from the eighties reverts to the innocent child-woman look popularised by some of the models and actresses of the era, such as Samantha Fox. The princesses of the nineties, the decade of the supermodel, are much more curvaceous and adult-looking, such as Pocahontas and Jasmine in ""Aladdin"". Tiana from ""The Princess and the Frog"", the first black Princess, made her appearance in the year that America's first black President took office. Rapunzel again has something of the adolescent about her, resembling a young Sarah Michelle Gellar, but then she is supposed to be only eighteen. She is, however, something of a feisty, feminist princess, the sort of girl who prefers to take the initiative rather than sit around in the hope of being rescued by a prince. In the Grimm story, Rapunzel is indeed rescued by a prince, but here her love-interest is a handsome young commoner named Flynn Rider. Far from being royal, Flynn- presumably named after Errol- is something of a rogue; when we first meet him he is on the run after stealing the tiara of the ""lost princess"", as Rapunzel has become known after her disappearance. Of course, he later becomes a reformed character; indeed, the human capacity to reform oneself and become something new is a recurrent theme in the film. Rapunzel succeeds in rediscovering her true identity, rejecting the false one which has been forced on her by Gothel, and a gang of scary-looking thugs all turn out to be rather gentler than their appearance might suggest. They also have some surprising ambitions, which Rapunzel encourages them to pursue. Disney villainesses are generally portrayed either as ugly (Cinderella's stepsisters) or as scary-looking (the Wicked Queen in ""Snow White"" or the Wicked Fairy in ""Sleeping Beauty""), but Gothel, a pretty thirty- something, is much more normal-looking, although her brunette colouring and sharper features indicate that, contrary to what she might claim, there is no blood relationship between her and the blonde, sweet-faced Rapunzel. Gothel, in fact, despite her villainy, is generally presented as a comic figure, a neurotically and ludicrously over-protective mother, rather than a figure of pure evil. (Gothel also gets to sing the film's most memorable song, ""Mother Knows Best"").The other character that stands out is Maximus, the horse belonging to the captain of the Royal Guards and an enthusiastic pursuer of evildoers, an animal counterpart to the heroes of all those ""tough cop"" movies. Like most Disney Princesses, Rapunzel has her own animal companion, a pet chameleon named Pascal. My personal preference has always been for the traditional hand-drawn style of animation rather than the computer generated version. ""Tangled"", however, is one of the more visually attractive examples of the latter style, often with a look reminiscent of a painting; apparently the eighteenth-century French artist Jean-Honoré Fragonard was a major influence on the animators. I am not going to award this film a mark out of ten, as children's films need to be judged by different criteria to films for adults, preferably by the children themselves. I can, however, say that ""Tangled"" is a very enjoyable piece of family entertainment, with plenty of excitement and amusement for all.","

"TANGLED","changmoh","21 November 2010","With or without 3-D, ""Tangled"" looks set to overtake last year's under-achieving ""The Princess and the Frog"" at the box-office. What's more, its non-verbal horse named Maximus is bound to give Shrek's talkative Donkey a run for the money! The tale of Rapunzel (voice of Mandy Moore) gets a revisionist twist here and she is 'rescued' not by a handsome prince on a white horse but a young, egoistic bandit (Zachary Levi as Flynn Rider) and a horse (named Maximus) that thinks it is a dog. The villain is Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy), the narcissistic witch who imprisons our princess in a secluded tower.Like ""Beauty & The Beast"" and ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Rapunzel"" also comes with musical and dance numbers. Except for 'Mother Knows Best', most of them have yet to catch on with the public. They may not be as catchy as those of Little Mermaid but given time, some may actually work their magic.What I like best are the solid Disney characterisations, especially of its animals. Mandy Moore's Rapunzel suitably represents Every Girl who is forced to stay home; Flynn plays the Bad Boy-type who sorely needs to be tamed and corrected by the proverbial Love; and the manipulative Mother Gothel aptly reflects the way some kids view their over-protective parent.The show-stealers are the mandatory animal sidekicks - a chameleon named Pascal and the palace horse Maximus. These are not just supporting characters but they have actual 'acting' duties as well. And the fact that they do not speak, helps to boost realism and makes them even funnier. Of course, the action is popcorn stuff but the social themes it explores make for worthy parental contemplation. A fitting film for everyone to let down their hair. - By LIM CHANG MOH (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)",NA
"TANGLED","Sweetigal85","25 June 2017","This movie is simply the greatest version of Rapunzel that has ever been told. As a kid, this was always one of my least favorite stories. It was definitely lacking structure and depth, but Disney imbued their magic into its pages and made it a dazzling work of art.Rapunzel is a fabulous very first CGI princess and Mandy Moore was an amazing choice, both for her delightfully sweet speaking/singing voice and her general whimsicality. Mandy Moore has now ascended to stardom as one of the legendary Disney Princesses.From start to finish, it is a feast for the eyes and envelops you completely in the magical story. Rapunzel is the very first Disney princess to possess any kind of magic!!! Yes, magic has been clearly present in every other princess movie, but think about it...none of the princesses ever wielded any form of magic themselves until now. So that makes this movie groundbreaking just for that alone.In the original, the male love interest was the prince, so I am glad they jazzed this version up and made him a lovable thief instead. Flynn is an amazing character and he and Rapunzel have one of the greatest meet cutes of all time. It is very Shakespearean that the audience knows that Gothel is NOT Rapunzel's mother and that she does NOT possess this knowledge as we do. We also know that she is the lost princess and that Gothel is stalking her with the Stabbington brothers who are stalking Flynn for revenge. Very poetic and well done.Every single song was gold. They were catchy and whimsical and the lyrics were apt and beautiful. The animal companions which are usually my least favorite part of every Disney movie were actually terrific in this film. It makes sense that Rapunzel would have flocked to some sort of creature in her lonely tower so Pascal's presence is believable and not just crowbarred in like many others. The horse Maximus is absolutely hilarious and actually serves the plot tremendously.The redeemable villains were very well done, particularly Flynn's. His backstory as Eugene Fitzherbert is extremely touching as well as his transformation from common thief to Rapunzel's lover.What is refreshingly different about Flynn and Rapunzel's romance is that they did not have a typical love at first sight reaction like most Disney couples do. True, they were definitely both attracted to each other right away, but love blossomed between them as their epic journey commenced. To me, this makes it all the more meaningful.The ending was unexpectedly dark and I wish Disney dared to go down paths like this more often. There is always that classic moment in every Disney movie were you are legitimately terrified that the character in peril is really going to die (Whereas in Lion King, they actually DO)It is so beautiful that Rapunzel was actually going to sacrifice the rest of her life to being Gothel's fountain of youth, just to save the man she loved. And Flynn reciprocated this beauty by not allowing her to snuff out her light to restore his. When he says ""But if you do this, you will die."" He surely meant that if she goes through with being Gothel's slave for all eternity, she will cease to be the wonderful soul that she is now. Such torturous treatment would drain her and cause the light in her eyes to wither and die, even if she persisted to live because of the magical flower. So that is why Flynn frees her from her curse and chops of all her precious hair, even though that means sacrificing himself. People argue that he could have let her heal him and THEN chopped off her hair, but he refused to use her for her power just like Gothel and the rest of the world would have wanted to. The rhyme that activates the flower is beautiful and when Rapunzel cries onto Flynn's face, I personally believe that this is the very last of her healing powers leaking out of her now that the power of the golden flower has been severed. Their kiss is beautiful, I absolutely love how Rapunzel seizes the lapels of his shirt and yanks him toward her. The look of delighted surprise on his face when she does this is so adorable. I really love how powerful and forceful Disney princesses have become. And then later on in the end, she dips him instead of him dipping her. I love it! Gothel's demise is poetically and brilliantly executed and it goes to show how sweet Rapunzel is that she still reaches out helplessly toward the despicable woman she loved and knew to be her mother.My absolute favorite part of the whole movie is when Rapunzel's parents see her again and the mother just knows it is her by looking in her eyes and touching her face. I thought it was really beautiful and interesting that they chose to not have the parents speak at all, they displayed all of their emotions through facial expressions and gestures. My favorite moment is when Rapunzel and her parents drop to the floor in their ecstatic embrace and the queen reaches out her hand to Eugene. He goes to bow to her but she seizes his hand and pulls him into their embrace and thus welcomes him without question into their family because he is the man who returned Rapunzel to them and who loves their daughter. So beautiful! I really stand by that this is one of the greatest movies ever made. It has something for everyone. Love, adventure, betrayal, humor, heart-warming songs. This is definitely one of the funniest Disney movies of all time. The humor between them is very carefully scripted and honestly I think better suits an older crowd. But kids can still appreciate the slapstick with the frying pan haha.LOVE LOVE LOVED IT!!!",NA
"TANGLED","fritzlang","27 November 2010","Just got back from a 3D showing of Tangled with 2 10 year old girls.The movie was GREAT! One of the more enjoyable kids films I have seen - it REALLY works for adults as much as kids..and not just girls either.The animation was top notch and VERY effective use of 3D. Much better than Toy Story. The 3D definitely enhanced the film, and there were some scenes that we actually reached out our hands to try to grab something! A first for us! The story seemed a little 'meatier' and mature than some of the other Disney films, while retaining the formula 'spunky girl goes after her dream and nobody is going to stop her.' I really don't want to talk about the plot because I thought it was very well laid out, with a TERRIFIC villainess, and a smart alec -tho-you'll-learn-to-love-him guy and a really likable girl. But it s a very clever take on the Rapunzel story.I was never bored.. I laughed (the humor is REALLY good - so slapstick, but some refreshingly subtle humor too). and yes, I cried (won't tell you why).This may be the most enjoyable Disney film I have seen in a LONG time.There were only 2 things I wished they did differently.1) The songs. They were 'okay' and served the film well, but nothing really stood out. I left the theater and couldn't remember one song. Nothing like ""under the sea"" or ""circle of life"" from the earlier films that stay with you after the credits have long gone by.2) speaking of credits, these were the lamest closing credits I think I have ever seen in a big budget film. There was nothing to keep our interest (and the closing credits were LONG).. No animation.. no clips.. no outtakes.. no surprise scene at the end, etc. Just text scroll. Of course, most people don't include closing credits in their review, but I have seen so many clever credits (remember Lemony Snicket's closing credits?) that after such a cleverly done film, just seeing plain text scroll for 5 minutes was disappointing.. Of course, we were the only ones left in the theater watching the credits so this may mean nothing to most people...Highly recommended for the entire family.9 out of 10.",NA

"TANGLED","johnstonjames","20 March 2011","wow. i really thought this was a lot of fun. it was also pure Disney. the CGI animated films released directly by Disney (Meet The Robinsons, Chicken Little),often feel more like authentic Disney than the Pixar/Disney collaborations.not that the Pixar films aren't the best in the field of CGI animation, and do utilize a totally Disney approach, but there is always a underlying element of collaboration that often feels as much Pixar as Disney. unlike Buena Vista distribution which was established by Disney himself in the 1950's after he left RKO, Pixar was a independent production facility that originally had nothing to do with Disney.i also happen to feel that fairy tales are often what Disney does best. i love fairy tales. so i guess this had more appeal to me and felt more like the Disney classics i grew up with. the animation in Pixar/Disney films is more elaborate and accomplished, but this had more of the ""Disney"" heart to it. 'Finding Nemo' and 'Cars' were excellent films and had better, more proficient animation, but in some ways i enjoyed this film even more.'Tangled' is also a little more psychologically deeper than the usual Pixar films. 'Tangled' might very well be Disney's most psychologically complex film next to their film 'Enchanted'. i've always felt that 'Enchanted' has some of the most complicated and revealing psychology of any Disney film including Disney's golden age of classics. 'Enchanted' kind of works as couch therapy for Disney fans brought up on fairly simplistic, straight forward happy ending philosophies. 'Tangled' might not be as philosophical about the whole fairy tale happy ending thing, but the psychology of the witch/step mother, is pretty intense. the step mother tries to control the girl with fear and manipulation. something our current society often thrives on.i'm not saying that every time a adult enforces authority on a child is unjustified, but this certainly gives the viewer something to think about. the only problem here is that it does sort of make ""alternative"" parenting look bad.still, there are little or no flaws here. it's pretty much perfect and perfectly delectable family fare. teen age girls especially will probably eat it up and hang on every word. don't see why not. even though 'Tangled' is for all audience members, it's primary appeal will be mostly for teen age girls and young women.if you are a true Disney fan, and one that loves the ""princess"" fairy tale movies like i do, you'll get a real kick out of this winner. i suggest that even if you are not a die hard Disney fan, you let your hair down, sit back, and just dig this sugary, Disney treat.",NA
"TANGLED","rosiethorns88","11 November 2010","I was part of a select, lucky crowd attending an early screening of this film at the 2010 Red Stick Animation Festival, where we were treated with the presence of one of Tangeled's animation supervisors, Clay Kaytis.It was exciting to hear from Kaytis about the film's production such as how Rapunzel's hair had to be customarily animated depending on the scene - some by bone systems and dynamics, others by painstakingly hand animating her long golden locks. What was most thrilling, was to find out that Glen Keane (a legend among modern Disney Animators) would check the 3D animation on Rapunzel and hand draw over her movements as 2D traditional animation where it was necessary to show her 3D animators how to ""make her movements beautiful"" - and it truly shows!The film's story and characters are also at the same level as its visuals. The premise is great; the short story of the classic tale was fleshed out in an entertaining adventure that can easily stand on its own. The characters are distinct and carry great chemistry - especially between the two leads.The film's songs are the only things that fall short of the full mark. While they are very tolerable and help carry the storytelling, nothing memorable stands out after the first viewing (with the exception of the Mother Knows Best Reprise - Donna Murphy shines with this one). However, they may require several viewings before I'm completely hooked on them (I'm looking at you, Princess and the Frog) Tangled is the film that definitely deserves the spot as Walt Disney's 50th Animated Film. Strong plot, lovable characters and lusciously stunning animation - it's a perfect storm of the Walt Disney magic we've been holding our breath for.",NA

"TANGLED","aharmas","11 December 2010","When ""The Princess and The Frog"" came out, we rejoiced because old fashioned animation, a strong storyline, a different yet strong heroine, and some very funny moments had all worked well to give us a new classic. It was indeed a very good movie, with marvelous music numbers and gorgeous animation.This year, the animation, with the help of more sophisticated computers, has achieved new heights, creating a softer, more natural look, to resemble old fashioned artwork. The problem is that the other elements are not up to the technical standards. We have rather bland vocal entries in most of the leading performances, and both the music and the storyline could have been much better.As it is the case in most of the films we see nowadays there is strong emphasis on coming up with ""potentially good ideas"", yet their development somehow comes short. Here our heroine's dreams, which we sympathize with, draw us into her world, and we can't help but admire the simple but strong young woman who tries to break herself free from the only world she knows. To get there, she is assisted by a dashing young man, who must learn to grow up as well.While as the heroines of recent animated stories, all have assertive and independent personalities, mostly based on their embracing knowledge through books (""Beauty and The Beast""), poor bravado and curiosity (""The Little Mermaid""), or the aspiring chef of ""The Princess and The Frog"". Those characters mesmerized us, with the help of clever, intelligent lyrics, and hummable melodies. ""Tangled"" can't compete in either department, as the very simplistic, underdeveloped characters are poorly served by the pedestrian lyrics.There are a couple of magic moments in the film, but even those feel forced, as part of a design, not of a fully realized work. Nothing here can match the anxiety and sadness of the furnace scene in ""Toy Story"", the wonder of the birth of love in ""Beauty and The Beast"" or witnessing mortality in ""Up"". Animation has grown so much recently; it's hard to feel satisfied by efforts like this film.",NA

When the evil stepmother breaks into song too, (what she actually is, I won't spoil it for those who may not have seen it yet), needless to say didn't help matters much.Things recover a little bit after we are introduced to the gentleman thief. Though, he is nowhere as rogue as I would like (this is after all Disney), I liked this character enough to keep watching. When the lost princess shows a little spunk as well, that's when my interest really kicked in.Now for the best part: Can you believe that it is a song? I couldn't believe it either. It's corny, predictable but handled in such a way that I was surprised I was laughing so much during it. Tough guys with soft hearts have been covered since the silent film days, but whatever. Just look at the scene and you will laugh your head off.The conclusion is again a little predictable and it made me a little sad that the second act didn't sustain itself into the third.

So here it goesTangled, the movie that kicked off the Disney Revival Era and ended the period of Dark Age for Disney, is also one of their best creations to date that easily holds up to the magic of the Disney Renaissance. This movie is the pinnacle of Disney's Modern Day Fairytales and features loveable characters, catchy music, a menacing villain and one of the best romance stories in Disney History.The story is kinda similar to the previous Disney Princess movies but the smart writing makes the story and the world its own while still keeping the magic of Disney's previous Princess movies though some aspects of it can feel a little cliche at times but it's not that big of a problem. Rapunzel is easily one of the most likable, charming and hilarious Disney protagonist. She has this warm energy that makes you fall in love with the character the moment she appears on screen. Flynn Rider aka Eugene Fitzherbert was one of the best parts of the movie. He's funny and cunning but has a soft side which he let's out after he meets Rapunzel. He practically carries the whole film with his perfect comedic timings. Mother Gothel is a great Disney villain. She has all the qualities of the previous Disney villains. She's manipulative, cunning, wicked and a little bit of sassy. Her solo number Mother Knows Best shows how manipulative she is to Rapunzel feeding her with all the lies about the human world. Maximus is great. He's expressions and chemistry with Flynn Rider is really hilarious to watch. Pascal was just there. The romance between Rapunzel and Flynn is electric. You really buy their love for each other and I like how this isn't a love at first sight kind of a situation. Their bond grows more and more with each conversation and crazy adventures.The animation is beautiful as always. The movie has a warm and storybook feel to it, from Rapunzel's Tower to the environments, which really makes it stands out from a lot of Disney movies from the same time period. Though it is not as detailed as some of the more recent Disney Princess movies but that's not really a problem when you've got a whole cast of such expressive and entertaining characters.The music by Alan Menken is good however some songs aren't memorable. I See The Light is the standout. The vocals, the visuals, the lyrics they all sell it perfectly. When Will My Life Begin is a lively song that introduces us to Rapunzel. Mother Knows Best and I've Got a Dream are good in their own ways but are somewhat forgettable nonetheless.That's my review of Tangled. It's a funny, heartwarming, beautiful, witty and enchanting movie that audiences of all ages can enjoy.",NA
"TANGLED","Simarium","9 August 2018","This movie has a pretty weak soundtrack compared to most Disney movies. But, on the flip side, Flynn Ryder is fairly memorable, and the animation is beautiful.

The princess secretly took the princess out of the palace from an early age, told the princess that the world outside was very evil, and imprisoned the princess on the tower. The beautiful princess can only see the outside world through the window every day. On the princess's birthday, there are always many sky lanterns flying in the night sky, because their appearance makes the princess be emotional and curious about the outside world.

"TANGLED","cnycitylady","29 December 2012","When was the last time we got a Disney Princess we loved so much? Repunzel in Disney's Tangled is the newest and by god she's awesome! With this story Disney added a new twist to a classic tale without losing sight of the endearing story that young girls loved so much. And they utilized it in a way so that boys aren't left out. I know so many boys and men who love this movie. There is just something in the characters that speak out to the audience and pulls you in. Flynn Rider (or Eugene) is the lovable thief who steals Rapunzel's heart when he helps her fulfill her dream. And Rapunzel is the quirky, innocent shut in who comes out of her shell and opens her heart to all the wonders of the world and all of the wonders of love when she gains Flynn's love in exchange for her own. The animation is startlingly colorful and superb. Disney went with the computer animation, against its usual hand drawn animations for a Princess tale, but for the story they provided you find that it works well, hell, maybe even better than the hand drawings would have. For the characters who are very ""Chibi"" like, they emit real human faults and feelings. Their facial expressions just kill you as you see the pain, excitement, joy, love and regret in their eyes. The songs are good catchy tunes, sure to echo in your mind long after the movie has ended. And the villainy is terrific. Mother Gothel is one of the greatest Disney villains ever created. She not only steals the baby princess but raises her and then still has no qualms about hurting her physically and mentally. She never got all mushy and redeeming, she knew what she wanted and how to get it and she stood evil until the end, a good trait in any bad guy. Tangled may be the equivalent to Disney's The Little Mermaid because, just like back in the 80s the world had just about given up on Disney, but after seeing this movie, you will be a believer again.",NA
"TANGLED","elisabethnieshalla","24 October 2019","""Flower gleam and glow. Let your powers shine. Make the clock reverse..."" so I can re-watch Tangled over and over again! The girl, the guy, the chameleon sidekick, the comical horse, the evil mother - this film has all the essential aspects that make an incredible Disney princess movie. More than that, however, it offers a fresh plot that takes a heartwarming spin on the beloved classic story of Rapunzel. Even if the average princess movie isn't typically your thing, I encourage you to give Tangled a shot. Its humor, music, and genuine characters may just take you by surprise and capture your heart like they did mine.It all starts with a single flower. The king and queen of Corona are expecting a child, but when the child's time comes to be born, the queen falls very ill. The only thing that can save her is a magic golden flower. Our villain, Mother Gothel, has been using the flower's healing powers to keep herself young, but she loses her source of life when the flower is picked and taken to heal the queen. However, the baby girl (Rapunzel) is born with beautiful long, blonde hair that has the magical qualities of the flower. So Gothel steals the baby and takes her to a hidden tower where the evil woman raises Rapunzel as her own, using the girl's hair to preserve her own youth. Every year on Rapunzel's birthday, the kingdom lets up thousands of floating lanterns to remember the lost princess; and every year, the lost princess watches from her tower window and wonders if maybe those lanterns are somehow meant for her.Our heroine, Rapunzel, is the epitome of beauty and delight. Mother Gothel has kept the free spirit of her ""flower"" caged in the tower for her entire life, but with the princess' eighteenth birthday drawing near, the young girl is ready to take that step of rebellion and adventure. A desperate, love-struck, helpless female victim is something that Rapunzel most definitely is not. She is far above her fellow princesses, such as Cinderella and Snow White, and is a positive influence on little and grown up girls alike. She exudes confidence and loving-kindness that inspires one to see the beauty in every person and in every situation. Her beautiful golden hair is an important part of who she is, but that is not where she places her identity. Although Rapunzel is not perfect, her faults give her character a realness and relatability. She learns from her mistakes and continues to fight for the things that matter most. Rapunzel embodies independence, bravery, adventure, passion, and beauty, and she's not too bad with the frying pan either.Enter Flynn Rider: a thief who has stolen the princess' crown from the castle and, in his escape, happens upon Rapunzel's dwelling place. He climbs up the tower, and just when he thinks he is out of danger, he is hit on the head with a loud dong. Rapunzel stands stunned with her frying pan in hand. In a moment of pure childlike wonder, she stares at the unconscious intruder. Despite Mother Gothel's strict orders to never leave the tower, Rapunzel orders charismatic Flynn to take her to see the flying lanterns. Together, they face every kind of adventure from dream-filled drunkards to palace guards to a very stubborn horse, and what starts out as an obligation quickly turns into a caring friendship, and eventually a sweet romance. Flynn guides Rapunzel to discover who she truly is, and she helps him see his worth apart from being a criminal.A believable, powerful, sweet love story in Disney princess movies can prove to be a rare occurrence, but Tangled fulfills this essential quality through Flynn and Rapunzel's romance. Their love comes to fruition in an inexpressibly stunning scene where they are in a boat with the floating lanterns all around them. The magic of the moment is captivating as the lanterns' glittering reflections in the water and their encompassing glow creates a beautiful, magical, and romantic atmosphere. However, a good love story is not without trials. So often, the love story in Disney princess movies is shallow and fails to show the selflessness of love. If you are weary of ""love at first sight"" and desperate female figures being swept off their feet by a rich, handsome prince, then Tangled will surely offer some fresh and enjoyable entertainment. As you will see in the end, their love transcends infatuation and shows that true love requires sacrifice.It would do the film injustice if I did not also mention the incredible soundtrack that enhances this story. You don't have to be sitting on your couch in front of your television to experience the wonderment of this endearing film, for the lyrics and compositions so appropriately capture the emotions of the moments in which they are sung. Not only are they geniusly written, but for me these songs are the centerpiece of so many precious memories. Whether you're dramatically acting them out in the car with friends or screaming them at the top of your lungs in the dish room at camp, the soundtrack isn't just for the film; it's a soundtrack for your life. From the haunting melody of the ""Healing Incantation"" to the joyous and lighthearted ""I've Got A Dream,"" the music will have you leaving with a smile in your heart and a skip in your step.At the end of any great movie, justice is served. The ending must be satisfying yet not too predictable. Tangled checks the box for a fantastic ending. It introduces real life themes of death and loss but also of love and sacrifice. As this journey you've gone on with the characters comes to its climax, your mind is spinning trying to determine how it all will end. When I sat in the theater in 2010 watching the film for the first time as a seven-year-old girl, a gasp rose from the audience as the gripping moment came to fruition. This enthralling end will have you on the edge of your seat with suspense and excitement, but you will ultimately walk away with a genuine sense of joy and satisfaction. The conclusion of this story is not completely perfect and happy, but that makes it real, for in life there is always a price to pay for the things most worth having.Rapunzel's hair and its magical powers seem to be the center of the story. That was why Mother Gothel stole her in the first place and why she was never allowed to leave the tower. In the end, however, it's not about her beautiful magic hair, but about the importance of courage, the steadfastness of a family, and the power of true love. Disney hit the sweet spot with this princess movie. Its heroine, though not without flaws, has a strong, confident, exuberant personality that captures your heart and inspires you to relentlessly chase after your dreams. Rapunzel and Flynn's love story is genuine and believable, a rarity among other Disney princess movies, and the music is music for the soul. Real, raw justice is served that gives you a fulfilled spirit to go out and face the world with courage. The next time you sit down for movie night, I encourage you to give Tangled a chance, for his film isn't just an hour and a half of quality entertainment, it is an endearing story that will leave you changed for the better and for good.",NA
"TANGLED","YesthatChristine","24 November 2010","I took my two boys to see this, the older of which was kind of irked at being dragged to a 'princess' movie but I'm happy to report we all enjoyed it. The only reason I'm really writing a review (since its getting enough positive reviews to really cover most of what I liked about it) is to say that there IS a reason to see it besides the 3D effects.I am not a huge fan of 3D films, in fact, it is rare that I don't find it to be a distraction. Frankly I don't WANT to be tricked into believing I'm actually *in* the film unless I'm at an amusement park, perhaps. I like my distance from the goings-on within the picture.We saw this without 3D and the breathtaking scenery was more than enough to feed the senses on its own. Don't feel like you need to shell out the extra 8 bucks for 3D (the upgrade in cost per matinée ticket in my neck of the woods) because its perfectly enjoyable without it. All that being said, it doesn't have quite the clout or likability of the very best Disney when it comes to the songs and pacing, but I would still give this picture a low A, recommend it for family viewing and see it again with a friend if they wanted to. This was far and away better than the Frog Princess, a film which I found terrified my youngest child and bored my older one.",NA
"TANGLED","johnnymacbest","5 December 2010","What a joyful movie. Generally, I'm not an animated movie fan(especially the CG type) but this is an exception. Filled with witty songs and dialog with stunning vistas and voice acting, ""Tangled"" is not only a film, it's also a metaphor for the many conflicting emotions the characters exhibit in the film such as Rapunzel's desire to see the outside world, to Mother Gothel wanting to shelter her from it(for reasons unknown to her but to the audience) to Flynn wanting to make a name for himself. I was utterly surprised despite being a kid's film, it also touches on some pretty adult subject matter such as ageism, selfishness, desire, and love. That was really unexpected from a film of this type. Although it is loosely based on the legend of Rumplestilskin, Tangled is one of the best animated films of this year. See it in 3D to get the full effect.",NA
"INSIDE OUT","pickle-92642","30 January 2011","I just knew this was gonna be amazing. Such a great idea for an animated movie, even by Pixar's standards. It's truly a perfectly executed vision that did not disappoint on almost all levels. There's a lot of fun to be had with this, it's one of the funnier and more thought provoking Pixar movies. The scene where Bing Bong disappears is also extremely sad. I could also tell that this is one of Pixar's more mature films, about the struggles of growing up. It explored Nostalgia for most of the movie without even using the word. When sadness touched a core memory and turned it blue, it was a symbol for Riley feeling nostalgic for her best memories. In my book, this is yet another Pixar classic.","

"INSIDE OUT","Reckno64","29 December 2010","I hate to see so many 1 star reviews claiming this movie was ""too depressing"". Everyone who said that missed the point completely. Growing up ain't all sunshine and rainbows, it comes with a lot of hardships and that's what this movie is about. Riley's emotions try to help her through the difficulty of moving to a new place that isn't all its cracked up to be, and in the process Joy accidentally sends Riley into a deep depression. Sounds depressing, but what makes this movie great is how realistic her depression feels as Joy and Sadness try to help Riley out of it. I feel like this movie's message is ""Growing up will be tough, but you will get through it and there are people who will always help you through it."" and that is a VERY important message for children.Throughout the movie there are plenty of good jokes, gorgeous animation, and a beautiful score by Michael Giacchino (idk how to spell that....) Again, just my two cents, but I think this a great movie, if very different and a bit more depressing by Pixar standards.REALLY starting to think people are just coming to trash all of Pixar's most recent movies out of jealousy or something. There's no way so many people think this movie is garbage. If the good movies are really getting this many bad reviews, it's no wonder the quality of animated movies is going down. There's just no reason to try anymore......","

"INSIDE OUT","Animany94","9 January 2011","I did exactly what I was supposed to when watching this brilliant movie, I felt all the emotions at some point. Pixar did it again with Inside Out. For a long time I had stubbornly repeated that Toy Story would always be my favourite from Pixar, but I changed my mind shortly after watching this one. Like Toy Story you were offered a setup every adult can identify. Growing up learning how to control your feelings and learning the importance of every one of them. It is okay to be angry, sad, happy and afraid as long as we are taught how to manage them. The idea of having this control panel inside a human body has been done before by Osmosis Jones (2001), but let's say with much less success. Inside out takes it to the highest level of perfection. I loved the way Pixar made this world inside the main character of Riley, it is very creatively done and was in some ways just how I had imagined it. I must admit that I cried a couple of times during the movie, because it has some really touching moments. You should be feeling all emotions when watching Inside Out. It is a must watch.","

"INSIDE OUT","Phil_Chester","15 February 2020","I confess that I had to watch this twice before I could properly assess it. It's definitely not a young children's film, as there's precious little to entertain them, but it does have much to consider for older children and (young) adults. As a rumination on what drives us all through life, this is very effective, but I do feel that the story lacks something for making Riley so isolated in her world. Perhaps if she interacted a bit more in the story, this would be a more involving film, but the reflections on lost innocence do add some poignancy and lift this film slightly above average.","

"INSIDE OUT","TheLittleSongbird","24 November 2010","Most of Pixar's films are wonderful (short films too), and while the three films made after Toy Story 3 weren't up to their top standards they were still better than most animation companies at their worst. Inside Out was nothing short of a masterwork, Pixar's best since Toy Story 3 and one of their best overall.Pixar films can be relied upon to have great animation, and Inside Out certainly does have great animation. No, wonderful animation and some of the company's most ingeniously inventive, with gorgeously vibrant colours, a very imaginatively rendered setting (and the lands even more ingeniously done, the next land more so than the last), very meticulous and beautifully modelled backgrounds and clever character designs that match the emotions more than ideally. Michael Giacchino's sparkling, rousing and very charming score is one of my personal favourite scores of the year so far, and every bit as great as his score for Up.A superb job was done with the script here too, the comedy is clever and witty without ever being forced and balances subtly with the drama, the drama is some of the most truly poignant of any Pixar film and it doesn't ever feel manipulative or overdone and it's very smartly insightful. The story, not one of THE most innovative concepts but is one of the more imaginative uses of it and is quite original for Pixar actually, goes at a slightly steadier pace than other Disney films, but still captivated. It was very easy to completely connect with Riley and her situation and this was easily the Pixar film since Toy Story 3 that I connected with emotionally the most, also one of Pixar's most moving stories quite easily.Loved the characters too, Anger, Fear, Disgust and Bing Bong (the imaginary friend and the 'epitome of immaturity', without ever being annoying, his back story did bring a tear to the eye) stole every scene they were in, and even Sadness managed to crack some funny one-liners even in her depressive state. Joy also positively lights up the screen and Riley was easy to connect with and much more than just a stereotypical teen girl. The voice acting is splendid. Amy Poehler is note perfect as Joy with her spirited banter giving the character so much life while also bringing a human element to her as well, Lewis Black gives an explosively barn-storming turn as Anger, Phyllis Smith is amusing and affecting, Bill Hader and Mindy Kaling are similarly priceless and in a way that makes the characters of Fear and Disgust endearing rather than annoying, Richard Kind is innocently charming and Kyle MacLachlan and Diane Lane are appropriately compassionate.Overall, a masterful return to form for Pixar. It's their best since Toy Story 3 and one of their best overall as well. 10/10 Bethany Cox","

"INSIDE OUT","Michael_Elliott","28 November 2010","Inside Out (2015) *** 1/2 (out of 4)Eleven-year-old Riley has a wonderfully fun childhood thanks to the emotions working inside of her. Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) all help keep the young girl moving forward but when her family moves from Minnesota to San Fransisco it throws everyone for a loop and soon Joy and Sadness find themselves lost in her system and trying to find their way back.INSIDE OUT is certainly another winner from Pixar who are clearly the experts of the family movie. What really amazes me about the studio is that they're actually just making adult movies that kids happen to enjoy because of the pretty characters on the screen. I say this because films like this one, UP and WALL-E really do have adult stories dealing with adult issues yet somehow the studios are able to keep kids entertained while their parents get a lot more of the jokes and the emotions that the story provides. This one here is an incredibly touching story from a parent's point of view simply because of the changes that their kids go through.There's no doubt that the animation is the star of this picture and we're really treated to some wonderful images. I especially loved the use of colors in the picture and how various colors had a certain emotion attached to it. This is certainly excellent once our adventure begins as there's a ""long term memory"" section where these wonderful color marble like things are collection. Just the site of this are a true treat for the eyes. All of the ""emotion"" characters are perfectly brought to life with both Joy and Anger really standing out. The human characters are also quite entertaining and there's no doubt that the Bing Bong character will go down as a favorite decades from now.As I said, this film is going to work a lot better for older kids and adults as I'm sure the majority of young children aren't fully going to grasp the idea of emotions and how they effect our lives. The story itself is quite charming throughout and I was surprised at how many adult issues they were able to work on throughout the running time. Fans of Pixar are certainly going to love this as it's another winner that manages to work no matter what your age is. Still, I think the older you are the more you'll enjoy it.","

"INSIDE OUT","matthewssilverhammer","13 December 2010","After some ho-hum years and too many sequels, Pixar is back and better than ever with Inside Out, a boldly unique animated film that renews our faith in what a giant studio can do with an original concept. Docter combines the strengths of his two Pixar masterworks here: the endless inventiveness of Monster's Inc. and the poignant strength of Up. A truly fantastic mixture of fantasy-adventure-comedy and small-family-drama, it's a genius work of conception, execution and emotion that will go down in the annals of Disney animation as an instant and enduring classic. It follows Joy, the leading-emotion of an 11-year-old girl, as she tries to navigate a big change in her young life. Much like Toy Story 3, we're shown the inherent difficulties of growing up through a fresh viewpoint, learning what makes you ""you"". It's a convoluted idea that's nearly impossible to explain, and yet Pixar nails it, perfectly shifting between its parallel universes with ease. The humor throughout will undoubtedly have kids and adults in equal stitches, with fantastic turns from everyone, notably Poehler, Smith, Black, and Kind. However, this film's high-point may be the multiple emotional gut-punches that will reduce parents to tears. That fearlessness to be gloomy is basically the thesis of the film: true joy comes when every emotion is allowed to be recognized and dealt with healthfully. It's quite a psychologically complex stance to take for a film that manages to be so kid-friendly. This wonderful balancing act helps make Inside Out worthy of the ""M"" word (masterpiece) and gives it the distinction of being Pixar's best since the unparalleled Toy Story.","

I gave it a shot anyway and I didn't expect to love it--but it's depth absolutely shocked me. Not only is it a whimsical, funny film, but the poetry is off the charts.The creators of this film truly remember what it was like to be a child and continue to express understanding to children's feelings today. Riley is a light hearted little girl on the cusp of adolescence, approaching that turbulent age where everything changes and it seems like there is no one there to help you.Riley's emotions are portrayed using colorful creatures inside her head. Joy has been the ringleader of the emotions up until now, but Riley's life changes are starting to shake things up and Sadness has begun to take over. Truly amazing how this was depicted! Absolutely brilliant.As a kid, adults are often dismissing your emotions and never listening to you when you need them most. Often times kids cannot express themselves and turn to anger, panic or disgust, all emotions that will only heighten your problems as Riley comes to learn.When Joy finally lets Sadness take the reins and Riley opens up to her parents and they actually LISTEN to her...it is breathtaking.Don't miss out on this movie, definitely a must see! Amazing voice cast, beautiful visuals and a wonderful message to people of all ages.","

"INSIDE OUT","Giacomo_De_Bello","25 November 2010","94 minutes of pure joy and emotion. A return to masterclass from pixar and not only that, probably their best work outside of Toy Story 1 and 2. This film does deserves every bit of praise it has got and more. I will say without hesitation that if you haven't seen this film, believe me you should.Lets just start easy by saying that the animation is something other-wordily. We are beyond the point where anyone needs to express the fact that pixar's animation is gorgeous, but the fact is this animation is some of the most intelligent and dense animation I have ever seen. There are easter eggs in every single frame and more than that every visual element in the movie is well rounded and clearly thought out which makes the storytelling so much more gripping. Talking about storytelling, rarely does a film do visual storytelling so brilliantly. Five minutes into the movie I was in and I knew how things were rolling. This s really a lesson on how to think things out visually and how to use visuals to your advantage as much as it is possible, combining them to smart, engaging ideas.And now to the layers the film has. The deepness of its themes, the intelligence of its story, the subtext behind every action and word, the comedic touches, the insanely funny pop culture references, the poetic approach to joy and sadness, the emotional depth, everything, I'm telling you everything here is gut wrenching. There isn't one scene where you feel time is being wasted, there isn't one word a character speaks that doesn't feel genuine, there isn't one idea that is boring or unoriginal. This film is beyond emotionally engaging, this film gives you a mirror on which to reflect your life and think about it, but no wait it doesn't stop there, it also gives you the opportunity to laugh about it, that no matter what is going on there is also space for a laugh and for lightness. Wow.After a second viewing I have settled on the problem I originally had and can now honestly say this film really just has nitpick issues, it's truly a great one and definitely the best we've been given in 2015 so far. After my first viewing I was all enthusiastic about everything above, but I also was left a little confused by the mythology the film uses and wasn't quite sure it always fit. Upon a second viewing I guarantee that there is no such problem. The mythology is perfect and works with a solid and thought out logic that takes into account the chaos of life. What doesn't quite work is the fact that the film does have a few really minor shortcuts or conveniences that may stick out and I honestly wanted a little bit more of the control center room scenes and see some more of how it worked there, but then again I am really nitpicking.Incredible for me to say it, but I really want a sequel to this film, it's incredible. I want to see another two hours of the five emotions battling in out in the life of Riley and her further struggles, especially want to see the teenage years. This idea is truly amazing and special and it is so inspiring to me, I just really want a sequel to this film and that's the first time I've ever said that in my life.Trust me this film deserves every single bit of your attention and heart, it will take you on a roller-coaster of emotions and entertainment that is absolutely delightful and will also leave you thinking for days.","

"INSIDE OUT","planktonrules","14 January 2012","One important note: If you go see ""Inside Out"" be sure to get there on time so that you can see the short that precedes it, ""Lava"". It's an amazing short film--one of the best CGI shorts I've ever seen. But, like ""Inside Out"", its audience really is adults, not kids.This film appears to have been inspired by a now defunct but wonderful exhibit at Epcot at Disney World. Cranium Command was a strange movie which featured lots of film clips and audio animatronics to embody the various emotions battling within a young boy. Here in ""Inside Out"", you have a group of entities that also embody the feelings...but in a young girl. When the film focuses on these five emotions, it's at its best---clever, fun and often sweet and tender. Unfortunately, the film loses its way a bit in the middle--and seems to have succumbed to some distractions. Fortunately, it finds its way very well at the end-- and ending which is incredibly satisfying and perhaps might require some Kleenex.The film is incredibly well animated and I was impressed by the 3-D version as it used this technology well. Additionally, the story is nothing like any CGI film I've ever seen. My only reservation is that the story might be a bit difficult for children to understand and the plot seems much more for older kids, teens and, especially, adults.","

"INSIDE OUT","james-calver","24 November 2010","I am not normally one to write reviews, but I couldn't help reading several for this film on this site that just did't seem to understand where I think the film was supposed to be coming from.The majority of the complaints I saw were that the film was 'too depressing for a children's film', but whilst I see where they are coming from in some regards, every child who I have seen watch this film (I work in a cinema) has absolutely loved it, and laughed out loud almost constantly. They are not old enough to realise the message the film is trying to convey: that life isn't all about happiness. I applaud the attempt from Pixar to make a film that is not only hilarious in places, but is also a major comment on what life is like to be a younger teenager, transitioning through one of the most important moments of life. From a more personal perspective, why should everything we show our children gloss over the reality of life, and try to make them believe everything is rosy 24/7? Again, what this film does brilliantly through the message I took away at the end was that life will never be 100% full of happiness, but that is fine. Why does it have to be? A little bit of sadness is necessary. If a person was never sad, they would be inhumane. Overall then, I suppose my review is more of a comment on the type of film we exhibit to children, and how the Nanny-state we live in looks to protect them from most of lives inevitabilities. Either way, what can't be ignored is that this film is equal parts sad, and equal parts what I am sure will become a timeless classic in years to come.","

"INSIDE OUT","SquigglyCrunch","21 August 2012","Inside Out is the hit Disney-Pixar animated movie about emotions, specifically emotions living inside a person's brain in a somewhat human form and controlling how people react to things. It's an interesting concept, and for the most part it's presented well, but there are flaws for sure. The plot is, like I already said, interesting but flawed. It bothers me that people are saying that this is an incredibly original concept despite the fact that it's been done before. It's just the most popular use of the idea, but it's not the original. The story itself, however, has a handful of really good ideas, but there are inconsistencies with it too. The disappointing part is that most of the inconsistencies are actually pointless scenes that don't add to the story but instead end up taking away from it. There aren't a lot of them, but there's enough to take away from the movie itself. Most of the inconsistencies would spoil the movie, so you'll just have to watch it to understand. Other than that the ideas are good and some are even pretty amusing. The characters are okay. I found the most interesting characters to be the parents personally, with Riley being as flat as a pancake and everyone else just not being important enough to even remember by the time the credits roll. For a movie about emotion, Riley really isn't presented in a very realistic way. Sure, at times she's good, but most of the time her character is just inconsistent. The parents were, on the other hand, much more consistent, and funnier most of the time. I think that this movie had a great beginning and a great ending, it was just the middle stuff that struggled. It's a very emotionally intense movie, especially towards the end. I felt much more into the movie at these points, and even on my third watch I got a bit emotional about the ending. The movie felt a little too short as well, but maybe that's because I've seen it so many times already. Overall Inside Out is just good. I think that I loved it so much originally (I gave it a 10/10) because of the ending. It was pretty emotional the first time, but after the second watch I started to question it. By the third watch I found inconsistencies and a handful of things that I just didn't like about the movie. Ideas and such that just weren't nearly as good as I remember. In the end I'd still certainly recommend this movie, but if you want to really love it then don't analyze it, because otherwise you'll notice the things that I did (probably).","

"INSIDE OUT","RforFilm","5 March 2011","Inside Out may be the most cartoony story Pixar has released but it is also the most complex and mature. On the one hand, the majority of it is set within the mind of an eleven year old girl and her imagination, but the movie bears in mind (no pun intended) that the human brain is a complex organ that operates on many levels and circuits. The subconscious, abstract thought, memory and emotion all had to be given a physical form for Inside Out. Like a lot of people, I trust Pixar, yet didn't think that they had the talent to pull off something as unique, but crazy as the idea intended. I like to think of my brain running like a computer with perfectly synthesized control in place that's ready to deal with the many problems of the real world as the machine is quick to place the right emotion in time. Not every emotion is correct, but with the right mindset, the solution eventually comes. Everyone thinks differently and I wouldn't have been surprised if the film's focus picked a different approach. Inside Out also presents a human mind that does run like a machine, but actually gives a personality to each emotion to run it. A girl named Riley is living happily with her family in Minnesota. Her goofy and friendly personality is thanks to the emotion that runs her the most, Joy (played by Amy Poehler). She works with the other emotions, Fear (played by Bill Hader), Anger (played by Lewis Black), Disgust (played by Mindy Kaling), and not so much with Sadness (played by Phyllis Smith) to ensure that Riley remains that happy kid she is. But as with life, every kid has to come to their first big event that begins their journey into a full human. In this case it's a move.Riley's family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco, and the emotions are having a hard time figuring out the best reaction. Joy would like to continue for Riley to stay happy, but Sadness starts to have the effect of changing past memories from happy to sad. A fight between Joy and Sadness causes them to be sent to long term memory, leaving the other emotions to run Riley. The child clearly has trouble adapting to the big city life and starts to shut herself out, even considering running away. Joy and Sadness must get back to headquarters to fix Riley, but Joy may not know what's best for everyone. Like Toy Story, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo and Up, Inside Out is a buddy trip story that works because of it's leads. Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith make a great time that work off of each other well. It's not just these two as all folks casted are well known comedians that are well placed in their roles. It kind of reminded me of The Lego Movie, but while that was meant to be a full comedy, Inside Out is one of the biggest emotional journeys ever put on screen.I would love to see the writing process that this movie went though as both stories (the real world and the world inside Riley) connect and play so well that either could operate on their own, but they still need each other. Riley represents that hard part of childhood when they discover that the world is such a big place that we all go through what she did; fear about what could happen to us, disgust at what we don't understand, anger when things go wrong, sadness when we are at our lowest, and joy when we finally realize that things can still go well even after all of that.I'll give this five happy memories out of five. Pixar has officially returned to form! Inside Out is the kind of movie that everyone will talk about for a long time; the kind of word of mouth that no one could ever buy; the one that kids will love the imagination from; the one that adults will find fascinating and emotional. Inside Out is a perfect movie and needs to be seen. It's not that you should consider watching this, but you NEED to see this.","

"INSIDE OUT","MuviFan73","26 November 2010","Inside out is movie about emotions. Various emotions depicted in the movie are joy, fear, disgust, anger and sadness. The movie is about a girl who grows up to 11 years of age and then faces, what we can say, her first major mental breakdown resulting in a sad core memory formation. This happens because of the reason they move from Minnesota to a new place. The dull phase of her life is gradually overcome as the movie progresses as she learns to handle emotions more nicely.A human brain consists of various parts. It's fair to say that activity in certain part is responsible for a specific emotion. The movie has portrayed it very nicely. Human brain is very complicated structure. How it works majorly remains a mystery. The work done in the movie is a great representation of available information. The movie shows how a human being matures in terms of his emotions. Its shown how the girl learns to handle multiple emotions in terms of memory.My personal favorite emotions(characters) go in order anger, fear, joy, disgust, and sadness. Anger being the most liked one. The movie is wonderful, great job done by creators. Fairly recommended.","

"INSIDE OUT","Radu_A","23 October 2010","A young girl's five emotions try to solve her identity crisis caused by moving, but when the wrong levers in brain's control center are pushed, things go awry. That synopsis made me push watching this further and further ahead to, but I loved Docter's masterpiece ""Up"" so I had to watch this in a theater while I still could. Me and my partner thought, well, not really expecting much, so it will probably be OK. But oh what a disappointment it was. OK, I admit we are not teens. And love Japanese animation. And I do not appreciate Disney because of their marketing bonanza and ill-fitting gender stereotypes. But this film is so chock-full of fantasy-killing and misguided ideological messages that I am flabbergasted. It is beyond me how so little viewers find offense with the messages, and that these are thoroughly inappropriate for kids. Like for instance: 1) You are not in control of your emotions, your emotions control you. 2) Thought and reason have no influence at all on your decisions. 3) If you do not keep your emotions in check, you will lose your memories. If you lose your memories, you will become emotionally unresponsive. 4) There is only one good emotion (joy). There are four negative ones (sadness, anger, disgust, fear). That is it. That is what everyone feels. To hell with love. Or desire. Or curiosity. Or faith. 5) In order to grow up, your joyful memories have to become sad memories. Why? Good question. That is the climax of the movie and there is no explanation why this should be the case.None of this makes any sense. The whole plot is completely incoherent. These messages hold no educational value whatsoever. And strangely this seems to be more obvious to children than to adults - I heard a boy asking his parents what any of that was supposed to mean. This is obviously made and marketed for tech-savvy young parents who think they should take their kids to something more ""challenging"" than ""Planes 2"". The parents look like what an ad exec at Disney imagines Google employees to look like - mom wears cute specs, dad a hipster beard and it is set in San Francisco on top of that. The whole thing is probably the most in-your-face marketing device posing for a movie that I have ever seen. And everybody seems to be literally buying it.Well, not everybody. Some of the reviewers here do have similar issues, so all is not lost for the human race. If you care for an alternative story about a girl away from home struggling to adapt, there is the fantastic new Ghibli feature ""When Marnie was there"". That film has everything ""Inside Out"" has not: a story, believable characters, imagination, mystery, and most importantly: heart.","

"INSIDE OUT","PipAndSqueak","24 November 2010","OK, playtime's over Pixar, now get over it. This film is so plainly a prequel – c.f. references to a 'puberty' button on the new 'emote' console in the character Rileys brain - you will fail to find anything of entertaining value for your 100 minute investment. You may harbour fond memories of Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and Ratatouille – all unique, funny, thrilling and entertaining. But, that is not what you will get with Inside Out. 'Joy', after all, is banished to long-term memory and can't get back in charge of the console. (Since when was a single emotion ever 'in charge' anyway?). Inside Out can be taken as a metaphor for the poor sops who work for the Disney Corporation. Yes, they started out with true optimism about the life journey they had chosen, (with Pixar). Then, all of a sudden they are 'taken over' by a less than friendly peer. To compound this, they are moved from their original 'playpen' to a new post industrial work lot. All is grim. Sadness takes hold and taints everything that is done. Even 'Joy' begins to sob with sadness and grief. Save us from this self-indulgent misery. Not only is it inappropriate as kiddie oriented movie fodder, those of us who are sentient, self-aware adults can do without this additional mock unhappiness. By the way, most human brains have a 'fat controller' who orchestrates proceedings keeping everything on an even keel – even if that is 'sadness' for a while. Riley's brain seems to be lobotomised – even before puberty has hit. Give this film a wide berth, in fact, it might be best if someone scuttles this ship before the pestilence it's carrying spreads.","

That might have worked once but at this point you're overdoing it.I think this one was rushed and not as well worked out as previous installments by pixar and I do hope they find they're way again and return to the classics we all know and love.Re-animate.","

"INSIDE OUT","Theraxorterminate","24 November 2010","(WARNING THERE COULD BE SOME BRIEF SPOILERS!)Okay seriously you guys what has been going on with IMDb lately? Has it been hacked for real? Or is there some sort of ""Hate-group of Movies"" that helps the negative reviews to be read just so we won't watch this movie? Before I was able to see this movie I refused to read any reviews here especially the negatives. And I can honestly say that I am extremely baffled to see how many negative reviews around here is on the top of usefulness! Was this movie seriously that bad? Is this really PIXAR's worst movie out there? And my answer to that is simply: No not at all! And I will tell why this isn't a bad movie.Now I don't want any rant here as much as everyone else don't and I know most people hate ""defenders"" of certain movies but you know what I might as well be going to perform both of those things right now just so you get the idea why ""Inside Out"" isn't a bad movie.First I do have a question to those who didn't like this movie: Have you totally forgotten how good a PIXAR movie usually presents? Yes I know it's been a long time since we had a remotely good Pixar movie, I wasn't impressed of Cars 2 and I despised Brave too (and I still think today it's an awful movie that didn't deserve its Oscar) although I didn't dislike Monsters University as much everyone else did but true it could have been better. And now 2 years without a Pixar movie we finally got to see their next feature ""Inside Out"" and I can honestly tell everyone that this is not only the best Pixar movie since Toy Story 3 it's also their most ""personal"" movie so far.Now as much as I love watching Disney movies from WDAS I still love watching Pixar movies for their own unique presentations. Ever since ""Ratatouille"" they've had such unique ways for presenting unusual storytelling with the characters and the stories but still manage to be beautiful, likable and well-crafted without even messing up with annoying corny humor that ruins the important moments. And for a long time it finally got that craft after watching this movie and it also returned my love for Pixar again.Now I do not want to go with deeper details about the characters since I think now most know how these characters was presented, but if I'd like to talk about something a little different I would love to ask again to those who didn't like the film about the ""perfect"" girl Riley. Could you at least describe what's so ""perfect"" about Riley. And what did you else expect? A poor or rich girl? Or a stereotype? Riley's a fine character and I was happy to see how Pixar managed to create their own girl without ever putting in stereotypical appearances for her and that's a plus. She isn't extremely girly or a spoiled brat either and to me she's one of the most original characters Pixar have created. Though I do wished we could have gotten a little more screen time with her.I won't spoil the message but it is another big thing Pixar has given us this year. And I can tell that I was really worried if there ever were going to be a ""good"" message in this movie, and yet it does. I honestly can't see what makes it ""too dark"" for the children to understand it and as I said before this really is PIXAR's most personal movie so far and I'm not lying about this, I felt how a little tear from me wanted to get out when the movie was almost over. I think this year could be their most important message they've delivered us and I am very thankful to Pixar for showing us that. Oh and also the humor in the movie, did I tell you how enjoyable the humor in the movie was? I almost couldn't breathe in some parts and yes it was that funny it had a good balance of their usual Pixar humor with some very witty small jokes that appeared at times. Comedy movies have really disappointed me for the past years but I really had a great time with ""Inside Out"" I'd even dare to say this movie is even funnier than most newer comedy movies.One last but not least thing to say: I really had a good time watching Inside Out and the audience loved it too and at the very end of the movie (it's not always this usual for my home country and this was no exception) everyone applauded and so did I and I frankly believe it deserves the credit it receives. And I'm just going to go ahead and say that I think it should be about time that an animated movie should win for Best Picture next year. No I'm 100% serious about this and I wouldn't be surprised at all it would make me very proud of the Oscars to pick this one as the winner. And hopefully can finally change the minds of millions of people who still believes that animated movies are just for children, and hopefully it ends soon when they see Inside Out.","

It's bright, colourful and full of life on every level, you'd need to be made of stone not to enjoy it.Pixar know exactly what they're doing, they make us laugh and well up, it's a great film, so imaginative. The last animation I saw that made an impact was Up, this did exactly the same.

"INSIDE OUT","CubsandCulture","6 December 2010","This film is very frustrating because it is so close to being a wonderful experience that ranks among the very best Pixar. But the concept is just not suited to a longer narrative film-especially one that is intended to be a bittersweet comedy. The emotion-people are driving around us people-people is a funny, striking concept. The film flashes brilliance repeatedly by using this concept logically. Lewis Black as Anger is some of the best casting of all time. But alas the film doesn't work. I believe the following three conceptual problems are what do the film in.First Riley is not a real character in the film because Riley is not the seat of consciousness-Joy is. (This is true for all human ""characters"" and their dominate emotions.) This means that the story of Riley adjusting to moving to San Francisco rings entirely hollow because Riley is a mere automaton. She feels *nothing* only her emotion-people do. (The film's conception of how emotions work is *really* hard to work out the details.)Second, Joy and the other emotion-people are basically stuck in whatever emotion they are or cause. I.e. Joy is joyful, Fear is fearful, etc. This ends up causing two problems: the characters can be annoying because conceptually they are stuck in a single mode. Joy-being the main character-suffers the most from this. She is too chirper and it is grating. People might differ on this and find say Sadness too morose. Second, the emotion-people should not be able to feel emotions besides they one they are. Joy is Joyful and she should be unable to feel anything else at all.This brings me to the third conceptual problem. The film cheats on the last point and allows the emotion-people to have emotions besides the one they are. Joy for example *feels* sadness. This is because drama requires characters to change through time-this is why I think the concept is better suited to a short. However, this utterly undermines the explanation of where emotions come from that is the basis of the film. Either Joy herself has five emotions in *her* head to control *her* emotions or the emotion-people feel emotions as brute fact. In either case it does not work as an explanation; you either get an infinite regressions (it's emotions in heads all the down!) or there is no explanation for the emotion-people emotions beyond brute fact but in that case why no simply say humans feel as brute fact?The last point might seem like I am taking the film too literally. Perhaps I am but even as metaphor I find the conceptual problems to much to stomach. I simply cannot suspend my disbelief and go with the film. It is more perplexing and ill-considered the more you look at it.","

The result is a mess: not only is it not 'fun', it's also constantly shoehorning painful exposition mechanism by having characters explain what's on screen.I just don't see kids below 10 enjoying this in the least. And as an adult, there are better ways to learn about psychology than watching an animated film.Utterly bizarre.","

"INSIDE OUT","PennyReviews","22 January 2011","Inside Out is the story of how emotions work in our minds (in a girl's mind to be precise). The emotions, Joy and Sadness, wonder around the girl's mind, aiming to find a way back to the controlling room where they can help her through a big change in her life. The story is interesting, but it gets boring towards the end, as the one twist follows the other. Joy is a control freak, dictating every emotions' move and pretty much dominating the girl's mood. Other than that, and the overjoy-full mood, Inside out is funny and entertaining. The colours are vivid and the action enough to make a good movie. But I guess the whole control room, memories, dreams etc etc are kind of confusing, with all the islands and the maze. So 3 out of 10.","

"INSIDE OUT","ironhorse_iv","20 January 2011","Don't be close-minded. Open your mind to new things, like this movie. It's worth-checking out. Directed by Peter Docter, the movie tells the story of a group of emotions in a little girl's head, trying to deal with a tough, life-changing event. While, the emotions; Joy (Voiced by Amy Poehler), Sadness (Voiced by Phyllis Smith), Anger (Voiced by Lewis Black), Fear (Voiced by Bill Hader), and Disgust (Voiced by Mindy Kaling), want to make the best, out of it; things start to unravel for Riley Anderson (Voiced by Kaitlyn Dias), as her emotions find, that growing up is more difficult, than it seems. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, that this movie is more than a feeling. It's well-crafted animation. Still, there are things in the film that I can nitpick about. While, this isn't really a bad thing, I believe the movie might be a little too sophistication for certain younger audiences. I like how the movie is challenging kids to understand, their own brains, but the movie kinda leaves, some kids confused. Maybe, it need a bit more explanation about what's going on, since there are so much references to Trait theory, abstract thought, Cognitive neuroscience, and the subconscious that kids haven't yet, understood. The humor kinda blends, the same way. You have to be very observed to get some of the jokes here. Jokes like how opinions and facts often get mixed up on the train of thought, might fly pass you, if you're not paying attention. It's very smart, clever, and sublime. Not only is the movie full of mindful jokes, but the movie is the brim with throwbacks to Pixar's previous films, some of them obvious, some of them so hidden in the background that a deeper perceived might be needed. I like all the oddball sequences that the film had to offer. Places like Dream Production, Imaginationland, and Subconscious were pretty cool to see. The world in which, the character live in, is so unique. What a beautiful mind. I love it! I love, every character in this film. The voice acting is amazing. Each one of them, gave a lot of depth to their character. The story is very heart-felt. There are a lot of tear-jerking moments. So, make sure, to bring some tissues! ""Take her to the moon for me, okay?""- I was really crying when that moment came. While, the movie is PG, there are a few scary moments that might be a little too scary for small children. Watch out for Mr. Jangles! I love, how the movie deals with a lot of complex things, such as intertwined relationship in parenthood, camaraderie and friendship. Other things that the movie dealt with, is the heartbreaking realization, that the transience of time will inevitable, lead to more complicated feelings, that parents need to be aware, of. One of the most potent about the movie is learning to accept the undeniable encroachment of Sadness into your life. While, it's good to keep a relentless optimism mind. It's not a bad thing, to feel sad or depress when you need it. Empathy is very important and poignant emotion to have. That's heavy! Neuroscientists were consulted to help make the film's settling of an eleven year girl's brain, very believable and I believe, it's very close to how a young mind, might work. Director Peter Docter got the idea for the project, from his daughter. He always wonder, what was going through her mind. So, he created this movie, using it as an allusion/representation of him as a father watching his own daughter go through emotions like those; that Riley had to deal with. While, a lot of critics, are saying, this movie is very original. I have to say, not really. After all, Peter Docter pretty much copy the concept from his previous work on Cranium Command, the Walt Disney Epcot attraction about the human body and watching earlier Disney short films, like 1943's Reason and Emotion. While the movie isn't that original. The movie moves in a very logically pace. Still, there were a lot of head-scratching moments that made me wonder: What were, they thinking? One of them, is how Sadness and Joy couldn't find their way, back to the Headquarters. There were many good examples of ways, Sadness and Joy could make their trip to HQ, a lot easier, such as using Bing Bong's wagon or recall. Both were establish, way early on in the film, but barely use, until late into the film. Honestly, it would have work, better than the odd Deus Ex Machina trampoline that they found. Another thing that people asking questions is how other people in the film usually have all of their emotions match their gender, but not Riley's. There is a possible explanation to this. While, Riley is a girl with a unisex name. She's a tom-boy, so it wouldn't be, too surprising that she would have two male emotions. I really doubt, she is a transgender, but who knows. I think her mind is bit young, so she still possibly figuring her emotions and identify out. With time, maybe, she also will have emotions adequate to her own basic template. Another thing is while, there is a huge variety of emotions, I think the emotions, they picked, work the best. While the movie is full of familiar Pixar tropes and clichés. I'm glad, that Pixer is back, where they belong. It's was very worrisome, for a while. I really didn't like those lackluster, strategic sequels that they kinda put out, a few years ago. Overall: I really love this movie. I haven't met one person that hate this film, yet. You really have to out of mind, if you hate it, because the movie delivers in every way! So don't live with Anhedonia! Go see this movie! It's worth watching! It's mind-treat!","

So I marvel at what they made work here and how deeply illuminating of life with such simple pieces, toys essentially. I believe it will go far in estimation. It's not intellectual - but it's driven by surpassing intellectual ability. It's inspirational - but colors everything on the way out with something that goes beyond ""inspiration"". We have the animated ride about overcoming obstacles to be there for someone, the ride is great fun, the vistas imaginative; a lot of care went into making the inner architecture simple in textures and ""locations"", with childlike order. But the ride is transferred inside the mind of a little girl and they begin to build something else there. Five emotions inside the heroine's head vying for controls of life, directing a ""movie"". External reality seen through screens and ""cameras"" that project cinematic light that carries memory. Memories stored in gleaming orbs that contain them. Colors associated with emotions. All this very simple, it goes without saying, that in other hands or other contexts it would appear reductive.But the way it simplifies complex life inside the heroine's head to simple essentials that we can accept as building material for ours, how well they tied inner and outer so that I found myself nodding every time the bumbling ""emotions"" translated as believable behavior outside - all the different pieces come together by the end to form such a strong mechanism, simple without feeling like we have missed any nuance in the process. And all this as someone's soul at stake.So far so good, fun, vibrant, intelligent. Maybe the best Pixar already. And then they turn the gear once more and color everything - it's one of the most poignant endings I've seen, it floored me and I'm someone who doesn't give to just anyone the power to touch me.It illuminates - a happy memory only possible because of a sad one that preceded and these as part of the same flow - sadness that must touch all things - sadness that is joy and vice versa - multiply colored orbs now, each one a small gem of inferred ambiguous life. Each one a simple piece by itself. It has created a simple order in the soul, torn it and created another, simple but richer. With other animation films, we lose too much of our nuance in the process of simplifying, not here. The apogee is the lasting impression of seeing myself. Reflections released from their orbs and allowed to float would have a farflung (Malickian) view. But it's what we put into them from our ""orbs"" that lets us see. We would like our inner murk to be this simple so we accept it and are better off for it, nurturing our ability to see ourselves simply. To simplify complex things without losing their complexity is an utmost art. How much more so the art of simplifying ourselves without losing our complexity?","

The idea itself seems to great that you do wonder how no one has made something as beautiful as this up until now. But Pixar proves again, that even though the idea might be out there, it is able to make it work on so many levels with the layers attached.Giving feelings a face and make them react a certain way is amazing. Giving them a way to grow and learn as if they were humans just adds to that whole thing. There is so much going on here, that it would take too many words and space to go into detail of it all. But all that and the message is still packed in a movie that is also entertaining and funny. Something Pixar movies have succeeded in doing for quite some time now ...","

"INSIDE OUT","mohan59","25 July 2012","For some reason, I couldn't quite catch this movie in theaters and I managed to watch it on an international flight. And boy, am I glad I did! As far as concepts go, I was astonished at the amount of detail and coherence in execution. The visuals are absolutely stunning, the colors rich and vibrant, the characters utterly memorable and some of the most poignantly heart-breaking lines of dialogue ever spoken/sung in any movie, let alone feature animation. It is every bit a Disney-Pixar classic and as emphatic a return to form as it can get.The story revolves around a young girl child who is happy in her world and has to suddenly acclimatize to another environment when her family has to move. Growing pains and social issues affect her while she grapples with increasingly complex situations, both at home and school. Meanwhile, the interplay between the five primary emotions inside her mind is both dynamic and fraught with compromises, much like how we deal with others everyday. As things come to a head and young Riley is about to make a life-changing decision, the events that follow leave a lasting impression, with an increased appreciation of the phrase ""emotions are what makes us human""! I recognized some dichotomies - for instance, Minnesota, usually perceived cold, is regarded as warm and comforting by Riley while San Francisco, renowned for its sunny weather, is seen as foreign and unwelcome. The other contrast I noticed was all five emotional figures (Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust) do not always stay true to form, with Joy especially exhibiting nuances far beyond what her name implies - case in point, her touching admission preceding the last act (that entire sequence was too much for my eyes to take, by the way). All this might be considered a tad too much for young children to appreciate, but with time, they may probably realize how beautifully honest this movie was in trying to portray their growth and the underlying issues.Certainly, it is not without flaws: the plot meandered a bit 2/3rds into the length; Joy's ""A-ha"" moment seems strangely contrived, despite the impact it had; the music was adequate but not truly captivating as in the case of other Pixar offerings. But the beauty of this medium is that it offers filmmakers opportunities to steer audiences to more engaging experiences; Pete Docter and Co accomplish this with aplomb.In terms of cast and crew, the voice actors are superb selections - Lewis Black aces the Angry persona with generous dollops of sarcasm; Mindy Kaling is just perfect voicing Disgust; Richard Kind's performance as the imaginary Bing Bong is an absolute tear-jerker, while Kaitlyn Dias shows remarkable poise playing Riley. But it is Amy Poehler who steals the show in a coruscating blend of vivacity, vibrancy, and vicariousness. Her Joy is not an infallible leader, but one who accepts others in the face of challenging situations and plows ahead with inspiring positive energy. The animation left me spell-bound, especially the sequence where thoughts are shown to be abstracted, and are endowed with a lot of heart. The movie is fairly short, but a running time of 94 minutes is appropriate justice to a slightly heavy subject matter. The humor compensates with trademark Pixar staple of jokes, albeit intended for slightly more mature viewers. Pete Docter gave us the outstanding Up six years ago and ably accompanied by Ronnie del Carmen, has categorically demonstrated that he is a fabulous storyteller and a master entertainer.Inside Out is every bit a Pixar fan's well-deserved reward for patience. Do yourself a favor and watch this magnificent gem.","

"INSIDE OUT","ItalianBombshell","22 November 2010","I have never entered in such a poor review for a Disney film. I am always defending the ""Imagineers"" and their creative processes. I'm a Floridian..not a true Florida cracker, more of a saltine (or maybe a Triscuit). But, my love for all things Disney ended with Inside Out. The premise was really great, in concept, but extremely poorly enacted. So, yeah, OK, you've got your emotions, ""Joy, Anger, Sadness, Disgust, etc...."" Yeah, it's that bad. An etc. Do I really need to say more? Well, of course, there's more. Riley is THE perfect girl. But really, what she is, is sheltered. A good family. Parents that worship her. A core group of friends and education, extracurricular activities, etc. Yeah, another etc. Societal norms and morés dictate that this is really not the case. Having both parents, let alone both parents being married, is an event these days. Sure, we'd all love to believe that those idyllic family structures still exist. But, truly, ask your children, it isn't even close. So, let's go ahead and move this ""perfect"" family, because of Dad's job (yeah, cuz that's an original storyline) and plunk em down in Cali from Minnesota. Disney/Pixar's attempts to poke fun at Vegan lifestyles to get the viewer closer to the family is pretty weak. As is the whole system of forming and processing memories. Leading us all to believe that joy is the most powerful and important emotion. When, in the end, sadness rules the roost. Ummmm, what? All ""core memories"" are formed by sadness and touched by joy. Please. The disconnect between the emotions and the girl is huge. Watching a movie that is supposed to be happening inside this girl is confusing. Riley's actions are so delayed that is clear that we're all watching minutes of dialogue before she reacts. It's distracting. Not to mention pretty lame. It seems Disney/Pixar kinda realized this and decided to showcase Riley's emotions while she was asleep. Believable. Mmhhmm. Yeah, ummmm, no. Throw in a couple of distracted parents and stress, not even real stress, a kind of implied stress, and they're you have the whole basis of the film. Pretty shaky. I saw this film with an 11 and 12 year old. Both girls Riley's age. Now, granted, these girls have great families...but they also have mothers going through terminal illness and fathers that work their trails off to make ends meet. So their emotions run high. But they aren't cry prone girls. And yet, here we were, popcorn, candy, sodas for breakfast watching this horrible film. Both girls in tears and a very well placed f-bomb by yours truly to lighten the mood. Bottom line? 90 minutes of confusing, sad, disjointed dialogue and about 5 minutes of happy. Never a laugh out loud. Maybe a smile. Maybe. So, ummmm, what the hell Disney/Pixar? This the trend? If so, take me back to it being a small small world. It's way better than drilling these fake boyfriend thoughts of being our savior into our daughter's head. First were waiting for ""our price to come."" Now we're relying on fake boyfriends? Please. How about a girl that can handle herself, her school, her family, and be strong? Not this lame nonsense.","

It is by far worse than if they were to try to hide pornography into a children's film.This movie would be more suited as a training video for beginning psychology students. This movie is not about emotions. It is purely about a spoiled child that snaps because her family moves.This is a movie trying to put a fresh look on child psychosis, that attempts to put flashy images and colors on the screen to trap the impressionable child, and at the same time, give parents a horribly skewed kindergarten education on their children's bratty behavior.","

But the story amounted to what appeared to be a high end PBS type educational public service announcement about getting to know the workings of the mind and emotions but in the most micromanaged, compartmentalized, explain the obvious so much it distracts from the real story and that being a bit sappy and contrived one at best. ""Implied"" was not on the screenwriter's mind when they penned this story.I mean I had to struggle keeping track of the differences of short term memory vs long term in the form of glowing orbs distinguished by various colors. I felt like I needed to take notes on the symbols representing stages of childhood emotional growth such as the ""goofy"" stage. YIKES! Everything that was explained lost its entertainment impact that I was left wondering why or which I should pay attention to, the story? the characters? or how the brain works? I chose none of the above and walked out of the theater.","

"INSIDE OUT","texxas-1","10 December 2011","The trailer was so misleading. It portrayed the film as funny, but this film is anything but. It starts off where 11 year old Riley moves from Minnesota to California which she is unhappy about. She gets to the gloomy grey house in a gloomy grey street and you feel her depression and disappointment. It was California but there was no sunshine to speak of. You wouldn't expect this kind of bleakness in a film aimed at young people let alone children. The film barely gave Riley any screen time and spent most of the time on emotions Joy and Sadness, who were both trapped outside brain headquarters and trying to get back. Sadness has to be the most annoying, unlike-able character. On the way they meet Bing Bong, Riley's old imaginary elephant friend. Seeing him cry because he's sad Riley no longer plays with him made me cry, but it gets worse, when he and Joy get trapped in a dump and both try to escape, they can't get out together because he's to heavy,so he let's her go alone, she looks back to see him disappearing into thin air while saying ""take Riley to the moon for me"". This was a Bambi sad moment. We never get reunited with Bing Bong and never see or hear from him again, this is such a downer, he was innocent,helpful and likable.There was one scene where Riley introduces herself to her new classmates and then bursts into tears because she didn't want to be there, I couldn't help but think this was an overreaction. Since Joy and Sadness were no longer in her mind she's only left with Disgust,Anger and Fear (these characters had nowhere near enough screen time and were much more entertaining than Joy and Sadness). She decides to steal money from her mother and run away back to Minnesota, but as soon as she's on the bus, Sadness and Joy have made it back to headquarters and Joy orders Sadness to do her work. Riley suddenly feels sadness and realising she'll miss her family changes her mind and runs back home. As soon as she sees her parents she starts crying and says she doesn't like living here. Her parents comfort her and the film ends there.So the moral of the story is its okay to cry and that all our emotions are important,even the bad ones. If Riley didn't feel sadness she would have never seen sense and went ahead with her stupid plan and probably end up being raped and murdered.Once the film is over you don't feel happy, nothing good really happened it was just wall to wall misery. Bing Bongs death, Riley being isolated from her parents, ditching her hobbies, losing her two important emotions, losing her old friends, hating her new house, eating lunch alone at her new school and running away. This is a Disney film right? Talk about putting bad ideas in children heads. After the film was over I felt sad for the rest of the day and night. I wish I never watched this.","

The beautiful colors and well developed art of Pixar is most often worth the cost of admission to me. But Inside Out is so awful it drove me and my significant other from the theater. The concept is much too heavy and involved to hold the attention of a child. Quickly obvious that this will not be a bit lighthearted and plummets into bleakness. Inside Out becomes doggedly repetitive, with the emotional balls in the air, flailing here and there. The characters in Pixar, have a noticeable sameness of facial features and gestures. ""Joy"" is reminiscent of other females from past movies. This time, the female lead is so over-the-top that, after a short while, I wanted to shout ""shut up and go away!"" I went to be entertained and have a laugh or two. I came away feeling that I'd been emotionally beaten up yet bored to tears. Leaving before the ending was actually with a feeling of relief at having escaped.","

"INSIDE OUT","zetes","1 February 2012","Amazingly complex animated film that builds the inside of an 11 year-old girl's mind as a fantastical world of wonder. Five basic emotions, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust, live inside the mind of Riley and are in control of her attitude and memories. Joy (Amy Poehler) has done a good job of leading the emotions up to this point, but when Riley's parents drag her to San Francisco for her father's job, Sadness (Phyllis Smith) becomes more powerful, much to Joy's chagrin. The metaphors Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen have created in this girl's mind are insanely clever. Very quickly you get a bit ahead of the film, understanding Riley's emotional responses and the inner workings of her mind before we see her, in real life, react. It actually gets so abstract at times I think I wouldn't recommend the film for younger children - it probably is meant more for children closer to Riley's age, and their parents (and adults in general) will probably get more out of it than any child will. There's a bit of a slapstick element, and, honestly, sometimes it feels a bit out of place. As one might expect, the animation is wonderful. The fantastical world is beautiful, but for me it was the characters who really stood out. Joy in particular is one of Pixar's all-time greatest characters, and she's perfectly performed by Poehler. This is definitely one of Pixar's best movies.","

I mean, what a let down.Joy is simply annoying. I tried to think that perhaps the character was bossy and pushy to show that happiness always tries to prevail but I just wanted the character to die in that pit of forgetfulness.And that's the best story the filmmakers could come up with? It's like they've run out of imagination! Maybe Pixar's problem is being part of Disney, which can churn out cookie-cutter movie after formulaic movie. I mean, you've got some of the best talent in the world and mountains of money, and yet you can't come up with a friggin' decent story! For this movie, the makers could have made ANYTHING happen in the brain, which is in itself an endless container of possibilities, and yet they chose to have the two main emotions wander around lost in memory storage for most of the movie. Perhaps Imagination Land in the movie represents the imagination of the filmmakers: it's puny and boring - French fries, a house of cards, an imaginary boyfriend. The place looked like some desolate Vegas amusement park about to be shut down. It was depressing.Then we start to see the parents' emotions but only a few times. You either do that consistently or you don't do it at all. And it seems adults would have more emotions than children. Anyway, it doesn't seem to make a difference. As an adult I couldn't be fooled by weakness of this movie, and I imagine kids would be bored and have no idea what's going on anyway.Two stars for visuals!","

For Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco, Riley is directed by her emotions, Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) in Headquarters Control Center inside Riley's mind to help her overcome everyday life. However, Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to Riley's new life in San Francisco and emotional disorder arises. Although Joy, Riley's main and most fundamental emotion, tries to keep things optimistic, the emotions fight on how best to navigate Riley's new world.After watching ""Inside Out"" with my wife, we both agreed that ""Inside Out"" is the perfect Pixar Animation movie for any family on a night out.

"INSIDE OUT","Marjeez","23 May 2011","Please excuse any mistakes as my English is not very good. There are no spoilers in this review.I had the pleasure of seeing 'Inside Out' at the Cannes Film Festival and I must say it was wonderful and a huge step-up from Pixar's recent efforts. The trailers don't really do it justice. The story may seem complicated for younger viewers, but the way Pixar tells the story fits for both adults and children. The pacing is in the vein of Wall-E, and in that sense it is very much a film for adults as it is for kids (like most Pixar movies). The story here is surprisingly raw and emotional, one that has very deep underlying themes that adults will connect with. Many of the audience members were crying at the end. It has one of the most original stories for an animation in the last few years, and I believe many people (especially adults) will form a connection to it.Speaking of animation, the film is breathtakingly beautiful. There is a nice contrast of colors that make it look vibrant, like Pixar's 'UP'. The voice cast did a wonderful job and you couldn't ask for better direction from Pete Doctor and co. I cannot wait to see this a second time with family and friends. Highly recommended.PS: The short that played before the film, 'Lava', was also beautiful. It was sort of a musical, and it was quite funny and clever. The audience even applauded at the end of it, myself included. In that sense, it provides the entire package a nice balance of joy and laughter (Lava) followed by deep storytelling and emotion (Inside Out).","

"INSIDE OUT","havenferrer","16 April 2016","Oh my god. This has to be the most misunderstood Pixar film ever created.
I never realized how much hate this movie had gotten until now, but, reading through the reviews, it just isn't justified.
All of these are parents complaining about it being too intense for young children, but, this film isn't for them. I found that it reached out to a completely new audience, one that Pixar hasn't really touched upon recently, and that is pre-teens and teenagers that suffer from depression.
I am now 14 years old, and this film came out at just the right time for me, when things were taking a turn for the worst. I was going through depression and suicidal thoughts for reasons that I don't want to talk about, around the time in which this film was released. I hadn't seen a disney film in quite a long time, and my little sister really wanted to see this one.
Looking at all the generally positive feedback, I decided to go see it with her.
The opening sequence was possibly one of the best Pixar had done since Wall-E. It was beautiful and cinematic, and just adorable. Riley had some pretty gorgeous facial expressions and detailing for an animation standpoint.
As the film moved on, I started to realize how well this film related to my life, and how well riley related to me as a character. Pixar was very subtle with it, but, managed to develop Riley's character so well, with her barely being on screen.
The characters themselves were shockingly complex, especially sadness and joy. (Joy has a brilliant character design, with blue eyes and blue hair which we'll get to later.)
The main plot basically revolves around a pre-teen going into a state of depression after moving to her new home, away from her friends, her hockey team.
Depression, in my experience, isnt what it says it is. To me, it is a complete lack of any feeling whatsoever. When joy and sadness basically lose control of riley for awhile, this perfectly captured the ""what is going on inside their head"" meaning at the beginning of the film. Joy and sadness are the two most important emotions, and riley didnt have them anymore. A complete lack of emotion, a state of depression.
The rest of the film after that was enjoyable, and a certain character whom I was almost sure going to be a twist villain after that monstrosity that was 'Frozen', turned out to be my personal favorite character in the film. Everyone's had some sort of imaginative personality growing up. I had one.
It helped me cope with stress, I talked to it when I was mad about something, and whenever no one seemed to want to talk to me for whatever the reason, she was always there. That's why Bing Bong's death was just so hard to watch, because of how painfully true it is. I guarantee that 99% of the people on earth have completely forgotten about their imaginative friends growing up. The thing is, he didnt die, he was completely forgotten. When you think about it, it seems so much worse than dying. After that, joy seems to have forgotten about him as well. He isnt mentioned ever again in the movie, but, I'm kinda okay with that. If the movie forgets about him, the audience does as well, which creates an illusion.
Now, let's talk about the ending.
When riley returns home to her worried parents, she seems emotionless. Then I realized something, a slow realization that happened throughout the final scene in the film.
True happiness cannot exist without sadness.
This realization is depicted in one of the most brilliant forms ever, mixed emotions. As riley is growing up and maturing, mixed emotions become apart of her and her core memories. This symbolizes maturity and complexity as you grow up.
This film got me to open up to my parents about my depression and anxiety, and I feel like I have matured just like riley did in the film. Pixar did a brilliant job as depicting our emotions, personalities, and maturity. I love this film so much, and it changed my life.","

"INSIDE OUT","TheSeaLion","1 February 2012","After seeing the trailer for ""Inside Out"", I was pretty keen to see it. The movie looked like it had a lot of good ideas and all of the people working on the project who I knew about I like. This should have been a great movie experience for me, but instead, it was a disappointment.After moving from Minnesota to San Francisco, eleven-year-old Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) has to adjust to a new life with the help of her emotions, Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling). When Joy and Sadness are accidentally purged from the control tower along with Riley's core memories, which make Riley Riley, the two have to find their way back. As Joy and Sadness try to do that, Fear, Anger, and Disgust are the only emotions Riley has left to control her.In their journeys through Riley's brain back to headquarters, Joy and Sadness come across Riley's imaginary friend Bing Bong (Richard Kind), who helps them find their way through Riley's brain. Bing Bong was not introduced at any point before his reveal, so he just shows up out of nowhere without any buildup or previous mention. Then, he becomes one of the most important characters of the whole movie.When it comes to the characters, most of them are understandably defined to one personality trait (happy, sad, scared, angry, etc.), but even the characters that aren't emotions don't have much personality to them. Riley has (as stated by the movie) five things that make her who she is, and the only one that really adds any personality is goof ball. Her parents (Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan) are blank slates, their emotions are blank slates who somehow don't even show their one emotion, and even Bing Bong lacks any real personality. Along with that, Joy's character arc makes little sense. She learns of Sadness's importance to Riley, but for all we know, Sadness has only done one thing right that helped Riley while Joy and the other three emotions controlling her seemed to be working for the most part. There was no lesson that really needed to be learned from the get-go of the story, because Sadness was only needed to solve the problem that she started in the first place.The story elements are a lot of the same things over and over again. Joy, Sadness, and Bing Bong try to get to the control center, but each time, their method of getting their is destroyed by the accidentally and unknowingly by an emotion or an exterior event, like Riley sleeping or the brain workers outside of abstract thought. Then, they have to try and find a way to start everything up again or find a new way to Riley's brain. It just goes on like that for an hour and thirty minutes.Granted, there were some creative elements to the movie and some genuinely funny and emotional moments, but they were overshadowed by the larger problems the movie had. I'd say this is the worst Pixar movie I have seen, even worse than ""Cars"", and a great disappointment.","

The ones I have not seen are Wall-e, Ratouttlie, Brave, Cars 2 and The Good Dinosaur. Most of the ones I seen were either great or not bad. My favourite Disney film is the Lion King followed by the Jungle Book (1967) and Pinocchio. But this film is one of the worst and boring Disney films I have ever seen!The film is about a little girl named Riley who moves to a new home in San Franscisco after her dad gets a new job and her mind is controlled by a group of creatures known as 'emotions' who get her through everyday life but two of them Joy and Sadness end up in the bowls of Riley's mind where old memories are stored and without them especially Joy Riley's life is misery at home and school.This film was just awful. This film may be family friendly but the film is nothing like a film for children. There is very little comedy and is more adult-themed than the other Pixar films. It is my opinion also that this film shares similarities to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Exorcist and The Land Before Time. Like in Snow White the emotions have names matching that of their personality. For example Joy is all happy and optimistic while Sadness is like Eeyore by being downright miserable. Like Regan McNeil of The Exorcist Riley is processed in her mind but by the emotions and not a demon named Pazuzu while her parents and presumably everyone in the film are also processed by emotions. The film's sub plot where Joy and Sadness try to get back to headquarters is a throwback to the Land Before Time where Littlefoot and his friends try to find the Great Valley. I also felt the film was rushed and none of the characters apart from Riley, Joy and Sadness get much screen time. Even Anger, Fear and Disgust hardly get involved in the film. Disgust arguably was the emotion who got demoted to extra.The film was as I said rubbish and how people loved this film has left me stumped. To me this film does not deserve a sequel as this film is just not good enough for one.","

"INSIDE OUT","sublimineyes","26 November 2010","I'd like to believe that someone came up with an intriguing idea with an interesting plot line and characterisations and that it simply had its life drained out of it by focus groups during development but however it all worked this is minimal dimensions formulaically dull.Who chose the emotions the kid has, why these specific ones, why this many, why don't they change as the kid grows, why go for mono colours in general (sadness, anger etc) but then throw this away with the other emotions, why imply to kids in the audience that life is mechancial, why no wonder, why, why, why?The voice talent chosen doesn't help. Simply flat, lacking distinction anywhere or real variety.The visuals are, well, again, formulaic. Standard mannerisms seen in countless other works, all served up in standard shapes, palette and textures.It all feels unfortunately like a Disneyfied version of a Pixar film.I found this about as dull an animation as I've seen in years and actually gave up within half an hour.","

"INSIDE OUT","Terastas","16 November 2010","No. This is not an original idea. It is a done-to-death movie idea. It was done by Herman's Head, by Osmosis Jones, and by almost every ""Fantastic Voyage"" episode of God only knows how many Saturday morning cartoons.And all of them, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM, did it better than Inside Out.First of all, the characters. They are QUITE LITERALLY ONE-DIMENSIONAL. Instead of opting for personifications of complex concepts like the id and the ego or conflicting mindsets idealist, the pragmatist and the narcissist, Pixar chooses to dumb the concept down as much as possible and gives us personified emotions.The setting? Yes, it's beautifully animated, but again: It's nothing we haven't seen done before and done better, both with a better interpretation AND with more humor.The plot? What plot?There is literally not a single original idea in this entire movie. Even the imaginary friend, which should have been where Pixar flexed their creative muscles the most, looks like something they stole out of the Jim Henson Wing of the Puppet Museum.So what does that leave? The countless ""Easter egg"" references to other Pixar movies. Which, more and more, seem less like things they thought would be fun to throw in and more like an endless barrage of reminders that. . .THIS IS PIXAR AND THAT MEANS YOU STUPID SHEEP ARE SUPPOSED TO LOVE THIS CRAP!!!!And it's that last point that ultimately pisses me off the most, because the sad fact is that they probably don't even need to badger their audiences into thinking this crap is not crap.If any animation company other than Pixar had come out with this crap, it would have tanked at the box office hard enough to close the studio. But because it's Pixar, it's cleaning up at the box office, being lauded over by critic after critic for the ""originality"" of ideas that were shamelessly stolen, and will very likely walk away with yet another undeserved Oscar for Best Animated Feature.No, this is not a great movie. This is freaking crap. And if we don't call this movie out for the freaking crap that it is and stop giving Pixar money, praise and accolades no matter what kind of crap they give us, we can forget about ever seeing movies anywhere near the same quality as Up, The Incredibles or WALl-E ever again.","

"INSIDE OUT","victornunnally","28 December 2010","I am sitting here watching this animated nightmare with my niece who seems to like the movie. I asked her; ""Is that it?...is that all the emotions they are presenting to you? Where is wisdom? Where is faith?"" The film is disturbing as it presents no magic to being a kid. It seems to play a lot on getting down in this world and reacting with anger and fear. Joy tries to rescue the mind but is being manipulated by outside forces trying to be goofy but lost in deception. I am not sure what this film is trying to suggest. I recall as a kid I use to have two characters in my head, little aliens, one good and one bad. They would do battle but good would win out each time. Yet, the little manipulative one would sometimes disguise himself as good. Yet, wisdom would come into play and I would send both aliens out of my head. Is Disney being operated by a cult? Each film dumbs the mind with eye candy tactics. Every time a Disney film ends my mind is left empty and my memory is void of emotion. Use wisdom and stay away from this warped garbage.","

Just saw it last night....and not once did anything peak my interest even for a minute. If any man likes this movie, I just wouldn't know what to say.It's just a bunch of emotion-cartoon-characters chasing emotion-balls around inside of the girl's head. Boring, annoying, and extremely childish movie. Sure a very small child might like it. Maybe women like the concept of these battling emotions. But for the average guy....trust me, it's of zero interest. It's not clever. It's very childish and intended for children 8 and under.","

Wrap it in Christmas paper and call it ""It's a wonderful life Jr."" Why would you drag yourself over emotional broken glass for this long in the hopes of a positive resolution? Do you find joy in hitting yourself on the head with a two by four, because you know that eventually the pain will stop, like when you pass out? We watched this thing and got two, count 'em two laughs. Not belly laughs, not guffaws, just mild chuckles. The rest was a harrowing, bewildering slide down into the depths of despair while trying to comfort children who were showing more and more signs of emotional distress. A waste of time and a waste of the talents involved.It just plain sucks.","

Given how much praise this film was receiving (let alone it's a Pixar film) I was hoping for a much smarter explanation of emotions.Also most other aspects of the film just weren't funny/enjoyable.","

"INSIDE OUT","supertrunks2","30 January 2011","I don't really side with the reviewers that say the idea of a movie like this would be lame. Because honestly, there'd be nothing better than taking your kid to see a movie that makes them think about how they work. Bright colourful visuals, lovable animals inside our head in a big mind world. It could have been so cool. However, this movie has NONE of that. It makes your inside of your head look like a stupid office worker's counter, what gives?If this were done in the 90s, we would have had a HUGEEEEEE story about jaguars and cheetahs and fish and stuff in our mind. Showing kids just how BIG you are inside, and how your gears that operate you are big things. Not some boring set of plastic characters. Plastic referring to the term from Mean Girls (it's a Lindsay Lohan movie, see it if you don't know the term ""plastic""). The emotions all look like plastics, especially Joy. There's a way to 3D model a character in a movie to have a proper kid movie physique. Joy looks like a plastic anorexic. What with all the slang and annoying sarcasm bratty attitudes too. You want your kids seeing that? Back then in a Bug's Life, our kids got to see Princess Atta having a normal girl's figure, Dot her little sister actually had kiddy cheeks, this main girl character in Inside Out is a PLASTIC. PLASTIC I TELL YOU.She gets into the biggest plastic arguments with her parents, I never did that nonsense and no one from the 90s did that stuff. Typical mean kid with a cell phone. The day animated movies FROM PIXAR FOR GOD'S SAKE, have the main character being like 12 with a cell phone? Cell phone when you're under 30 would have been bad back in the 90s. Heck I think even at my age you can't have a cell phone without your mother poking fun at you.This ties back to another point, that animated movies now are using humans as the characters. Why? What did animals ever do to you? Clearly these movie makers now are not from that era when we had beautiful characters like Mufasa, Woody, Sully, Hopper, etc. Where are the villains in this movie? Where's the Kevin Spacey acting? Where's Scar? No one cool? Just some miniskirt plastic punching the dinner table and upsetting her parents? I never did that stuff. Humans as main characters in animated movies DO NOT usually make good film material.Not to mention the whole movie was ridden with high school references, typical plastic stuff. It was so boring I luckily was there when it was on at home, I could just leave the room while the other's watched. Never show this to your kids. It makes them think their world is microscopic and its ran by desk clerks. The ""emotion"" characters really aren't funny or likable, they are NOT cute like Dot from a Bug's Life or Boo from Monsters Inc, they SUCK. And the whole ""I'm a teen so I don't talk to my parents"" thing was forbidden before. Now it's the main subject of the movie? Makes you wonder what this movie maker looks like who made the movie. What the heck are they? Hoodlums? I don't know.You makers need to take a pen and jot down full essays about what makes Lion King so good, Scar so menacing. Kovu from the second Lion King so cool, what makes Heimlick funny from a Bug's Life, what makes Zee a hero from Antz, the list goes on. Such a boring offensive movie. There's so many adult themes I've left out. Trying to turn our beautiful wide eyed hyper children into antisocial desk clerk emotion hormone teens that don't talk to their Mommy and Daddy anymore. My kids were never like this.-99999/10!","

And the voice acting is great also, I mean if you don't find the right voices, it's not gonna work, but they did find the right voices of these characters, the actors really bring them to life. This movie makes us think about the different emotions that go inside our heads. And the character traits of the voices, and what goes in the deepest part of our minds. It's an enjoyable film for the whole family.","

"INSIDE OUT","nick-sultana","7 December 2010","Disney & Pixar have made some worthy films that have become well known to audiences of all ages, but the last few releases haven't reached to the quality and standards they had established (in which the last great film they had made is both Up and Toy Story 3). With their latest offering, it is safe and proud to say that Inside Out establishes them back in the game of quality storytelling, animation and heart its concept.Inside Out explores the mind of a young girl, in her mind we are introduced to the emotions of Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Anger and Fear. They have the roles of controlling emotions that they see through Riley's point of view via headquarters, deciding how she reacts to them (for instance; if Riley was to be happy, Joy would have the controls to do so) and as well they collect 'core memories' that store into the long term memory of Riley in which we are throughout the film shown with moments of happiness, love and set her personality. However, when Riley's family makes a big move to the city it changes the roles of the emotions in Riley in which set off an adventure when Joy and Sadness (an emotion that is often pushed aside) are out What makes this film so well perfect is the mixture of imagination, heart and literally emotion; a concept like this may seem at first impossible to create for the screen but Pixar have come from out and beyond to create an original piece of work that is both open, inspiring and really makes us look in a new way of how our emotions and personal life experiences happen. The animation and use of the right colours for the characters is great and when I mean colour, the emotions themselves have specific colours that represent them as how we understand them. For instance; Joy is yellow, Sadness is blue, Disgust is greens, Fear is purple and Anger of course is red. Each of them has individual personalities that help to establish their roles; Joy is happy, bright and positive that makes Riley seem loved by those around her The emotion that the film carries throughout is further than what Up had already shown us (the well-known and acclaimed 'Married Life' sequence is beyond to what animated films can do to the heart strings), the film makes us personally understand not only the characters on screen but to personally relate to our own life events and personal experiences. The filmmakers have carefully observed on how emotions drive us, in particular Sadness plays a major role in the story that makes us wonder why we can't be sad throughout life but why it's important to be sad when the time comes. In particular, a key moment towards the end of the film pretty much got me and the whole audience (families, couples and even elderly people) in tears and yet understand in our own personal lives the times we get sad. This is a major point that I deeply thought was brought up perfectly and though the much younger kids may not have got it's point but I think from time to time as they grow up they will get the heart of it.Emotion aside, there are lighter moments when humour is present and gets the audience to laugh out loud. The character Bing Bong (an imaginative figure of Riley's earlier years) gives this best when he pops up in the plot, but as well Anger, Fear and the emotions in other human characters provide such humour and even discovering moments in our minds. The humour works very well in the film and it helps to keep the audience on a brighter side.Inside Out is not only a triumphant return to quality storytelling for the filmmakers, but it's both original and engaging for audiences to relate to. Bringing a new way to understand human life and our mind capabilities, the film is perfect for children, adults or even anyone young at heart. This is the best animated film for 2015 and it has a very strong chance in becoming Best Picture in the 2016 Oscars.The animated short 'Lava' that screens before the feature is amazing and different to the comedic shorts from previous years, having more heart and soul and a positive message about love and happiness told through song and colourful animation in detail.","

"INSIDE OUT","lbishopkyo","13 December 2010","You ever watch a movie trailer and you can just tell you're going to hate it? That was this film. When it came out, I knew that I should stay away. Then a few months ago, as part of a project, my teacher had the class and I watch this film because we were learning about perspective-taking or something like that. Within the first five minutes, I knew that it wasn't going to get any better. The first 10 minutes are 85% crying and just people being annoying. That brings me to the first major flaw with this movie: the characters. I hate Riley SO MUCH! She gets sad all the time, but for no good reason...ever. In fact, the first 10-15 minutes of this film are just her crying and being a baby over little things. I wanted to kill myself the longer this went on. I get that we all get sad sometimes, but she gets more upset than any other human being I know, and it happens so spontaneously you have no reason to feel for her. Frankly, I don't know which character I hate more; it's either her or Sadness, who, let me tell you, every second she was onscreen, I wanted to punch her in the face. She spends the entire movie whining and being all angst-ridden and complaining. I get that that's her persona, but it's not done right. Jimmy Neutron did a sad character way better, and they made it funny! This movie's Sadness isn't funny in the slightest. And when everything is said and done, you realize that everything that happens in this movie is basically her fault because tinkers with what she shouldn't. To make matters worse, she never listens to Joy when she tells her DON'T TOUCH THOSE HAPPY MEMORIES. How stupid is this emotion? If I had to make a ""worst characters of all time"" list, she'd be on there with Riley.Oh, and the jokes. Not once did I laugh during this atrocity. I never laughed or even chuckled. The jokes were altogether predictable, boring, and kindergarten-level. Why is it that the non-funny movies are considered to the be the funniest, and the movies that actually ARE funny are the ones left in the dust? This movie's jokes were so bad, they are on par with The Emoji Movie's jokes. Yes. I said that. I actually compared Inside Out to the Emoji Movie. I'd much rather watch that than this. Never has a movie made me want to kill myself, and thankfully I haven't yet, because, it is just a movie. But I still really hate it. This is part of my Top 3 worst movies I've ever seen in my life; it's worse than Ghost Rider 2, worse than Sharknado 3, worst than Toy Story 3, worse than the Clash of the Titans remake and worse than Kubo and the Two Strings.So if you have a very small patience-span, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. It's way too obnoxious and unfunny.","

Yet they also say that the movie was well made and had an excellent concept. My question to these people is this- If you wanted to see a happy meaningless movie with adult toilet humour, why didn't you take your kids to see Minions? Inside out is for those who like quality cinema, to be entertained as well as taught challenging concepts. It is an artistic film. Why do you people always have to assume that all animated films have to be for kids and filled with stupid toilet humour? This is Pixar we are talking about, those who have created Wall-E and Up. Review this movie on its own merits, rather than be biased in your judgement that the film was too dark and confusing for kids. It was never marketed as a film for toddlers and little kids. I went with my brother who is in high school and it was one of the best experiences we had in the cinema in a very long time. Kudos to Pixar; it was truly an amazing, advanced conceptual, artistic film.","

Aren't we all a little too self-absorbed and a little too much of a production as it is? I don't get the premise, but whatever, if it is funny it is funny... but it isn't funny or cute or quality. Amy Poehler is a bully dressed in pleasantries (as is becoming her typecast), the rest of the cast was much better but the writing was stiff and felt like a bad skit from SNL, the laughs are forced and you really don't care about much other than when it will be done. It tries to be smart and deep but sounds like that person you know who loves to recite facts and news without much else, and you find yourself with the blank half-smile stare you reserve for when JWs are at your door and you forgot to pretend you aren't home.Don't get me wrong, I love animated film done right, I was impressed by ""Wreck It Ralph"" and ""Up"" where the voice acting along with the story and writing fit perfectly, this is nothing near those films. If you find ""Tom and Jerry"" type antics as the pinnacle of animated film, this is the film for you, if you are looking for something both with a strong story and characters and voices to match, skip it and don't believe the high rating.","

With Pixar's recent track record of pre/sequel/princess movies (with ""Toy Story 3"" being the only one worth mentioning), they weren't exactly batting a thousand. Which is what made this movie such a pleasant surprise.It's a return to fine form for the studio; great characters, imaginative world, a story that actually connects on more than one level, and most importantly the sense that those tears it's jerking from your eyes aren't for superficial reasons. This is an emotional movie, there can be no doubt. But there's also an amazingly cathartic payoff when all is said and done. And you walk away from this already missing these characters.Hell of a movie.8/10","

When we meet the father's emotions, they're lazily watching sports instead of taking an active interest in family dinner time, while the mother's emotions try to resign themselves to the fact that they have settled for a schlub instead of a handsome ex lover. The daughter is presented as the perfect all-American girl and we are never given even a glimpse of her being anything but perfect until the emotions Joy and Sadness find themselves ejected from the control center of her mind. Then suddenly she's the clichéd brat that lazy story telling will have us believe of every tween and teenager. The most unbelievable action of this character comes when this seemingly ideal daughter decides that in order to be happy she should run away from her loving home and travel alone across the country. All the while, mom and dad take this in their stride as though she's always behaved this way. All this, we are shown, is because the only emotions running the show are anger, disgust and fear, since joy and sadness are still trying to return to the control center. By Pixar's logic, we are incapable of rational actions without joy and sadness. Okay, I get that it's a movie, but this is bad writing. At one point we are expected to accept Sadness's antics simply because she claims that she doesn't know why she's doing what she's doing. What!?! If the ones controlling the brain cannot account for their actions, then what is the point of the premise? Perhaps the sequel will show us the emotions inside the heads of the emotions sadness, joy and the rest. Aside from the terrible story line and lack of character depth, the film lacks the usual humor we have come to associate with Pixar, and while Joy and Sadness's quest to get back where they belong is undoubtedly frustrating for them, the constant obstacles they encounter make it almost unbearable to sit through. Mostly, I feel, because again and again they keep getting sooooo close, only to have something happen and they have to find another way, finally making it happen through the use of a stack of imaginary boyfriends. Let me say that again: They finally get back to control by stacking up a bunch of imaginary boyfriends. Yes, I know, it's a movie, and a cartoon at that, but this is Pixar. We have come to expect better. Well, I have, at least. Judging by the other reviews and the box office, Inside Out is a huge hit. I still cannot fathom why. I must be taking crazy pills.","

"INSIDE OUT","MissSimonetta","28 December 2010","One thing which fascinates me with the general Pixar output is the streak of melancholy in so many of their films: Woody and Buzz's awareness of the ephemeral nature of life, Mr. Incredible's mid-life crisis, Wall-E's post-apocalyptic world, and the loneliness of Carl Frederickson quickly spring to mind. Inside Out (2015) continues this tradition with its examination of the inherent melancholy in life.The commercials and trailers show off the bright colors and sparkling comedy, but there is so much more beneath the candy colored surface. This is a story about the pain and alienation that comes with growing up. In a society where we want to push past unpleasant aspects of life without reflecting, where we want to rush as fast as possible, this film gives us an important lesson: sadness is necessary, grief is essential, and whenever we confront pain in our lives, we must not try to brave the path by ourselves. It's extraordinary and moving, proof that Pixar is back on track giving us modern classics and not tripe.","

"INSIDE OUT","JudithClark","12 October 2011","This is an easy one for me as I agree with the other reviewers. I was surprised as all I had heard and read about Inside Out led me to believe it was wonderful, so it's not me it's Pixar. Fortunately, I did not have to pay extra as it was on the STARZ channel, which is part of my TV package.It is beautifully ""drawn"", the speech and lip movements are wonderful. But I found it confusing and depressing. All those different colored balls rolling about, and the blue Depression was definitely annoying. I feel sorry for parents who had anticipated being able to take their children to see ""Inside Out"". There aren't a lot of movies that are family oriented.Pixar has made so many wonderful movies in the past and I know they can and have done better. I look forward to their next production.","

"INSIDE OUT","tommyhawka","5 March 2011","Inside out shows the struggles of a child moving house. It tells to never loose hope. Now you may think this is a very simple story and good but it's more complicated than you think. Most of the movie is about these two characters joy and sadness trying to get back into the kids brain. Literally. This movie is way too complicated for what it is and it could have been really simple. Actually, I think they could have made the movie better without the cartoon characters: joy, sadness, angry, and whatever the rest are. Oh and also this movie is no fun at all. There are no laughs until the credits and I don't think kids would really like this at all. They were laughing tonnes when the minions trailer came on before the movie and when I came out of the movie all I saw was kids crying. I would really think twice before seeing this one. Congratulations Disney you have ruined another movie that could have been great. What happened to the times when you made Finding Nemo, The incredibles.","

"INSIDE OUT","TouchTheGarlicProduction","24 April 2014","News flash for all these people complaining -- Pixar makes sad movies! This should not be news to anyone who has seen a Pixar movie before. And anyone who thinks that that's a bad thing in this case are the ones who the moral of this movie is aimed at. The other complaint that people are having is that they heard it's an original story, when in fact the 'voices in your head' idea has been done before. Yeah, the basic concept has been shown, but so has every concept. And it's not the concept that people are talking about being original; it's the moral. It was absolutely brilliant how they went about explaining a complex moral in a way that children can understand yet doesn't feel overly preachy either. It is a difficult balance to strike, and no matter how well you do it, someone will always dislike it. It shouldn't make me as angry as it does that so many people are misunderstanding this movie. There'll always be somebody, but this is as close to a perfect movie as you'll ever see, and I really wish that there weren't so many stupid people ruining it.","

"INSIDE OUT","wembleyfm","10 December 2010","I'd read that this movie is a contender for not only Best Animated movie, but even Best Picture at the Oscars. This is a very different film to one I've seen from Disney/Pixar tackling a very adult theme in human emotions. It's clever in the way it portrays the emotions and takes us into the world of the subject's mind. What loses it for me is that the film seems lost between playing out as a psychiatric experiment and being a film to entertain little children. The moral of the story seems lost amongst the confusing adventure within the subject's brain. The concept is certainly original and no doubt will be used as a talking forum in biology or human development lessons for years to come...it belongs in educational circles.","

"INSIDE OUT","Hitchcoc","15 October 2020","As is often the case, before I could see this film, I had a host of people tell me how it affected them. Tears, creativity, uniquely presented emotions. This always shades the stuff I feel personally. While it didn't speak to me as much as others, I have to admit that it was enjoyable and highly creative. We have as our protagonist, Riley, a little girl who has been fawned on her whole life. She is happy like all kids with a few bumps along the way, as well as typical behavior. We find out that she has been formed by a set of emotions who take on an anthropomorphic being. The five of them create her personality. Unfortunately for her, the family moves from its idyllic setting in Minnesota to San Francisco, where everything is indeed different. During this time, the five emotions become unsettled and this becomes a kind of adventure tale. Joy and Sadness get shot out of their control center, and while they are finding their ways back, Riley begins to fall apart. The strength of this animated film has to do with all aspects of consciousness, such the area of creativity and art where the characters are turned into Picasso figures and later two dimensional figures. There is also the ""Train"" of consciousness, as well as some Freudian stuff to work with. Memories are save on little orbs and are at the center of putting a person back together again. An imaginary friend is brought in as well. This is quite adult at times, showing things that the kids just won't get. Well worth the time to see it. Oh, I know it's been said before. Stop giving movies ones unless they are deserving. Your job is to review, not to vilify things that aren't perfect. A one should be used to evaluate a cheap 1950's horror movie or an exploitation film, not a thoughtful animated feature that has charmed the vast majority of viewers.","

"INSIDE OUT","KnightsofNi11","23 May 2013","In the past few years, I'm not gonna lie, Pixar Studios have had some duds. They became far too comfortable on the sequel train that didn't require boundary pushing creative storytelling to make millions. Monsters University was a sore disappointment and don't even get me started on Cars 2. Now, they've finally decided to get off that train and return to their roots in telling incredibly clever and beautifully original stories, and they're quickly being reminded that this train makes lots of money, too. Inside Out takes us back to the Pixar heyday of films like Toy Story, A Bug's Life, and The Incredibles and reminds us why we fell in love with this studio, and why adults and children alike can enjoy the hell out of an animated movie made ""for kids."" Pixar has always been playing with the idea of giving emotions to different creatures (toys, bugs, fish, etc.) and now they've gone Inception on us and given feelings to FEELINGS. Inside Out is the ultimate personification of what goes on in a person's head as they think and feel different things, having their decisions and actions fueled by the multitude of emotions swirling about in their brain. And by multitude I mean five because that's a workable amount of characters and voice actors to fill the core of your story.Inside Out follows Riley, a girl from Minnesota who moves to San Francisco with her family. Inside her head lives Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear, and Anger. These five personified emotions work together to keep Riley's mind in check in an elaborate and infinitely clever world full of personality islands, thought trains, imaginary friends lost in long term memory, and so many other brilliant representations of abstract concepts that exist in the human brain. Pixar has always had a knack for high concept world building, and they've outdone themselves here. If you want a totally immersive experience within a world that is abstractly absurd yet also feels so real, then go see this movie. Inside Out builds a world and a system that is full of all the fantastical elements you would expect from an animated experience like this, but it is executed so well and the way thoughts and feelings are represented hits so close to home that after the movie you'll find yourself imagining what your little feeling characters are like in your own head. You'll find yourself thinking about what your own core memories are and what islands of personality they power. Inside Out represents growing up in a way we've never seen done before. It is a perfect way of making sense of all the different emotions we experience as we grow up and learn more about the world. I promise that you've never seen a coming of age story like this. I honestly don't know if I've ever experienced an animated film of this caliber that, while so fantastical and so extravagant, also feels so real. The human brain is nothing more than billions and trillions of electrical synapses, but sometimes those synapses can create something beautiful, like this incredible personification of the mind that is adorable, funny, sentimental, and powerfully touching. I'm so thankful for the synapses working in the minds of those geniuses over at Pixar, because it has given us one of the most heartwarming films in a long, long time that is so universally relate-able I don't know how anybody couldn't enjoy it. I suppose if your Joy emotion were trapped somewhere in the halls of Long Term Memory that might be one way you wouldn't enjoy Inside Out, but hopefully she can catch the next Thought Train back to emotion headquarters soon. Yes, I believe I will be explaining mine and all other emotions through personified characters voiced by Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, and Lewis Black for a while now. This movie had an impact on me, for sure, in the best way possible.","

Then there are the complicated explanations of long term/short term memory, REM sleep cycles, I mean, If I were a 5 year old, I wouldn't know what was going on after about 10 mins, I'd be lost.Not to mention that there are long stretches of fast action accompanied by loud rather jarring music and shrill voices etc.It's a mess of a movie & definitely not for the very young because they won't understand it, believe me.","

The first 1 hour of the movie i was waiting for  the main problem that would be the objective of the story but i was  actually watching it this whole time and watching it through the end i  just felt nothing and said ""is that it? what the heck?"".   The climax/ending was very weak it was somehow really flat probably  because the main obstacle itself was rather stupid.  The movie environment seemed very dull and narrow especially for the  imaginary part of the mind. The special 5 mind characters are annoying  and predictable. The jokes and dialogs are not memorable.  I don't know what kind of drugs these good reviewers are using but this  is the worst Disney PIXAR movie yet, it's so bad that i decided to  write my first review for this abomination of an animation.  I would give this 5/10, but with the misleading score such as 8.4, i  feel there is an obligation to demote it down hence the 1/10.

"INSIDE OUT","ferguson-6","18 January 2012","Greetings again from the darkness. Once upon a time  in 1995 to be exact  Pixar revitalized and revolutionized the world of animated movies with the release of the first Toy Story. In the process, they sent our expectations soaring for each of their subsequent movies. Despite the pressure of such high standards, the creative geniuses at the studio have regularly thrilled and delighted us over the years with classics such as Cars (2006), Ratatouille (2007), Wall-E (2008), and Brave (2012). And beyond these, there have been a few true cinematic masterpieces – transcendent films: Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), Up (2009), and Toy Story 3 (2010). This most recent release unquestionably belongs in the latter group  it's one for the ages (and all ages).Genius and brilliance could be used to describe all aspects of this movie. It's a technical marvel, a visual kaleidoscope of bright colors across the full screen, and most amazingly, it packs an emotional wallop with real life moments for adolescents and parents alike.My comments will be brief because this is one you should experience for yourself – and probably more than once. Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) is an 11 year old girl who lives in Minnesota and loves her parents, her friends, and hockey. She is happy and well-adjusted. When the family relocates to San Francisco, broccoli on the pizza is only one of the challenges Riley must face. This change affects everything for her – no more friends, no more hockey, and a strained relationship with her parents. At this point, you are probably saying ""So what? That's nothing we haven't seen before."" And you are correct, except we have never seen it explained the way Pixar does.We literally go behind-the-scenes of Riley's brain and see the control panel of her emotions. There is a constant battle between Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kaling), Anger (Lewis Black), and the ring-leader Joy (Amy Poehler). This is an exploration of emotions and memories, and the explanation has some scientific merit. Memories are depicted as marbles, and Riley's favorite things are shown as islands (Sports Island, Friendship Island, etc). How emotions affect memories is the key point here, and especially how sadness is necessary and vital to our joy. Have you wondered why we forget our imaginary childhood friends (Riley's is Bing Bong, voiced by Richard Kind)? Have you wondered why our memories change over time, and are impacted by our emotional state in any given moment? This animated gem will help you understand.Director Pete Docter (the genius behind Up) has a daughter of his own, and he clearly ""gets"" the emotional changes brought on during the pre-teen years. His research, and that of co-director Ronaldo Del Carmen, takes us on an adventure that should inspire much conversation between parents and kids. And even if it somehow doesn't break the ice in every family, it will at a minimum help youngsters and parents better understand the link between emotions and memories  plus, they will probably share a good cry and a bunch of laughs along the way. Hats off (again) to the Pixar geniuses. I dare you to top this one!***NOTE: you should also look forward to another Pixar tradition – the pre-movie short film. This one is a very unique short entitled Lava.","

"INSIDE OUT","Movie_Muse_Reviews","16 August 2020","When Pixar announced ""Up"" and ""Monsters Inc."" director Pete Docter's ""Untitled Pixar Film that Takes You Inside the Mind,"" there was little doubt that the animation giant and its brilliant minds had yet another work of genius in development. Flash forward and the revolutionary studio has not disappointed with this endlessly creative, whimsical journey now titled ""Inside Out.""This totally original film couldn't have come too soon for Pixar fans following the commercial cash-grabs that were ""Cars 2"" and ""Monsters University"" and the beautiful yet very traditional fairy tale ""Brave"" (not to mention no film in 2014). It's a huge bounce back, and it would not be a stretch to call this Pixar's most creative film, or even the most creative animated film of the digital era. The story depicts 11-year-old Riley's first major life challenge: moving from Minnesota to San Francisco with her mother and father. Yet it imagines her entire personality/brain as its own living world, piloted by her five chief emotions, all personified as characters: Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Fear (Bill Hader) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling).Narrated by Joy, we see key moments of Riley's life growing up that have become her ""core memories,"" represented as shiny orbs, with each memory triggering a part of Riley's personality. To this point, Riley's core memories are all tinted yellow because they have been joyful, and Joy plans to keep it that way. The big move, however, makes this challenging, and after a struggle with Sadness, Joy and Sadness find themselves booted out of Riley's command center and into her long- term memory. With only Anger, Fear and Disgust to guide her, Riley becomes unpredictable, and Joy and Sadness must find their way back before the damage becomes irreversible. Along the way, they team up with Riley's imaginary friend, Bing Bong, who assists (and innocently misguides) their journey through all parts of Riley's mind including her abstract thought and subconscious. The praise for ""Inside Out"" could stop at the fact that it's a compelling animated film without a main villain. When was the last time you saw one of those? Case in point. The story creates danger and suspense by throwing new obstacles at Joy and Sadness left and right, creating a sense of doubt wondering what might happen to Riley if they can't make it back to ""head""quarters. Docter and co- writer/director Ronaldo Del Carmen use sheer creative force to fuel intrigue in the other moments.""Inside Out"" is awe-inspiring in the way it fully develops this personified version of the mind and carries it through to fruition with such conviction that none of the loose ends in the concept derail it. This is exceptionally elaborate, demolishing even ""Wreck- It Ralph"" in terms of world-building. From how the mind processes and removes memories to what is going on when you dream, the film is an ever-growing tower of ""what if we did this?!"" ideas piled one on top of the other and it never topples over.Pixar's trademark tear-jerking, heartstring-tugging M.O. is in place here as well, even if not to the same extent as ""Toy Story 3"" or the flashback sequence in ""Up."" The importance of love and support, the challenges of childhood – the connections the film makes to the human experience are so profound and direct despite such an abstract premise and unusual storyline.Topped with spot-on voice casting and a visual style that distinguishes itself while remaining true to Pixar's form, ""Inside Out"" is an instantly lovable film for kids and adults, one that current children will grow to love different at each stage in their lives. Speaking of, the bar is quite high for a puberty-driven sequel.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more","

"INSIDE OUT","diac228","13 April 2014","20 years in the film business, Pixar has given us masterpiece after masterpiece even if its best days are probably behind them. They know how to toy with your emotions, add depth to their characters, and best of all know how to deliver very unique stories in very unique perspectives. Director Pete Doctor's previous movie Up is a grandiose example of being an excellent film despite being far off the norm. Inside Out is no exception as it tackles a very complicated yet creative concept of exploring the emotions of a person while giving personalities to emotions---which is no easy task.Inside Out being made into a feasible family movie is quite the accomplishment. Even if the deeper emotional moments and better jokes will be lost on the children, this film has something for everybody to see, from the visuals to the creative stylings of the human mind. Combine that with the perfect (Its honestly flawless) voice cast and a well-rounded script, you have Pixar's best since Toy Story 3.Joy (The perfect Amy Poehler) leads the cast as she attempts to dominate the mind of an 11-year-old and keep the other emotions (Anger, Disgust, Fear, and especially Sadness) in check---especially once the family relocates across the entire country. The conflict arises once Joy becomes unable to run Riley's emotions, leading to a lot of problems inside the mind and outside. Although Pixar runs in the Disney family and you secretly know how it will all pan out, the adventure and discoveries leading up to the inevitable conclusion is what keeps you engaged. There will be the classic Pixar mix of laughter, tears, and surprises throughout the quest to save Riley.Establishing the universe is essential in movies like these, where environments carry its distinctive logic, its distinctive gravity. Inside Out starts out slow so it can mesh out the characters and give us a good idea as to how to approach the world of the mind. By the time you reach the dramatic conclusion, you would have witnessed Riley's imaginative world, her abstract world, her dream machine, as well as her biggest fears. The journey is far from predictable, as Inside Out explores a concept rarely executed (save for a 90s cartoon and a hilarious Spongebob bit).Pixar has had a rough run lately, with delays and disappointing movies mixing together this decade. Inside Out is a step in the right direction thanks to a great script, delightful originality, and the great mix of great animation, laughs and heartfelt moments that we last experienced in the epic Pixar run of 2007-2010 (Ratatouille, Up, Wall-E, Toy Story 3, etc.). It might be slower or more bizarre then what you are used to seeing in animation and blockbuster season, but this film is a fresh visual treat from start to finish.","

"INSIDE OUT","OliverGinger","23 March 2012","Before I start, I will say this; I'm writing this after coming back from a second viewing of Inside Out. Both viewings were out of choice. That's not a unique thing, but I very rarely watch films more than once at the cinema, mainly because life is short, or rather, life is too quick for me. But there's two main reasons why people watch some films more than once at the cinema, especially where I come from; either the film was interesting, detailed, or multi-layered and needs to be seen again to sink in properly, or, it was really, really good.In this case, for me, it's the latter. That's not to say that the film isn't interesting, detailed or multi-layered, but the reason that was repeating in my head to see it again was 'it's really, really good.' But is it? Yes, yes of course it is... Speaking with a bunch of friends with whom I saw it the first time, a risky phrase was unanimously agreed upon, which was that we 'trust the Pixar team to do the right thing.' Needless (totally needless) to say that expectations were high, and frankly, they were surpassed.Even though the film is what we come to expect from Pixar (the universal moral themes, the perfect balance between comedy and sadness, and visually stunning animation and action sequences), I didn't feel that I had seen it all before, and neither was it repetitive nor 'ordinary'. The film hits all the high notes, with perfect intonation, and with discipline and passion. As touched on before, the balance between humour and sadness is strong and impressive; the amount of emotions that the film displays and takes us through is varied and immersive, yet not overwhelming. The film executes such clever ideas with simplicity and ease, leaving us to feel for the characters rather than worry about the 'science' of it all, or even being worried about 'not getting it'.The animation is constantly eye-drawing and detailed; the characters' glistening skin is particularly wondrous. And what great characters they are. Riley is brilliantly sympathetic throughout, even with her difficult mood swings, and the supporting characters are perfectly entertaining. One might think that the superficial nature of the characters (Anger is angry, Fear is always scared etc.) would become old quickly, however the fun never diminishes, thanks to a witty script, expressive animation, and very strong voice performances from the entire cast.However, to top all this off, the real gem comes from the character of Joy, surely a strong contender in the list of Pixar's greatest characters. Even though we are inside the head of Riley for the majority of the film, and the events that drive the movie are essentially her reactions to her new world (moving from Minnesota to San Francisco), the story is Joy's. Being probably the most flawed character in the film (paradoxically, maybe), it's her journey we care about the most, and she ends up being the most in-depth character in the film, occasionally questioning her actions in the first half (well, the cynics will be), and becoming the most sympathetic by the end. Amy Poehler's outstanding performance makes Joy simultaneously the strongest and weakest character in the film (emotionally, that is).After all of this, the freshness of the ideas, the simplified neuroscience, the technical brilliance (saying that, Giacchino's score is probably the most subtle thing in the film, exquisitely putting the finishing touches on the most emotional scenes), fleshed out characters and universal themes, all of this comes together simply to entertain us, to let us escape, and to release us emotionally, which it does by making us laugh and cry in an even and fair manner.And you will laugh. And you will cry. And it is fun to do so. Thank god we're living in a time when Pixar is making these films.","

"INSIDE OUT","watchingwatchwatcher","5 February 2016","I've been seeing some of the reviews here, half of you people saying it's ""depressing"" and half hating it because it's getting popular, and I have to say... I'm really annoyed by all this. Of course there's going to be some sadness in it, cause it's mainly about a kid's emotions. Emotions trying to help a kid to adjust her new life. Have you all forgotten how you felt when you had to move away? From the place you've grown up at and made such good friends? Going to a new school? Possibly be a outcast? I personally think this film is good for both kids AND adults. There is silliness for the kids, but also showing stuff that parents could learn from this film. I think today's society is being too hard on films like this lovely one because it's basically showing real life problems from a realistic family/child.","

It is such a universal experience that it makes sense to dramatize. This starts out coming across as if it's going to be very simplistic, and over the course of it, it reveals more depth. As much as we would all love to be happy all the time, sometimes that isn't realistic, and we have to allow ourselves that.The animation is amazing; tremendously expressive faces and body language, strong use of color, lighting and shadow. There is a certain level of logic to the world of Riley's mind. While the various characters are of course in part meant to appeal to kids, they are also interesting and engaging. The abstraction scene is tremendously creative, same for Imaginationland, and the dinner scene, though somewhat stereotypical, is very clever.I recommend this to everyone. 8/10.","

"INSIDE OUT","Paynebyname","5 February 2011","I like Pixar films and sat down to this not knowing a huge amount about it.I had an inkling of the basics having seen one of the very early trailers but I hadn't fully immersed myself in all the footage. This meant that I went in reasonably fresh and waiting to be entertained.Granted the concept was fresh, granted there was plenty of invention but it was like they threw them in a tombola and spilled them out into the film without any judicious selectivity.I remember watching the making of featurette for Big Hero 6 and they were discussing how Pixar don't really storyboard a film preferring it to have an organic growth. Now sometimes that can work but for Inside Out it certainly didn't.It just felt like it was made by a large group of people throwing great ideas into the pot but no one then sifting through them to see how they worked in the film. It lacked a firm director to weed out and discard some of these ideas and concentrate on the forward drive of the film.It needed someone to temper the proceedings so Joy didn't dominate the film so much. It needed someone to keep the film bouncing along without slowing down for the next great idea.I was genuinely surprised to find myself bored halfway through and having to give contemplation to leaving when my GF suggested it. As it was I carried on but my attention wasn't held and my wonder wasn't awed.So yes, plenty of clever ideas but not enough focus or momentum.","

"INSIDE OUT","joeravioli","8 December 2010","Flaws notwithstanding, Inside Out is a capitalist's perverse dream come true -- however his dream manifests outside of his subconscious is commendable within itself. It's a highly-anticipated film put out by the biggest animation studio in the world, packed with enough goofy jokes to satisfy children and enough reliably maudlin manipulation in the form of homogenized adolescence to please adults. The concept explodes with novelty and the animation is brilliant. And best of all, its main characters all come in fuzzy, furry, huggable forms that will no doubt sell mountains upon mountains of stuffed animals and other such material detritus until the faces of Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear are plastered by fingerpaint-stained hands onto the pages of the haplessly constructed book of icons and dank memes (""o sh_t waddup"").Inside Out is blatantly artificial. The film is mired in concept and marketability, sacrificing a solid narrative - which Pixar usually promises - as a result.","

"INSIDE OUT","Christopher_Reid","13 January 2014","Inside Out takes us inside the mind of a young girl as she grows up and goes through various changes and emotions. It's humorous, moving and thought-provoking. The concept is simple and a bit arbitrary - that our minds consist of 5 primary emotions that take turns directing our actions. But this idea is really just a starting point for countless observations about the many subtleties of human emotion.The movie is ripe for deeper interpretations. I feel like anyone learning psychology could draw upon so many helpful analogies via this film. The way we store old memories, forget things, remember random things, alternate quickly between different emotions, change as we grow up, develop moral values, etc. Inside Out visualises these things in ways which are often funny but also abstractly seem to make perfect sense.There are many parallels to another masterpiece, Inception. Both films delve into the inner workings of the human mind. The ideas they present are deeply original and profound. They have universal relevance because the scene of the action is perhaps the only thing absolutely everyone has in common (a mind of course). In fact, it's a concept we often seem to forget or skim over. That great mystery of who we are, what we are, what exactly are thoughts and feelings and what defines who we truly are? Do we love ourselves? Do we even know ourselves? Modern society seems to focus exclusively on the external world, forgetting that we ""exist"" and carry a world within our own minds. In both movies, our hero confronts something within themselves and grows as a result.Monster's, Inc. was full of jokes specific to the world it had created and so is Inside Out. The writers clearly had fun adding all the little details. I'm confident that Inside Out will only grow in comedic value with each viewing. The characters are true to themselves and the movie never stops for the sake of a gag. The comedy naturally flows out of what's happening.I was deeply moved by this movie. Its story is far more tragic and deeply sad than the colours and humour make it seem. It's about a child's world gradually falling apart. And yet somewhere in her subconscious, she desperately tries to find happiness again. It strips humanity down to its most basic level. Our truest, most personal feelings that we are sometimes afraid to acknowledge or accept. Everyone has felt what she feels. And any adult will understand the frightening possibilities that are alluded to and how differently things could have turned out.I feel I've learned new things about life and human emotions. Sometimes the distinction between happiness and sadness can become blurred. We can't always have control of our emotions (but perhaps we can choose how to handle them). The way we feel about the past can change unexpectedly. Healing can sometimes be scary and painful but worth it. It may be better to accept how we feel than to act tough and become something we're not. We're usually more loved than we realise. Our experiences can shape who we are. Often when we grow, we lose things but gain richer things. We can create a moment of joy out of an unpleasant situation. People often walk away from things with completely different ideas of what just happened. These might not all be amazing revelations, but they are presented here so poetically that your perspective is refreshed.The film-making is of such a high calibre that the entire focus is on the story and the experience. I don't want to write about the voice-acting or animation or effects or script or music because I didn't notice any of it. But I guess that really just means they were all excellent. I never had a chance to complain because I was completely engaged. We see what we're meant to see and feel what we're meant to feel. Pixar appears to be full of talented and passionate film-makers and it shows with all of their movies. Inside Out pulls at our heartstrings and opens our eyes like it's no big deal. This is a true work of art worthy of admiration and wholehearted enjoyment.","

"INSIDE OUT","tabuno","12 August 2019","23 June 2015. This innovating, educational, appealing, and emotion-laden animated movie dazzles with a spectrum of delightful and meaningful portrayals throughout its 94 minute running time. Not since Wall*e (2008), Robin William's What Dreams May Come (1998), La Planete sauvage (1973), The Incredibles (2004), or Spirited Away (2001) has there been an animated movie that brings out a fresh, vibrant experience involving deep universal emotions between family members. The movies incorporates of a creative, simplified but reliable look at the brain and emotions and how each one of them, especially those that might surprise many audience members are essential for human authenticity and mental health.What's even more impressive is Inside Out avoids reliance on super special effects to compel the audience to awe and wonder, but rather a playful assortment of imaginative visions that oftentimes Japanese animated movies have been famous for and uses a substantive, meaningful, spirited script to keep the audience entranced with its universal themes of the ties that bind joy and sadness. This is well balanced movie that elicits laughter, sadness, anger, and happiness and all the emotions reflected in the movie without crass marketing manipulation.","

"INSIDE OUT","bowmanblue","20 August 2020","Normally, when I take my ten-year-old daughter to the cinema to see a 'children's' movie, I normally just sit there praying for it to end as it's just a load of colourful sentimental nonsense designed to fill an hour and a half's time. My daughter, and most of those who are around her age, all sit there laughing and enjoying the film. I just want to go home. This is because – naturally – children's movies are aimed at children (no surprise there then!) and, as an adult I have to accept that and just go along with it. That was until I saw 'Inside Out.' Here the film seems to be written the other way round. Yes, I loved it. I had a great time during the screening. And, although there were plenty of colourful characters for my daughter to watch, I didn't really think that she (or 90% of the under elevens in the audience) really appreciated it.We're shown that, right from birth, we have little characters in our heads controlling different areas of our personality – a happy little character for 'joy,' a depressed little character for 'sadness' and so on. These quirky little creatures control and dictate our actions and therefore life throughout our lives. The little characters we meet here reside inside a little girl called Riley's head. And, when she moves house and her life gets turned upside down, the little people inside her mind go on an adventure throughout her body – in particular various aspects of her mind.And this is where things get a little complicated. Well... not for me, but then I'm an adult. However, some – in fact quite a lot – of the gags start to fall flat on the children's ears when the characters on screen walk into the 'subconscious' and you're treated to the 'horrors' which reside buried deep in all our minds. And this is how it went on. More and more of the story seemed to be designed for those with a least a better understanding of the way our minds work that your average 'Pixar-watching' child.I've read other reviews and I see that a lot of kids did actually enjoy this film. However, I just wonder on what level they did? My daughter loved it, but the characters were pretty and 'good' was easily distinguishable from 'bad.' Personally, I loved Inside Out and would happily watch it again. I thought it was clever and different. I also couldn't help but think I was watching some sort of Christopher Nolan film like 'Inception.' Adults will love it. Kids should love it. Just be prepared to explain some metaphysical aspects of a Disney film during the drive home from the cinema!","

"INSIDE OUT","ElMaruecan82","28 June 2016","I often dreamed about movies, but never BEFORE watching them. It happened with ""Inside Out"", I had heard so many great things about it and the ubiquitous multi-colored posters were so eye-catchy, that the film was ""inside"" my mind already, fittingly so, and now that I saw it, I can say that it will stay there... for a while.""Inside Out"" is indeed the kind of movie that makes you want to emulate Amélie by turning around in the theater and see the smiling faces of the people around. I don't know for you, but after a few minutes, my eyes were literally glued to the screen, and from the expression on my face, you could tell that Joy's smile and optimism were irresistibly contagious.The entrance of Joy (Amy Poehler) and the genesis of the other emotion-related creatures in the mind of little Riley, echoed both my memories as a child and my current life as a little girl's daddy. Now, I look at her cries, her tantrums and the way she makes funny faces when told to behave herself in a whole different light. In less than five minutes, the film had already hit a sensitive chord, not that I doubt an animated film could achieve such a sentimental 'stunt', ""Mary and Max."" and ""Up"" had also done a terrific job on that level.It's worth mentioning ""Up"" because the two films hold a few similarities, beside being from the same director Pete Docter. Indeed, after tackling the loneliness of old age and the mourning of lost dreams, it's time for a brighter mindset, no pun intended. Riley is a preteen girl, still young enough to make monkey faces with Daddy, think of boys as playmates and sleep with soft toys, but she's old enough to react with maturity and empathy as her parents expect from their happy girl (in parent's language ""understanding"") and all the emotions help Riley to face this critical time of her life, by pushing the right button (inside) at the right moment (out), literally.So, as the title suggests, the film is set in two worlds, the real world with Riley moving with her parents from Minnesota to San Francisco and the inside of her head, the ""headquarters"" where emotions lead the show. The Chief Emotion is Joy, a blue-haired Tinkerbell-like creature with hair shaped like a star and radiating such an illuminated yellow she doesn't have a shadow. Joy looks at the bright side of life, and makes it a point of honor not to let Riley surrender to sadness the poor, short, rotund, bespectacled Sadness (Phyllis Smith) who can't push any button, and that doesn't do any good to her already low self-esteem.With a bossy emotion like Joy, Riley is a naturally happy girl, but as you would read in every 'Stay Positive' or 'Emotional Intelligence' book, each feeling has a reason to exist. Anger allows us to defend our integrity and fear is about self-preservation, sadness is a reaction to things we can't control and disgust, well disgust actually feels like a 'filler' because it doesn't have more reason to be there than, say, surprise or distrust. Never mind, the real outsider is Sadness. In other headquarters, thing go differently: the mother's chief emotion is Sadness and a mustached 'Anger' controls the father (by the way, I enjoyed these little glimpses on other headquarters, a nice touch for a film full of them).Now to the emotions, voiced by Lewis Black and based on his stand-up routines, Anger is a red fire brick dressed like a tired businessman, Fear is a purple raw nerve voiced by Bill Hader and Disgust is a broccoli-shaped fashion victim voiced by Mindy Kaling. Cinema is an Art of imagery and I don't think there's been a film as visually stunning without going for complex forms and settings; it's all in the colors, shapes and personalities. Emotions are people, memories are balls with the same color than their emotional value and Riley's mind is an enchanting Oz-like place, surrounded by Goofball, Family or Friendship Islands, where the core memories are 'stocked'.I was critical toward ""Inception"" because the film had a similar concept but didn't have much to offer except for predictable CGI special effects. In ""Inside Out"", emotions, dreams, imaginary friends, little things that define us, everything is materialized in a creatively allegorical way. This is escapism at its best and it didn't have to go as far as the Lost Falls. Recreating an entire world is the biggest challenge of animated cartoons, but ""Inside Out"" created an entire new world and made its functioning coherent, easy to follow and scientifically viable in a weird way.But I make it sound like a technical achievement, the film also fulfills its premise in the storytelling department. By accidentally preventing Sadness from saddening a happy memory during the first day of school, both Joy and Sadness are expelled from the headquarters and get lost somewhere in the brain. They must get back, otherwise, Riley will only be controlled by anger, disgust and fear. And the oddest thing is that Riley's behavior still looks familiar from an outsider's perspective. Seriously, how many times we've met young kids behaving exactly like Riley?The film unexpectedly provides some interesting insights about kids' behavior and the way they repress positive emotions, to the point that even the 'negative' ones can't control them and make them capable of anything. Some parts are so intense they catch you off-guard, but they help to show the importance of emotions depending on the context. And during this unforgettable journey, Joy will also understand the power of sadness as a vehicle for happier emotions... no high spots without low ones.I start with smiles and I conclude with tears, because after all, this is still a Disney film, and paraphrasing the Master: for every laugh, there should be a tear. Hear, hear, Joy!","

I thought Pixar really out did themselves! This is my favorite Pixar film of all time! I found myself having belly laughs through the whole thing, along with tears at other parts. Disgust and anger and fear were also very well made, and featured very funny moments as they try to function when joy and sadness are missing. This movie really just leaves you more than satisfied.

"INSIDE OUT","natashabowiepinky","10 November 2019","Maybe I just don't get it. Perhaps there's something intrinsic to the the whole experience I require clarifying on. Somewhere, there might be an obscure reason I don't feel as passionately about this film as others have.Or maybe, JUST maybe...Inside Out is overrated.I mean, yea... The animation is excellent. But this is PIXAR we're talking about here... Not Hanna Barbera, circa 1970's. It kinda comes with the territory. And yes, the concept is very clever... But then again, it reminds me of an old comic strip I used to read called 'The Numbskulls' about small men controlling an average human's body. Then of course, there was the film Osmosis Jones, which regarded the adventures of the tiny people who were involved in the day-to-day running of Bill Murray. Not one of his funniest roles, BTW.But something is definitely missing here. I found sections of the film a bit dull, none of the attempts at humour really made me laugh, and that pink elephant 'imaginary friend' was almost as obnoxious as Olaf the snowman. The part where I suppose we were meant to feel sad, as he was abandoned to fade away with the rest of the Riley's memories, just made me think 'about ruddy time'. What else was he supposed to do... Live, and cause a pre-teen to go through years of enforced therapy?There wasn't enough going on in the human world, either...There was no real bond, with Riley, our lead character and the viewer... She felt more like a robot programmed by her five emotions than a living, breathing person. Her parents were as stereotypical and plastic as they come, and no other person has enough interaction with Riley for us to empathise with them... Or her, for that matter.So, what it all boils down to is the quintet of emotions who live in her head and apparently call the shots there. Of them, Anger, Disgust and Fear and the most interesting, but guess what? They're the ones who get the shortest thrift in the script, and end up (for the most part) stuck in the 'control room' while Joy and Sadness go on the main quest. Joy's eternal perkiness is irritating, and Sadness is just a walking doormat. Not the pair I would have chosen for the lion's share of the movie to follow... And the film suffers because of this.A lot of critics praise the authenticity of the memories Riley has and how it reminds them of their own children and lost youth... REALLY?! In that case, there must be a lot of reviewers out there who live in unbearably corny Life Insurance commercials, full of stock images and manufactured familiar situations. Watching the sun go down? First day at school? Eating broccoli?! Do me a favour.Plus, some of them seem a bit unlikely... In one flashback, Riley misses the big shot in a hockey game, and hands the championship to the rival side. What do the rest of her team do? Why, put her on their shoulders and throw her up in the air repeatedly!! In the cutthroat world of American competitive sport, I HIGHLY doubt it. Or perhaps they just like being Losers. Hmm...I did actually enjoy the film, so you might think I'm being a tad harsh. But bear in mind this is PIXAR we're talking about here... Who's every feature was virtually a masterpiece. After a string of underwhelming flicks, though (Brave, Cars 2, Monsters University, and now this) perhaps it's about time I stopped treating them as the purveyors of miracles, and think of the company as a normal studio who pumps out spectacularly animated but somewhat shallow productions. Just like Dreamworks.What a shame. 6/10","

"INSIDE OUT","anaconda-40658","15 January 2011","Inside Out (2015): Dir: Pete Docter, Ronaldo Del Carmen / Voices: Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Mindy Kaling: Another Pixar masterpiece and with a theme regarding emotions. Riley is a teenage girl struggling with the recent move of her family. Her passion is hockey but her hopes are in the dumps. Inside, her emotions attempt to maintain her sense of being. There is Joy, voiced with good cheer by Amy Poehler, and she tries to maintain the positive. Phyllis Smith voices Sadness whose touch can upset the balance. Bill Hader voices Fear, Mindy Kaling voices Disgust, and Lewis Black steals moments as the tempered voice of Anger. Central plot regards the misplacement of several memories and Joy and Sadness stranded outside headquarters struggling to get back. As Riley falls deeper into a depression, the islands of her brain slowly self destruct. These island include Family, Friendship, Passions, etc. Along the way they encounter Riley's forgotten imaginary friend, Bing Bong who is made up of various animals including elephant, dolphin, cat, etc. He cheerfully helps the duo get to the Train Of Thought but many obstacles prevent them. This is a colourful and creative family adventure that addresses the very core of our being and how we respond to things. Tension constantly builds as Joy and Sadness, and eventually Bing Bong are road blocked constantly by despair before true heroics set in and emotional balance is set. This is another winner by Pixar and it scores on all levels of emotion but mostly joy. That is how viewers will likely react upon seeing it. Score: 10 / 10","

Naturally, each emotion has a distinct colour, shape and personality.I enjoyed the tug of war between the five emotions, and I also enjoyed how two of them go on a road trip in the mind, with core theme islands, train of thought, dreams and subconscious. The animation is an explosion of rainbows and the creativity shown to depict the happenings in the girl's brain is nothing short of amazing, although kids won't understand these ideas.However, it got tedious after awhile and I felt restless. I could feel the audience falling into a rut.

"INSIDE OUT","Metronome11","4 January 2011","Do NOT see this movie unless you are either a Psych major, or have lived a life that is free from sorrow or emotional trauma. As usual Pixar has produced a digital masterpiece, with an inventive plot, original characters, and loads of modern scientific content. However, unfortunately, they chose to depict a young child going through a deep existential crisis, in which all the bases of her emotional world view are shattered, crushed, collapsed, etc. I was sobbing much of the way through, and off and on during the night. About 24 hours later I recovered enough to get back to my normal life activities. In fact it made me want to go back on drugs, to assuage the pain that it dredged up!I advise ""taking a Valium"" beforehand, to minimize the effects of the deep sadness.","

"INSIDE OUT","ThomasDrufke","1 December 2013","It's incredibly difficult to find a film that legitimately succeeds in making you feel all the emotions that it sets out to. I don't think there was a moment in the film where I thought that the film missed on a joke or any of the emotional moments throughout. Quite often you will see a film miss on something, but Inside Out hit on all levels. Quite simply Inside Out is not only a return to form for Pixar, but one of their most imaginative and groundbreaking films. It's up there with Finding Nemo and the Toy Story films as one of my favorites.It tells the story of young Riley, who is forced into a new move from Minnesota to San Francisco and her emotions, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger struggle with the best possible way to treat all the various obstacles that go with a new move. For starters, Riley isn't the prototypical lead girl, she plays hockey, (not to mention that her teeth are not perfectly straight) which you don't often see with a Hollywood picture, and she's just generally an awkward kid. I think this created a much more naturally complicated story of not being able to fit in. I really enjoyed the family aspect of the film. Both the bonding that the emotions do to ultimately become closer, and the presence of Riley's parents. It's one of the first Pixar films that I can remember where we have both parents actually there for the main characters conflicts, and it worked really well. Sometimes it worked to the point where I got teary eyed, which is not abnormal for a Pixar film. But what I thought was more impressive is that the film never relied on something that was overly emotional to bring us to tears. Where Up, Toy Story 3, and Finding Nemo have more dramatic moments, Inside Out is simply about a normal conflict in a little girls path to growing up and moving on. But yet, there were at least 3 moments tear jerker worthy.Much like other Pixar films, I think everyone can get something out of the film at different points in their life. As fun as it is for little kids to watch Joy and Sadness going on an adventure to save Riley's emotional state, it can be equally as interesting for adults to understand what the brain of a pre-teen girl looks like. After all, the director Pete Doctor stated that the film was conceptualized based on his inability to understand his daughter's thoughts. Not only is the story appealing to multiple generations, but they enter into the minds out other people of various ages and demographics throughout the film to create some of the funniest moments in the film. Whether it was the dinner table conversation between parents or when a boy meets Riley and his emotions go bonkers, the film nails emotions on so many levels. This film is so inventive in creating a beautiful world where we can not only potentially learn something about ourselves, but have fun doing it.In addition to having a wonderful story about moving on and accepting change, Inside Out contains some of the coolest Easter eggs and references any Pixar film has to offer. Who thought we would get a Chinatown reference in a kids movie? Or hidden Hitchcock posters in 'Dream Studios', which is also equally as funny as it is a nod to how impeccably true it is of Hollywood. Or what about those barely noticeable newspapers that Anger was reading? Or how can I forget the brilliant voice cast led by Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith. And of course the now veteran Pixar composer Michael Giacchino who gave us yet another beautifully emotional score. Inside Out is one of the most fun summer films and quite possibly best of the year so far. It's near a lock to win best animated feature and a likely candidate for best picture come February. I was beyond impressed by Inside Out.+Hilarious and touching +Giacchino's score +Hidden Easter eggs +Perfect voice cast +Every generation can get something out of it +The kid isn't clichéd at all +Family dynamic 9.4/10","

"INSIDE OUT","geoced","31 July 2020","After the uninspired ""Brave"" and the lazy sequels to ""Cars"" and ""Monsters Inc"", it seemed that Pixar had transferred its talent to Disney and vice versa : ""Wreck-It Ralph"" and ""Big Hero 6"" clearly looked like Pixar productions, with their adult references and geek humour, while ""Brave"" was a traditional (dare I say boring ?) fairy tale and ""Cars 2"" a cheap sequel that Disney could have made. To me, it felt like Pixar was slowly losing the magic that made it stand out.Then came the trailer for Pixar's latest movie, ""Inside Out"", and suddenly hope was renewed ! I thought that it looked very promising and I couldn't wait to see it ! The idea behind the movie is pretty simple : what if we could see what happened inside a person's brain ? While the french TV series ""Il était une fois... la Vie"" did it from a documentary perspective, Pixar opted for a subtle mix of comedy, drama and insightful ideas.While the script may sound simplistic, it actually is really well thought out and everything falls into place perfectly. But the real genius comes from all the wonderful ideas the writers came with to materialize and explain how the human mind works.I'm not going to beat around the bush : this movie is simply brilliant ! The last time Pixar took a risk with a truly innovative idea, they gave us ""Up"", and it was a complete success! It's nice to see that there are still a few writers and producers willing to push fresh ideas to the big screen! My only regret is that it was too short ! I wanted it to last 30 minutes more at least ! They could have expanded their concept a bit more, but at the same time it is true that the movie is quite dense and fast paced : I found myself rewinding or pausing the film several times to pick up all the small but delightful details.""Inside Out"" is a rare example of a movie that I would love to watch a second time right after it finished, and that tells a lot about its quality! For that reason, it definitively deserves a place in my personal top 3 Pixar movies, right there with ""The Incredibles"" and ""WALL-E"". 9/10","

"INSIDE OUT","rgkarim","17 April 2014","We all are victim to our emotions, always susceptible to a tantrum or sobfest that overruled our logical side. The trigger for these outbursts can vary in form, a bad day at school, a breakup with a boyfriend, or in my case sitting through bad movies. Whatever the cause, have you ever stopped to picture what is going on in your mind to cause this? Pixar has, and their latest film has brought those thoughts to life in a way only their studios can. Today I review Inside Out and take a look at what creative sparks lie in their studio. Pixar has been on the sequel train for quite a while, so I was thirsty for a drink from the original pool. Inside Out emerges from that source we fell in love with years ago, and brings it back ten fold in the world of young Riley's (Kaitlyn Dias) mind. Inside Out is a beautiful personification of the inner workings of the mind, filled with colorful visuals that pop off the screen. A high tech ""head""quarters for the cortex looks like something from Star Wars, where futuristic control panels govern all the memories and thoughts that govern our being. Outside command central, Pixar gives you more of their magic in their creations; forming a maze for long term memory, a movie studio as the source of your dreams, and an obvious train for your train of thought. Tacky as some of the puns are, Pixar puts their wit back into the game to design a unique world that is sure to entertain many, as well as become the next theme park attraction. As the emotions transverse the chaos that is our brain, Pixar not only takes you on a physical adventure but an emotional one as well. Of course being a kids movie there are a lot of comedic moments that had me, as well as other audience members, laughing. Slapstick humor involving bodily harm, one liner puns that will appear in memes, and plenty of witty dialogue that represents the internal struggle of indecisiveness. In particular Anger's (Lewis Black) ranting had me laughing the hardest, as the simplistic yelling and rash threats to curse were to my tastes. Sadness (Phyllis Smith) had to be my second favorite, more so in how she presented her lines with that perfect twist of depression to make it funny, and yet sad at the same time. Yet while comedy is a big portion of this movie, Pixar/Disney always manages to bring other emotions into the mix. Seeing as one of the emotions is Sadness, you can guess there are a few moments that can bring tears to your eyes as Riley's memories unfold before your eyes. Joy offsets these moments though, with beautifully crafted sequences that cover those special times in life. And all of it is edited together at just the right times to make the emotions hit home, building slight tension, but delivering a satisfying finish. Pixar represents this emotional instability both inside Riley's mind and outside in her actions, really capturing the look and feel of someone troubled, hence the title. It's balanced well with the humor, and gives older audience members a tether to the film to keep their interest. Voice acting though is the factory that really brings things to life, as each emotion is matched with their voice counterpart. Poehler's optimism shines bright in joy as she rambles off her ideas to keep Riley happy, and you can feel the actress in the character. Phyllis Smith brings her character to life, her whispy voice selling the hopeless emotion, and yet still bringing a comedic edge to her lines that made her humorous. Lewis Black is perfect for anger, his ability to play heavily angry roles where his character consistently yells has been established, and he fits right at home with the emotion he plays so well. Mindy Kaling as Disgust was another good choice, the shallow, image obsessed emotion playing strong to that sassiness we love from her. And Bill Hader cleans up with fear, bringing the anxious tone of fear, while also providing that dry sarcasm. For all the good this movie has there are a few quirks that took away from this movie. The first is a few of the jokes are beaten to death and lose their comedic intensity. In addition the trailers have also given you a lot of the funny moments, which for those who are heavy Disney watchers will be lost from the constant barrage of commercials. As a movie overall, Inside Out has some decent editing, but there are times where the editing needed to be tweaked. The ending of the movie was very drawn out at times, and lacked suspense for me because of the obvious ending to come. I would have liked them to sacrifice some of the prolonged and slower scenes, and give us some glimpses at the personality islands they kept bragging about, or perhaps more time in the darker recesses of the mind. Diving into that creativity may have offset the predictability a bit, and played to the strengths of this movie more. Overall I was impressed with Inside Out and loved to see Pixar's classic performance shine once more. Audience members of all ages are sure to enjoy this film, with the younger generations laughing in high shrills and the older appreciating the emotional side of things. It holds that creative magic we love of Disney, and keeps you entertained despite some of the longer moments. While not the best, Inside Out certainly shows promise for the studio's future works and more fun adventures to be had. I would say it is worth a trip to the theater for any age group and strongly recommend you see this film. My scores are:Animation/Comedy/Drama: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0","

"INSIDE OUT","jadepietro","25 January 2011","(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4) This film is recommended.In brief: Insightful and thought-provoking, but not as mind-blowing as expected.GRADE: BCritics have been raving about the latest Disney / Pixar offering, Inside Out. While it doesn't take one to the dizzying heights of animation perfection like the award-winning Holy Trinity of Animation (Toy Story, Up, and Ratatouille), it still is entertaining and insightful, far better than most standard animated films these days. ￼Literally, the moviegoers are given a introspective tour into the mind of an 11 year old girl named Riley. This fantastic voyage takes us into the brain's central work station manned by Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling). This quartet of emotions help keep Riley in balance.That is until Riley's outside world starts to come undone with real-life issues changing her life. Inside, things are beginning to disintegrate as well when Sadness accidentally starts a domino effect that alters Riley's behavior and mood swings. (The fact that Riley is headed for those teenage angst years doesn't help matters either.) So Joy takes over to try and rectify this imbalance causing even more issues.￼Well directed by Pete Docter and co-directed by Ronaldo Del Carmen, Inside Out is animation with adults in mind. The screenplay by Meg LeFauve, Josh Cooley, and the director, takes an intriguing premise but never fully succeeds in expanding its mind games. And while the intentions are good, the end result is a bit scattered. With all the language about core memories, deductive reasoning, and abstract thinking being bantered about, one wonders if a psychology major is required for the minors in the audience. The film's target audience may have been children, but only those with the highest of IQ's. The voice-over work is consistently strong, especially Poehler, Smith, and Kaitlyn Dias as Riley. However, while some of the emotions are well defined like Joy and Sadness, the other trio is regulated to secondary roles that are less nuanced. Other major emotions are never even represented or acknowledged for that matter. Paging Sigmund!￼The real scene stealer of the film (in Freudian terms, our Id) is Bing Bong (wonderful vocal work too by Richard Kind), a pink confection of cotton candy and various animal parts who cries candy tears and was once Riley's imaginary best friend. This character is the heart of the film and the emotional center of Inside Out. The film laments the loss of childhood in the subtlest of ways and effectively taps into any moviegoer's emotional ""core"". ￼The film's animation is as highly accomplished as we expect from the Disney / Pixar Studios. Its textural details and imaginative Rube Goldberg devices show the inter-workings of a child's mind with its floating islands, glowing orbs, and neon lit chutes and ladders...a Disneyland for the mind. Its stylized humans have enough realistic touches to make their characters seem authentic especially in sharp contrast to the cartoon qualities of the more obviously color-coded crew. The musical score by the talented Michael Giacchino superbly links its haunting melodies with the visual images on display. It is also refreshing that this film never resorts to inane slapstick chases and sophomoric humor, so prevalent in today's animation.￼Inside Out shows the ins and outs of growing up in a refreshing and intelligent way in which adults can easily relate while their young children will pass the time wondering why their parents are enjoying the film more than they are.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com","

"INSIDE OUT","Lejink","21 April 2011","I don't know but sometimes I felt as if I needed a degree in psychology to fully join up the thought processes which not only went together to create this acclaimed Disney / Pixar movie but also that went on inside the mind of the animated young girl Riley at the centre of the action.Ambitious it certainly was, attempting the fine balance which all Pixar films strive to achieve between providing the cartoon fun beloved of young children and the sophistication demanded of the adult who more than likely has to accompany their child to the movie. I don't know if the five key emotions identified and depicted here of joy, sadness, disgust, fear and anger would be the ones I'd identify as primary to a pre-teen child, and once joy and sadness exited their main functions, I struggled a little to explain some of the motivations and choices made by the three remaining, competing feelings.Again maybe it's me but I also didn't quite follow either the journey of the two dominant emotions back to the central cortex as it were and wondered a little if some of the characters they met along the way weren't just inserted for promotional tie-in purposes. I'd also argue that every child experiences a different mind-set as they grow up and didn't accept the applied generalised psychoanalysis here.Okay, maybe all this means that cynicism would be one of the guiding traits in my own mind but even in the wider picture the film didn't really reach out to me in the usual Pixar manner in terms of humour or emotion. There were occasional humorous but not hilarious moments and certainly some lovely and lively animation to see but for me it all went a little above my head leaving my mind-set at the end in neutral.","

"INSIDE OUT","Anurag-Shetty","28 December 2011","Inside Out tells the story of Riley(Kaitlyn Dias). Ever since she was born, Riley has had a great life. She has a loving Mom(Diane Lane) & Dad(Kyle MacLachlan), great friends & she loves playing hockey. Riley's various emotions, Joy(Amy Poehler), Sadness(Phyllis Smith), Fear(Bill Hader), Anger(Lewis Black) & Disgust(Mindy Kaling) help navigate her everyday life. However, Riley's perfect life turns upside down when she moves with her family to San Francisco on account of her dad's new job, leaving behind the life she knows & loves in Minnesota. Now, it is up to her emotions, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger & Disgust to effectively control Riley's feelings in a new & unfamiliar city. Inside Out is an unbelievably unique & incredible film! Never before in the history of cinema, has a movie ever delved so deep into the various emotions of the human mind. Since this movie is animated, there couldn't be a more fun & creative way to showcase the various aspects of a young girl's mind & imagination. Pixar has created yet another flawless masterpiece. This film is by far, their most original & creative story, yet. Being a Disney/Pixar movie, my expectations for Inside Out were sky high. Despite the presence of emotions like, Sadness, Anger & Disgust, my only emotion while watching this movie was Joy, Joy & more Joy. The animation is of the highest standard. The inside of Riley's mind is colorful, full of life & is a visual treat. The 3D adds to the overall experience of an already wonderful film. Director Pete Doctor is at his creative best for Inside Out. The way Doctor has conjured up this story that mostly takes place in a girl's mind, shows how staggeringly brilliant he is. This film is so powerful that, I actually teared up during the final moments of the film. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of comedic scenes in the movie. The voice acting is top notch. Amy Poehler is a bundle of energy as Joy. Phyllis Smith is perfect as the hilariously lethargic & unenthusiastic Sadness. Richard Kind is adorable as Bing Bong. Bill Hader is hysterical as Fear. Lewis Black is vicious as Anger. Mindy Kaling is awesome as Disgust. Kaitlyn Dias is superb as Riley. Diane Lane & Kyle MacLachlan are great as Mom & Dad respectively. The supporting characters are impressive. Inside Out is a must watch for people of all ages(with a little bit of explanation for kids aged 9 & below). Pete Doctor has really outdone himself after Up(2009). The best Disney/Pixar movie & one of the best animated movies of all time. Inside Out is definitely a lock for Best Animated Film at the Oscars. I wouldn't be surprised if it got nominated for Best Film too.","

"INSIDE OUT","Tweekums","31 December 2020","This Disney/Pixar film is primarily set in the head of eleven year old Riley Andersen where five emotions; Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear and Anger are based. They live in 'Head Quarters' from where they control her temperament and help organise her memories. Overall they are primarily joyful but when her family moves away from her friends in Minnesota to a new home and a new life in San Francisco things start to go wrong. As Riley goes to her new school for the first time Sadness accidentally causes her to cry in front of her new classmates and for the first time a sad core memory is created. Joy tries to stop it being processed and in the process disrupts the other core memories deactivating Riley's 'personality islands'. As Joy struggles with Sadness the two of them and the core memories and removed from Head Quarters; this leaves Disgust, Fear and Anger trying to control Riley's emotions with disastrous results if Joy and Sadness can't get back with the core memories Riley will suffer permanent emotional damage.I had heard that this film was something very special long before I eventually watched it for me it definitely lived up to the hype. It is rather appropriate that a film about emotions is one of the most emotional I've seen for some time and fittingly, given that Joy and Sadness are the main characters, I shed tears of both joy and sadness before it was over. The creators did a beautiful job anthopomorphising the emotions in a way that created a story that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike. The voice actors do a fine job bringing these characters, as well as the human characters, to life. The story is told at a good pace and there are some gentle scares as well as some loss; particularly in an emotional scene of self-sacrifice involving Riley's previously forgotten imaginary friend. While it is sad at times there are just as many joyful moments as well as some good laughs. Overall I'd definitely recommend this film to people of all ages; I've only just watched it but want to watch it again soon.","

Centred on an 11-year-old girl's internal struggle between joy and sadness, with a bit of anger, fear and disgust thrown in for good measure, this gorgeously animated effort is sweet, smart and often hilarious. Anyone who manages not to be swept up in the bundle of melancholic sweetness of Sadness has a heart of stone. It took Pixar years to fully realise their physical interpretation of a human's inner workings, and the enormous amount of time, effort and thought they dedicated to it was worth every second.","

The movie only stars like 4 or 5 emotions in people's heads, 4 or 5, I forgot, and frankly don't care since this movie was complete garbage. I ""watched"" this movie at a potluck at a friend's house but ended up playing ping pong with a friend the whole time since the movie failed to attract my attention. This movie is not suitable for kids as well. I do not understand why it is on the IMDb top 250 list, it should be on the bottom 100 list. This movie can scar kids and make some people actually depressed. It is quite depressing that there are such limited emotions and little activity in the brain expressed in the movie. I was actually depressed after watching this movie and found myself in a bitter state lacking interest in activities I usually cherish. Why? Because this stupid movie is trying to tell me what is in my brain and is completely corrupting. I was emotionless after the movie just like how the movie is. I'm sure the disgust emotion in the movie would be disgusted at the movie.","

We have babies and some sappy family moments and some weird explanations that nobody can understand. But then they move from Minnesota to San Francisco. Ok, I'm from Minnesota, MINNESOTA IS SO NICE! WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO LEAVE! (That's probably why they had us watch it) Then the girl starts having a mental breakdown and Happy and Sad are sucked out of a tube.... and it just gets weirder from there..... they end up in a tunnel and have to make their way back to to the tower. So Happy and Sad walk and find this stupid elephant guy who claims to be able to guide them through the maze but just gets them stuck in some wierd chamber where the animation styles start changing. (I'll stick with Spider-Verse for clashing animation) Then there is this boring side plot with the girl and Angry, Disgusting, and Fear. Then there is some more weird stuff in between and then the 11 YEAR OLD girl decides to use a CREDIT CARD to go back to Minnesota! What? How does that work? I dunno but then the end happens and I have no idea what happened because I didn't understand it. I just don't understand what's happened to Pixar, they used to be so good.

This is the part when all begins to go wrong and only the two main feelings can help her, if they actually manage to get back to the place where they belong.It's a very sentimental movie which presents the adventures of two characters as they try to find their way back through an endless maze filled with long-term memories. It's mostly sad and suspenseful, contrary to what I was expecting, briefly changing the mood from time to time with a funny sequence. I would have preferred a more joyful movie considering the premise it had, this way making it easier for everyone to enjoy. I had the impression I was watching a drama rather than a colorful and cheerful animation, which, by the way, was top notch as usual. Don't get me wrong, it's still a very good animation but pretty far away from the elite, unfortunately.","

As it involves an eleven-year old girl Riley. She has to move from MN to SF as she is sad to move from her own home. As her dad has a job with a start up company. Though Joy the main emotion for Riley but Sadness, not treated like an equal, as Sadness on accident gives way to the young girl moving. Her parents say that she is getting an attitude. But it is really just her being sad from moving away from her friends and what she has known. As Joy gets sucked out of headquarters along with Sadness as they were butting heads over her emotions over the move. Now both must put aside their differences and try to work things out and get Riley over her emotions and moving.Really one of the best Pixar movies ever made. It does show we have emotions.

"INSIDE OUT","scottshak_111","6 December 2010","Inside Out is definitely one of animation's biggest benchmarks in the history of the animated. So good a movie! It is not just entertainment, it is edutainment. If you pay attention you would be logically thrilled as well. It is like the inception of animation. Only simpler to understand yet intricate at so many levels!This has to be placed amongst the greats. Not only is this movie extremely hilarious, it is also very dramatic, highly educative, and morally impeccable.Taking up two big plots simultaneously in the vanguard was a Herculean task per se. But Pete Doctor and Ronaldo Del Carmen merge them just fine to weave an excellent coming-of-age story of Riley whose life decisions are technically controlled by voices in her head. We have Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust that literally define the head of our protagonist.The concept is simply outstanding. Notions that define how we feel have been brought to life by Pixar's amazing animation and they look downright perfect. Thoughts, memories, imagination, sub-conscious every area of a human brain has been beautifully and subtly portrayed using humorous characters as props. Watch out for the adorable Bing Bong!The drama is absolutely melting. So warm and so right that it beats every non-animated drama flick to pulp. The Bing Bong fate and the gloom of the memory dump are the most melodramatic bits in the movie that would uproot your heart away.Michael Giacchino's music is simply amazing. The composition is quite soothing. He stops playing his notes at dramatic bits for emphasis and then lightens up the mood, after the grim passes. Really thoughtful!There are valued lessons strewn all across the movie that just feels so right, and have been exploited in the right amounts. Humour is always lurking around in the corner even in the direst of circumstances and you end up laughing every time. Amy Poehler's voice makes Joy, well you know, joyous. Phyllis Smith's voice as Sadness is quite endearing. Bill, Diane, Kyle and Richard just make everything better.Oh and there is an amazing short called Lava that plays in the beginning! Giving you a heads up there! Exceptional stuff!","

"INSIDE OUT","dwyde_shryde","10 July 2021","The previews were intriguing: the creative genius of Pixar tackling the human psyche on a fundamental level. Unfortunately, this film dragged on with very little plot or substance. The anthropomorphic representations of emotion and memory are cute, but ultimately fail to provide the kind of sustained entertainment experience of other Pixar films. Basically, it seemed like enough story to fill out a short - repeated several times to make a feature.Perhaps the film does capture the essence of pre-teen, middle class white girl angst - and it does have a few very poignant moments - but ultimately, it lacks the layered humor, well directed action, and general entertainment value that I have come to expect from Pixar.On a brighter note, the short that preceded this film, ""Lava"", was awesome!","

"INSIDE OUT","billygoat1071","8 January 2021","Pixar returns to their high-concept roots with Inside Out, showing us how emotions work through the human mind in a whimsically metaphorical way. It's the kind of idea that Pixar would definitely take at some point as they have always been bringing us a variety of emotions in their films. This movie explores childhood and growing up into the perspective of a little girl's mind, how the emotions get confused by the changes in life and how they have to gain back the light. Inside Out represents this angst with a delightful, yet profound adventure; which indeed results to a totally heartwarming experience.This concept explores emotions, personalities and imaginations of an individual, but the film's focus is an 11-year-old girl named Riley who moves to a new city with her family, but troubles to adapt and letting go. This made the emotions trying to avoid her from sadness, but instead lead her primal emotions to get lost somewhere that stores her long-term memory. And this does indicate the idea of being overly attached to the past, but also tells that growing up requires moving on and accepting whatever life would take you to. And this also went to a stronger and sophisticated turn, which is mainly about the purpose of every emotion and the benefit of expressing them, whether it seems good or bad. The movie smartly puts these ideas together as a whimsical journey of learning to understand whatever circumstance you are facing, but also examines the shortcomings of being dishonest to your own feelings.And again, these ideas are represented as an adventure with a lot of laughs and creativity to follow through. Aside of its thematic core, it also explores how dreams are made, how fears become exaggerated form of nightmares, how prominent memories also hook stuff that you don't necessarily need like commercial songs, and how imaginary places and friends come to life and interact with the emotions. It's a fun atmosphere to look around. The characters are delightful. Even if they're supposed to represent a single emotion, they brought more personalities than they should. The voice acting is wondrous: Amy Poehler brings a sense of lovable optimism in Joy and Phyllis Smith gives earnestness to Sadness. While Bill Hader adds low-key charm as Fear, Mindy Kaling gives the attitude as Disgust, and Lewis Black mostly stealing every scene as Anger.Inside Out is great, firstly because it's Pixar returning to their creativity and profoundness towards their stories, secondly is it's just really smart. It takes a simple idea and sprinkle it with colorful imagination, clever details of its world, totally likable characters, and a really beautiful portrayal of valuing what you honestly feel in life and learning the importance of it. It's a warmer message than it may sound, because that is the true essence of growing up. Everything else is just an engaging candy that would make you laugh, cry and hope. Welcome back, Pixar! The real spirit of Pixar, to be more specific!","

"INSIDE OUT","Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd","13 February 2011","My Thoughts:When I first saw the trailer for Inside Out I had high hopes and who wouldn't Pixar is a studio that really hasn't let me down. I don't mean that all there movies are great but at least they were entertaining. But I am sad to say that era has ended for me. Inside Out just doesn't live up to its former predecessors.I told one of my fellow screeners last night this was a mediocre rehash of Toy Story just with the toys now being inside the child's head. Riley's family move from Minnesota to San Fransisco and of course nothing is going as it should be the house doesn't live up to the hype Riley dreamed up, the movers are lost and keep pushing back the delivery date, and of course the dreaded new school.Then we have the emotions inside Riley's head who instead of coming together and getting Riley through this they are in conflict with each other which leads to Riley losing focus on who she is and what made her her which leads Riley down a dark path.Now why do I say that this movie does not live up to the Pixar movies that came before? Pixar is usually good at balancing adult and kid humor making it fun for the whole family to sit down and watch the movie and sadly I feel that Inside Out did not do this. There were certain scenes that I was sitting there bored with. Some scenes just didn't make any sense whatsoever, making it feel like they threw stuff in there so they could pad the run time. Don't get me wrong there was some humorous scenes that I enjoyed in this movie, especially some of the end credit outtakes but overall I just feel this movie lacked anything really new to the scene. Like I stated before I feel we have seen this storyline in some form or another just this time they are using emotions as the point of view vice toys, etc.Now the kids that were in the audience seemed to enjoy this movie overall. As I said before it does go a little dark, kind of like Toy Story 3 but I think they went a little further. So at least if you are taking your kids out to see this they should be entertained I can't say the same for all the adults out there. Also there is really no point in the 3D glasses nothing really jumped out at me making me glad to see this movie in 3D. Heck 3/4ths of the way through the movie I remembered that I was actually wearing the glasses.I know that this is the first really kid movie of the summer and families are probably going to flock to it. And most likely those that love Disney and Pixar are going to see it as well. I hope that they find more enjoyment in it than I did. My Recommendation:Rent It.","

"INSIDE OUT","mrcibubur","29 September 2020","I am surprised so many people have reviewed this film with such negativity. As a mature individual well plus 21, I watched this movie with my wife and youngest child who is aged four. We all laughed all the way through.Sometimes, I wonder what people expect from a movie. Here we have an imaginative story line which truly gets into the mind of a young child with joy sadness fear anger and disgust.Yes, the characters for Mother and Father are a little stereotyped and there are moments in the film when you could easily feel disappointed or depressed but those moments are short and overall the film holds the attention of the audience from beginning to end.The storyline is simplistic and touching, nothing overly American about it, dealing with a child moving far away from home and looking at the problems she faces at home and at school in a fun and challenging way.This is no doubt a film aimed at a mixed audience of parent and child and teenagers too might find the topic of interest when looking at those five basic emotions applied to themselves.There are a lot of mediocre films about which fall well below the mark and not many in the category of family entertainment which are appealing across the generation divide. In my view, this one will appeal.It was the weekend, the film was recommended to me. It was a perfectly good moral film with a sound storyline and easy to follow. I did not have to think too much on any of the issues raised in the film. Younger children would not grasp the point made in the morality stakes but who cares so long as everyone who goes to see the film can eat their popcorn in safety and have a few laughs? Well, nearly everyone!","

"INSIDE OUT","dave_herlihy","18 January 2014","This movie was built up by the trailers and I was actually excited to see it. The fact of the matter is that this movie is boring and not worth seeing. How major movie critics almost unanimously gave this movie positive reviews really makes no sense. Googling reviews for this movie proves to be much more telling than the scores it received on ""reputable"" websites. The scores are overblown because people were being generous with negative scores and way too generous with positive reviews by giving perfect scores to this mess of a movie. If you want to watch a movie and feel really uncomfortable this is for you. The emotions are forced at the viewer and explained by a plot that falls apart like the memories in the movie. Unfortunately my memory of this movie will remain.","

"INSIDE OUT","CinemaClown","22 May 2020","A swashbuckling return to form for Pixar Animation Studios, Inside Out arrives as a strong jolt of freshness from the talented minds responsible for groundbreaking classics like Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille & WALL·E, commences the studio's long- awaited resurgence towards its lost glory, and in the process also reaffirms why Pixar is the most beloved, respected & finest animation studio on the planet.One of the most original, creative, intelligent, stunning & brightest ideas to come out from Pixar's repertoire in a very long time, Inside Out brims with sufficient dosage of intriguing concept, engaging storyline, rich characters, heartfelt emotions, gorgeous animation, stellar voice-cast & evocative score, and is an amalgamation of everything that has contributed in this famed studio's meteoric rise to the pinnacle of the animation film industry.A heartfelt tale about the difficulties of growing-up, Inside Out follows Riley: a young girl whose life hits a bumpy road when she is uprooted from her Midwest lifestyle after her father begins a new job in San Francisco, following which her emotions — Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust & Fear, work together in an effort to navigate her through this tough phase and help her adjust to her new life in the new city, house & school while Joy does her best to keep her happy.Co-written & directed by Pete Docter, Inside Out hits a third consecutive home-run for the director of Monsters, Inc. & Up, for it not only works as an inventive & imaginative feature film from the creative filmmaker but also succeeds as one of the most ambitious & audacious film projects undertaken by Pixar. The screenplay also wonderfully intertwines the two story lines set within the same picture; one concerning Riley while other following her emotions.Production Design team does a splendid job in creating the world for the emotions to reside in. Even those emotions are cleverly imagined, designed & rendered on the screen, and it's easy to identify one from its shape & colour alone. Cinematography makes excellent use of camera to capture every action in fine detail while its colour palette makes exquisite use of five different hues, each associated with a certain emotion, whose shades are applied to the whole world within the mind.Editing unfolds its narrative steadily & its 94 minutes of runtime is briskly paced. The score is composed by Michael Giacchino but isn't as memorable as I expected. The performance by its voice cast continues Pixar's tradition of coming up with a fitting ensemble that infuses new life into its animated characters and amongst all, it's Amy Poehler & Phyllis Smith (the voices of Joy & Sadness, respectively) who impress the most, share a wonderful chemistry, and are the very soul of Inside Out.But despite getting most things right, Inside Out isn't without its flaws for there are a few elements that don't work out in its favour. First is its attempt at humour which at times feels forced. Next up is Riley's imaginary friend Bing Bong who is pretty annoying for the most part. Michael Giacchino's score is a letdown too as mentioned above. And finally, there's this contrast between its seemingly childish humour & the subject matter that's more oriented towards grown-ups, which hinders the overall enjoyment on few occasions.On an overall scale, Inside Out is the strongest Pixar film to surface on the big screen since Toy Story 3 that guarantees to take its viewers through every emotion and absolutely delivers on that promise. It shows that growing-up isn't always a fun, carefree experience and also illustrates the importance of sadness in our life as well as the changes any emotion can trigger in our behaviour. I'd been waiting a long time for Pixar to come up with a cinema like this & while it may not be as perfect as their finest works, it's destined to become a Pixar classic in the years to come. Don't miss it.","

"INSIDE OUT","rcolgan","11 May 2012","Do you ever look at someone and wonder, ""What is going on inside their head?"" Well, the reality is the answers pretty dull. It's just a big brain sending messages across your body to determine your actions. But in the minds of the creators at Pixar the answer has no limits, with every persons head containing a fully functioning world, where small beings create and store every idea and memory we have in life. And at the centre of this world is a control panel, similar to something like the deck of the Enterprise, which is controlled by our emotions that lead us through every decision we make in our lives. Inside Out follows a girl named Riley (Katilyn Dias) and the five emotions that lead her every action- Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Riley's most important emotion that has shaped all of Riley's core memories that make her the person she is, Joy (Amy Pohler). They all care for Riley and one another like one big family, always looking to give Riley the best life she can have. This includes everything from remembering to avoid Broccoli to maintaining Riley's goofy attitude to remain her parents happy little girl. But Riley is entering a difficult period in her life of great change. She is moving to a new home in San Francisco, leaving her friends behind, and her father has become too busy with work to look after her the way he used to. This causes the emotions to conflict on the best way to deal with it, with the ensuing chaos causing Joy and Sadness to get lost in the furthest reaches of Riley's mind and forcing them to go on a journey to return to the control room, or Riley might never be happy again. In some ways the film is a nice reminder of how even after 20 years, Pixar has stuck to what made them so engaging to audiences to begin with. The journey that Joy and Sadness go on is a great buddy travel movie, that's in a similar vein to Buzz and Woody in 'Toy Story'. And just like 'Toy Story', Pixar has continued to remain focused on developing memorable characters that will help shape many childhoods, with the likes of Joy's energetic personality and simplistic but lovable design bound to stick in our heads the same way that Buzz Lightyear did when 'Toy Story' was first released. But in other ways the film is a reminder to show how far both Pixar and CGI animation has come, with the worlds Pixar's movies take place in going from the constraints of a child's bedroom to creating an entire world within the mind of a child. And the world that they create is something truly special. Other films have taken place in a person's mind in the past with their own distinct styles, from the epic mind bending action of 'Inception' to the fragmenting chaos in 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'. But no other film has ever approached the inner workings of a mind with the same creativity as Pixar has. The film includes as much as it could of developing how a mind works and what an 11 year old girl would be thinking about, incorporating it as either a great gag or as a way the world is designed to function. There's a literal train of thought that's able to carry memories across Riley's mind, a place called Déjà vu that keeps popping up, and even a dream centre that operates like a movie studio to give Riley something to watch at night. Even small sayings like getting a song stuck in your head are incorporated in to the film in some of Pixars funniest running gags to date. Plus I'm relatively certain that anyone who's seen the film will be humming Triple Dent Gum for the rest of their lives. As always, at the films heart remains the human drama that has kept Pixar movies so relatable over the years. In one of the most touching scenes, we watch as Joy turns on one of Riley's treasured childhood memories of her skating to pick up her spirits and slowly begins to skate with her in perfect synch. It's a beautiful moment where we're shown both the close bond that Riley and her emotions share, whilst reminding us all on the way we all hold on to out childhood in a way that only Pixar can.It's moments like this that can be universally related to, mixed with Pixar's stunning animation and their ability to create such original worlds that ensures Inside Out is another addition to Pixar's constantly growing collection of treasured classics.","

"INSIDE OUT","drawlife","27 November 2010","This movie was a hard sell. I liked the first sneak peek of the preview of this film, but I wasn't really feeling the other trailers and the marketing campaign overall. But to it's credit this movie is a hard movie to sell without spoiling anything. I really enjoyed this film. I think Pixar found their groove back with Inside Out after misfires like Brave and the Cars franchise. But with that being said, what Pixar is great at is making movies, not just for kids, but for adults as well. The exterior of the films seem like for kids, but the interior has many layers and depth. This film allows you to feel the emotions you see on screen, who are the emotions of a girl named Riley(Kaitlyn Dias). The whole cast is stellar, Joy voiced by Amy Poehler carries this film, I was very concerned if I can get on board with a character who is happy all the time throughout the whole film, but Poehler and her character manages to do so. Phyllis Smith is Sadness and she is terrific, I found her to be a tad annoying in the beginning, but she won me over. I liked the other supporting emotions, Mindy Kaling provides sassiness as Disgust and Lewis Black as Anger provides some humorous moments as well, but my favorite out of all is Bill Hader's Fear. He was great. The parents portrayed by Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan provide decent supporting roles. How the creative minds of Pixar came up with this conceptually complicated film is beyond me. Give director/writer Pete Docter, who also wrote Wall-E and Up, credit where credit is due. The story is almost perfectly constructed. I say almost, because the beginning starts off so well and it's thrilling, just to see the concept become realized in just a few minutes kicked the film off in high gear. What bogged the story down a little is when Joy and Sadness end up getting lost within the large maze of Riley's brain/memory trying to get back into the control room. That is where the film looses some momentum. I didn't particularly love Richard Kind's Bing Bong, but he was my least favorite character of the bunch, but he is used very effectively, and to those who saw it, you know what I'm talking about. It's just a tiny nitpick but I just wish they allowed the idea to carry the film itself rather than have this middle act, again it wasn't a huge detriment, just a nitpick as it eventually picks up steam again. This is Pixar's most ambitious and most subtly intelligent film yet. Not since Toy Story 3 have I enjoyed a film this much by them. Again, I'm going to sound like a broken record, but Pixar really knows how to tell a story. Yes they do have some misfires, but their track record is solid. I'm not the target demographic for these films, but they continue to turn up solid, dependable, and consistent entertainment. This film hits the right notes on another level. The conceptual level this film operates on is a pleasure to watch on screen. This movie is very thought-provoking and is filled with awesome and clever metaphors that never gets complicated at all. It explains emotional states very well disguised as a kid's film and sends a great message that not just that everyone has emotions, but it cannot be one emotion all the time and every time, and each emotion has it's place. It's an easy film to relate to, and to be honest I sincerely believe that adults might enjoy this film a little more than kids. Inside Out is easily in Pixar's top five or ten list. 9/10","

Pixar's genius is sterling again with the latest instant classic from the studio that keeps making you wish you were a kid again. This time probing the mind of a young girl named Riley (Dia) whose recent move with her family has her emotions under siege with new memories and attempts to retain 'core' ones as well. In charge is Joy (ever peppy Poehler), Sadness (dour Smith), Fear (frantic Hader), Anger (stereotyped Black) and Disgust (Kaling at full tilt) all bucking for control until Joy & Sadness find themselves ousted from headquarters (get it?) and racing to get back to keep things normal in spite of the odds. Funny, warm and poignant and a visual feast for the eyes (great fun spoofing artistry of all types once Riley's imaginary friend Bing Bong (fun Kind) enters the picture to aid the bickering feelings. Veteran director Pete Docter co-directs with Ronaldo Del Carmen (who penned the lively script with Meg LeFauve & Josh Cooley) with wild abandon.

It is a totally family movie. The movie teaches bonding, friendship, honesty. While entertaining, Inside out also teaches the meaning of Life. This movie definitely deserves an Oscar.

"INSIDE OUT","shadowyx12","13 August 2016","THE SHORT OF IT: While watching 'Inside Out', I came to the realization that the film contains common plot elements seen in past Pixar films (especially Docter's previous two films). If you've seen 'Monsters Inc.' and 'Up', then you'll eventually see that this film is just a rehash of those two films combined. However, some people say that Pixar's latest offering stole its concept from an obscure '90s sitcom called 'Herman's Head'. And some even say that this film is a complete rip-off of the 2009 Japanese manga 'Nounai Poison Berry' (and its live-action adaptation that also came out this year).For those people (and to myself), I just want to say one thing: deal with it. Like Picasso said, ""Good artists copy, great artists steal."" And Pixar did a great job stealing this idea and making it their own.With that being said, 'Inside Out' is still wildly original, universally relatable, and incredibly moving. The animation is beautiful as always, the story is well paced, and there are very few moments where the humour feels strange and off-putting (there's also a joke for you 'Chinatown' fans out there). Don't feel like you need to bring a little kid with you just to see this film – Pixar has proved time and time again in the past that they are some of Hollywood's best storytellers and has done so yet again with 'Inside Out'.This truly stands as one of the BEST 'coming-of-age (or puberty)' films that has been released in the past five years.P.S. Those with kids younger than nine should probably be warned that this film does get pretty dark (for a kid's movie) at the 2/3rd mark.","

"INSIDE OUT","js-phillips","30 January 2021","My daughter came to me this weekend and said we HAD to see Inside Out. I'm a big movie guy and usually get a kick out of kids movies because of the beautiful animation and witty comedy. When I read this was a Pixar movie and saw many of the rave reviews I was all in.It started out with a great premise. Little girl (Riley) is born as an only child to a loving family living in Minnesota. We are introduced to the lead character, Joy, who is part of the team that provides Riley with all of her emotions. Joy is exactly as the name describes, she provides the Joy for Riley. However, we are also introduced to Sadness, Fear, and Disgust.Inside of Riley's mind is a complex system of ""personality islands,"" thought trains, memory storage systems, and a crew in charge of sending forgotten about memories to a ""dump"" where the memories are forever forgotten. Basically, Joy is an overachiever who feels it is her duty to control Riley's emotions 90% of the time while limiting the control of the other emotions. Nothing wrong with that as we all would like our kids to be joyous 90% of the time. Shortly after we establish a relationship with Riley, the director decides to move the family to a dump in the middle of San Francisco. From here the story just tumbles downhill. Sadness begins to take over the control room, touching different memories and causing Riley to fall into early stages of depression. As Joy begins to sense this downward spiral things go wrong in the control room and one way or another Joy and Sadness are sent to the inner reaches of Riley's mind.I won't follow the details from here on out as I only have a 1,000 word limit. From this point on (from about the 30 minute mark), this movie takes the audience through constant peril and depression as Joy struggles to get her and sadness back to the control room. Constant failure, constant heartbreak. This whole time Riley continues to tumble deeper into a state of depression.The audience watched the next hour in a state of stunned silence. Nobody made a peep. I was very tempted to end this torture and grab my daughter and leave the theater. I cannot believe a movie like this was green lit, and let alone sent out by Pixar. My only hope for this review is that it helps keep families with high hopes away from going to this movie. It truly is a depressing movie and I heard more tears than laughter. I can't understand how that would get rave reviews. People's lives are hard enough as it is. To try and escape at the movies and see something like this is wrong.Animation was great, not worth sitting through something as heartbreaking as this.","

The trailers made it seem funny, and it was a little, but when you constantly hear cry's from your own child and other children around the theater, it made you want to leave. In fact, my five year old asked to leave twice during the movie. How much sadness can you put into a family movie? There is a big dose of sadness at the beginning. Then things really fall apart which is sad. Then things vanish which makes you sad. Then something is sacrificed and things are sad again. But sadness is OK..., right? No, not when you want to see a comedy. If you want to see a funny movie, watch the Minions, but not this movie.","

"INSIDE OUT","Diogo_Costa","14 April 2011","After five years of relatively fine, solid releases, but with some missteps along the way, Pixar rises again and returns to its former glory with Inside Out.Inside Out runs on the tracks of an apparently straightforward plot of a possible life-changing event for young Riley to present a wonderful display of creativity and imagination, maybe the best from the studio.Human psychology is the setting where emotions come to life to tell the story of the chaotic and somewhat abstract events occurring inside Riley's head with exceptional attention to detail and an impressive clarity. Between nods to the studio's classics and the work of Hayao Miyazaki, everything is carefully thought and perfectly executed, adding an incredible depth and complexity to the amusing spectacle. From all charm and fun to its heart-breaking moments and bittersweet realizations, there is no doubt that Inside Out deserves a place among the likes of Wall-E or UP. And although it suffers from a lack of a toys-holding-hands-in-a-furnace moment, Inside Out winds up to stand out as the most daring and inventive Pixar film to date - and one of my favorite displays of apathy ever.","

"INSIDE OUT","angelahptrio","2 June 2013","Definitely a tearjerker for any age. It is a fun family film but with so much depth. Kids will enjoy it for the character as emotions and the colors of the world inside Riley's mind. However, adults will like it because it has a hidden message for all ages, but probably more so for adults than children. I believe it is a secret movie for adults because of the hidden message. The message is it's not healthy to keep your sadness bottled up inside. If you ignore sadness, you might go into depression which is what Riley goes through. This was out in 2015 before everyone else preached mental health awareness. This was probably a first hint maybe it's a good idea to let out your emotions to heal your wounds.","

"INSIDE OUT","Al_The_Strange","31 August 2011","The human mind is a complex labyrinth of mental processes, conscious and unconscious thoughts, emotions, memories, and more. It's a muscle that's always working in complicated ways to ensure our survival in day-to-day interactions, and for human beings in particular, this extends to emotional well-being, socializing, rationalizing, communicating, and more. Few people, if any, fully understand how the human brain fully works; it's just always there, and the voices in our heads are always there to guide us through life. With Pixar's film Inside Out, filmmakers cleverly interpret neuroscience into a whole new universe where emotions are characters, memories are objects to be stored and used, and their interactions are what cause people to act the way they do.In spite of the premise, the film definitely employs some imaginative world-building, featuring visually fantastic scenes where a person's mind is a surreal fantasy world akin to Alice in Wonderland (which in itself could be interpreted as a mental thing anyway). Within the mind of one little girl, there are ""personality islands"" that represents Riley's values; there's a literal ""train of thought"" that appears; there's a zone where ""abstract thought"" turns the characters into literally abstract figures; there's a film studio that makes dreams; and so much more. It's a clever way to translate what we know of the brain into literal places that are visually impressive and sometimes funny. What brings the mental landscape to life will be the characters though - the interaction between all the emotions creates plenty of hilarious comedy between themselves, and causes people to react in funny ways too. Altogether, the movie is just as cute, funny, and imaginative as Toy Story and Monsters Inc. were.The story has two different narratives working for it. On one level, it's the simple story about Riley, the girl who has to move from rural Minnesota to San Francisco, and has to cope with all the stress of leaving behind home and living in a new place. In her head is where the bulk of the film's adventure takes place, in which Riley's Joy and Sadness both go missing and have to find their way back to headquarters before the other emotions mess up Riley's life for good. It's a pretty lightweight story on both accounts, with subtle levels of conflict. What makes the film compelling will be the characters, both external and internal. It is consistently fun to watch the emotions, for even though they are one-dimensional, their personalities clash and react in dynamic ways. Thanks to their relationships, Riley and her family are brought to life in a perfectly lovable way as well. Their struggles are struggles that we can all relate to though; the film underscores the turmoil around life changes and maturity that we all face at some point, and through those fundamental conflicts, the film reaches an emotional resonance as the characters straddle the threshold of maintaining psychological stability.This film is crafted with top-notch animation quality. It's a bright and colorful film with plenty of imaginative designs. Lighting, textures, and rendering are all great. Movements are very lively and smooth. In some areas, it is genuinely impressive as to how big in scale some of the settings and locales are. Voice-acting is great from the whole cast, the writing is good, and the music score is appropriate.Inside Out is cute, funny, and pretty clever, much like the other films Pixar is best known for. It deserves a look.4/5 (Experience: Good | Content: Good | Film: Good)","

Rileys Dad tust thinks of Sports and is not listening to his wife and her mom is annoyed of him and thinks of her dream man. Really? This is so hostile to men and woman.
So i dont unterstand al these people talking stuff like: Yes this is such a psychologically valuable film. No its not!And the Story is like every other Barbie movie.
A girl is sad cause she's movig away with her parents, she's having a mental breakdown and wants to flee, but then at the end she has friends and everything is alright.So if u want to watch this Movie just to see something from Pixar then do it!
But if u want to see something psychologically valuable then watch Ladybird ore something but not this!","

"INSIDE OUT","Quinoa1984","9 April 2020","Inside Out is one of the most daring films for children - and for adults as well - that I can think of from Hollywood, in the sense that it tells the audience ""look, not only can you be sad sometimes, you NEED to be sad"". That may be the ultimate takeaway, but it permeates a lot of the conflict of the film; there's no real key 'villain' here, and like Pixar's previous film, Monsters University, there's no really clear antagonist ala the robot in WALL-E or Jason Lee in the Incredibles. The stakes are all about 'what is this person going to choose to do, to be, to have the growth and change of human experience?' And with kids too, it's a fascinating idea to explore in the depth this does. Many times as children, we're told to not be so sad, to pick up our spirits and be happy, or be happier, to not cry, to not be angry, and some children even get punished if they, say, cry too much or throw temper tantrums - if they're not ""normal"" in the sense of having constant joy. Look at Winnie the Pooh to see the many different takes on outlooks, such as Tigger being boundless energy, Pooh being curiosity, Piglet fear, Rabbit the 'brains', with Eeyore being the one who is constantly sad, and almost made to seem like kind of a punch-line, the ""Nobody's here but me"" deal.If that sounds a little deep to take your four year old too, don't worry: this is one of the company's most entertaining and, often, funny films. It builds exponentially on the segment from Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, where we saw inside the mind of a man while on a date/during sex. Of course this is a PG kid's movie so it can't go there (It's an 11 year old-girl after all), but the filmmakers give us five 'emotions' with Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear, who all control little Riley as she goes about her life. When her family moves to San Francisco, and a mishap occurs in the control room - Joy and Sadness get taken away and, in maybe the one real Pixar trope (Toy Stories and Nemo come to mind), they got to get back to where they need to be.Growing up and experiencing new things is what Inside Out is about, and getting there is the ultimate conflict. And while it appeals to kids who may be going through this (or will), and for adults who can tap into what Riley goes through, it doesn't stop for jokes involving the different places inside the consciousness sphere: sub-consciousness, 'Dream-Land' (the movie studio, with the dream filter over the camera lens for filming), Imagination-Land, and (my personal favorite) Abstract Thought, where beings turn step by step into shapes and colors.This latter one shows off just how endlessly clever Pixar can be, by making doodles and figures one might see in a painting right before us. And even the Emotion characters themselves keep making the studio work wonders: look at how the hair and fibers on these things comes off and has the depth of detail one always look for in the films from these guys. By now the company could be resting on their laurels solely - and there are some more (unnecessary?) sequels to come. But Inside Out poses another challenge for them, to make all of these different 'lands' and environments, the max of the Memory Balls, the ""Train of Thought"", everything that shows everything was given consideration and metric-tons of creative wit.There's many laughs to be had following along with Joy and Sadness as they try to find their way back, and this is balanced out by the very real, painful things that a child goes through, especially at the age of 11. It's difficult to make an authentic movie in live-action, but in animation it just comes off like a miracle of some kind; all of the peril means something, and a seemingly goofy side character, like Bing-Bong the imaginary friend to Riley, is fully realized as anyone else in the film. Watch when Riley's objects in Imagination Island fall away, and Bing-Bong doesn't know what to do with himself, as Sadness comes up and makes him go forward. Joy doesn't realize why this should be - why can't she cheer him up? It may or may not be obvious, which is what makes the storytelling so precise and tender and spot-on.Some clichés are dealt with - have a dream with your underpants on and falling teeth, of course - and I wouldn't want it any other way in this film. Inside Out is rich in everything you want in a movie: comedy, drama, thrills, and, more than once real catharsis. It doesn't kid the kids, or the adults. You need everything inside you to be whole, is what it means to say, and it does it with brio and understanding of the human spirit.","

"INSIDE OUT","siderite","8 June 2020","We know Pixar can do animation. Is the animation in this one good? Yes, it is, I admit it wholeheartedly. The rest is the story, which is boring as hell.We are used to animations from Pixar that are watchable by the entire family, with enough oomph to make children happy and enough subtle smart to make the adults enjoy the movie. This one is a failure not because children won't enjoy colorful impersonations of base emotions, but because for an adult it all goes from boring to insulting.There is an enormous hype calling this an intelligent story that talks about the inner emotions of children and people in general. It does, but with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. I dumbfoundedly watched a confused jumble of 1940 psychology colored psychedelically to please infants and high people and that had only one hint towards sexuality and none about actual conflict.Not only this could have been better in all respects (maybe including animation), but the best parts for me where that they didn't use celebrities for voice actors and the funny credits scenes. The rest was like watching little kid cartoons, you know, the ones that we wouldn't want any child to watch because they look like they're made by psychotic Coca Cola addicts, but they still put them on on every TV post made for kids.The ""deep"" message of the film, that we don't have to always be happy and that sadness has its purpose and that things are not only black and white (or blue and yellow, whatever) cannot save the utter boredom and pointlessness of the rest of the film. Compared to other Pixar films, this is a disgrace.Bottom line: I am afraid the only thing I don't feel about this movie is joy. Plenty of anger, disgust and sadness, though.","

"INSIDE OUT","desie66","2 December 2010","I was expecting a funny lighthearted animated movie, one I have come to expect from Pixar. Unfortunately there was only one funny scene, but it was the scene I already watched in the trailer. Instead I had to endure over an hour of the most depressing movie I have ever brought my daughter to see. It seems as though Pixar tried desperately to make a movie with an adult theme (ie the psychological workings of emotions in the mind, with a plot that is, unfortunately, commonplace in real life ) but with goofy animation that appeals to children.. I wish they stuck to the adult humor that goes over the kid's heads rather than serious issues that goes over the kid's heads.. Sadly in the end, the ""happy"" ending was only mildly happy. Not nearly happy enough to raise me up out of the depression the movie had sank me into.. I left the cinema down, and that's not what I like to spend money on. I asked my daughter, ""so what would you give it out of 10?"" She said ""an 8"" but when she got into the car she seemed sad, I asked her was she OK? and she started to cry and retold me a part of the movie she found sad.. Unfortunately that didn't go over her head.","

"INSIDE OUT","RGzer0","30 March 2011","Well, I did it. I finally watched Inside Out, Pixar's latest masterpiece. After months of waiting for it to be released, and listening to peers rave about how it's Pixar's best film yet, that everybody should see it, and that I will love it, I rented it on iTunes and gave it a watch, despite my reservations.Now, here's something about me that some people might be able to relate to, and some might not. I can always tell whether or not I will like a movie, or TV show, or book, either based on what I hear about it, or even if it's little more than a gut feeling. It's almost like a sixth sense, which I've only recently come to understand. There's an alarm that goes off in my head that warns me, ""You are not going to like this."" When it goes off like an air raid siren, I know to stay away.Like I said, I've only recently come to fully understand this, and there have been many times over the years when I've gone ahead anyway despite my misgivings, and ended up wishing I'd trusted said misgivings. I have never been wrong. When I first saw the promotional posters, and learned the plot outline, the inner alarms were blaring loudly and angrily. My instincts have never failed me before.But, as they say, there is a first time for everything.And when that time comes, I will be sure to make it known, because that time still has yet to come.If I had a dime for every time I heard that this movie is Pixar's ""return to form,"" I would probably be set for life. To that assertion, I have a question. Exactly what *form* would that be? The Pixar *I* grew up with made movies that made me *laugh*, that were exciting, and made me feel warm and fuzzy on the inside. This movie, on the other hand, made me laugh in earnest a grand total of once (""Eat me, I'm organic!""), and kind of chuckle one other time (*snore* ""Who's the birthday girl?""). That's it. The entire rest of the movie, I was wanting desperately to go home, even though I was in my room the whole time.No Pixar movie has ever made me feel so miserably unhappy, and the 30-second-long happy ending did nothing to make up for the preceding hour and a half of oppressive, and progressively intensifying, gloom. My goodness, that was depressing. I'm not P.O.'d that it made me cry; I actually never cried, although I did come pretty close at the very end, but even if I had, it wasn't in a good way. I have no idea how this movie was supposed to make me feel, but I felt downcast whether that was the intent or not.If this is Pixar's ""return to form,"" then I'm not sure I want on this ship anymore. This ""form"" started seven years ago with Wall-E, a dreadfully depressing film, continued with Up, about which I listened to my instincts and mercifully skipped (a decision I have never once regretted), and Toy Story 3, which I saw one time and have never watched it since (three guesses why, and the first two don't count). And now Inside Out. Wall-E was a mercy compared to this, and it has barely had time to fully sink in.I just... I'm dejected. I didn't like it at all. As I said before, I had a very bad feeling from the moment I found out what the movie was about. I put off watching it for almost a week after renting it, just to steel myself for it, even after waiting months for it to come out, and now... I'm not sure anything could have prepared me for this. Frankly, I wish I'd left well enough alone, ignored everybody's raving and pressuring me to see it, and never watched it. I guess one positive is that now nobody can tell me 'don't knock it if you haven't tried it.' I tried it, and it made me miserable. I told you so.I apologize to any readers if I'm coming off as ranting and railing, but... that was upsetting. I think I'm going to listen to some John Williams to try to cheer myself up.P.S. Just so nobody misunderstands me, from a purely objective standpoint, this was a marvelously well done film. The animation is beautiful, the voice-acting top notch, and the musical score is lovely. I am not calling any of that into question. This is merely how I experienced the story, and it made me feel like I was dying inside.","

"INSIDE OUT","fatcat-73450","27 June 2013","But not a fairy tale.The film's style is very much reminiscent of Wreck-It-Ralph which was probably inspired by adventure tales as old as time such as Anabasis or The Odyssey.That is to say, it's not such much a linear three-act structure as a wild journey through imaginative landscapes.It is important to help children learn to deal with their emotions, as Mr. Rogers stated was one of his most important goals in his address to congress to help save public television. In other words, this has been known for a long time but it was never discussed so directly or on such a grand scale as here. One of the most important principles of emotional control is detachment, which can be accomplished by visualizing internal phenomena as separate from oneself. In short, Disney chose an excellent topic to make a children's movie out of.As for the delivery, I'm afraid it's not very memorable. IT sort of meanders through a day in Riley's (the human vehicle the emotions are directing) life with sparse plot. It's not extremely clear why the emotions need to go on their grand adventure or the reason is so convoluted that it's lost on adult viewers, let alone children.The moral message is, sadly, not very aptly handled, either. All of the emotions other than joy seem to be incompetent fools, which means their very great importance to a person's life is only light implied or touched upon. The ultimate role of sadness - to elicit pity from others - was especially disappointing since it puts dependence on external support structures over self-acceptance.Disney is also moving the way of less prestigious animation houses and trying to appeal to every demographic by having distinct but separate strains of appeal - for example, there are adult jokes that will fly over children's heads and there's crazy frantic nonsensical action that will probably bore adults but entertain children. It's crass and lazy.Honourable Mentions: Alice in Wonderland (1951). One cannot help but compare Inside Out unfavourably to Disney's irrational adventure masterpiece. Alice goes through a parade of crazy scenes and characters that are very memorable to both old and young. The film has universal meaning as well that's mixed masterfully together without the need for frantic colourful scenes to appeal solely to children and crass relationship jokes to appeal only to adults.As a child, one cannot help but commiserate with Alice's frustration and find the crazy characters and their idiosyncracies entertaining. As an adult, this aspect is interesting, no doubt, but one also sees in these very same scenes a certain disheartening melancholia about what Wonderland's denizens reflect - the fantasy creatures are all obsessed with their ridiculous and inane personal ambitions and show cruel disregard for Alice's concerns or suffering - a very adroit parody of our actual society.","

"INSIDE OUT","Terryfan","13 July 2020","Tonight I took my niece to go see Inside Out because she asked me to and being the good uncle I took her.Turns out that the movie is actually pretty creative and has a original plot that is not too often these days. This is the 5th film I saw in theaters this year and turns out to be worth your while.I am not giving anything away because this is a movie you have to watch to better understand it because it does so much to be original and it does well for it.First let's talk about the cast Riley (Voiced Kaitlyn Dias) with the voices in her head: Joy (Voiced by Amy Poehler), Sadness (Voiced by Phyllis Smith), Fear (Voiced by Bill Hader), Anger (Voiced by Lewis Black), Disgust (Voiced by Mindy Kaling) along with her parents Mom (Diane Lane) Dad (Kyle MacLachlan) along with Bing Bong (Richard Kind). Pixar once again showcases their talents for bringing animation to life and it really shows it in this film. The movie is just amazing to look at and the emotion characters are very well design, you can see the real effects of the animation as it present itself on screenThe voice acting is really strong in this one as you can tell in the voice work that everyone wanted to bring the film to the dance Amy's performance is one of the best examples of brilliant voice acting and Kaitlyn's talented work as well is good. They all show real interest in making this movie when you listen to their voice work you can respect the energy of their performance'sInside Out has such a original story that only is best described to seeing the movie on the big screen because the story is clever and you will get good character development throughout the film with a lot of thinking that goes along with this movie.It really gets into your emotions, with a few tearful moments what comes out of this movieTrust me you should take the family to see Inside Out it is worth your timeWith great animation, impressive voice work and a character driven story there is nothing that holds PIXAR back it is one of their best works of animation that ranks out there with Toy Story, Cars among othersI give Inside Out an 8 out of 10","

"INSIDE OUT","Heinzwill","5 November 2021","It's been nearly a year since I first saw this film. I would say I had pretty low knowledge in films before I first saw Inside Out (not to say that I'm highly intelligent on films now). I only saw about 200 films prior. I hadn't seen a lot of classic films or even know that film can be an art form just through its camera work among other aspects. So you could say that I can't speak for everyone on my views of this film. And you may be right because opinions are subjective anyway.This is my favourite film ever.Like I said above, I didn't see a lot of films that were deemed as masterpieces at that time. While I still have a lot more to see, I can say that I have caught up with many notable ones now. I've seen The Godfather. I've seen 2001: A Space Odyssey. I've seen Casablanca. I've seen The Shawshank Redemption. I've seen Pulp Fiction. I've seen Lawrence of Arabia.Yet this is still my favourite film of all-time.80 years from now, this won't change. I felt something extraordinary that will never be felt again. This to me, was a revelation. In honest words I've never experienced something like this before. Only because of Inside Out I was able to kick myself off of a serious depression I had for years, understand the meaning of feeling, feel sympathy to why people act the way they do, be interested in films. In fact, I went and watched the films I mentioned above because of Inside Out.Ever since that late July of 2015 I had been compulsively obsessed with Inside Out to the point where I checked its Oscar chances, IMDb rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating and box office grosses to the point where I felt like I had to stop myself from doing as when seeing anything negative about it just makes feel let down and quite sad about it. It's still something that I'm trying to quit but obviously it's not going that well (ie. this review after one year of the film's release).Inside Out taught me more about depression, empathy, importance of sorrow and interpersonal relationships than any books, talk shows, real-life stories or cat posters could ever dream of. It made me want to become a filmmaker because if this much craft and intelligence can be put in a film, then sign me up to the industry because I want to be a part of it. I don't want to talk about the story or the technical aspects of Inside Out because everyone has talked about it already.In the course of less than ten months, I've see this film six times. That's more than any other film during the same period. It's a true testament to its strength and impact on me that's hardly ever going to fade away. I know this isn't the case for everybody. I keep trying to find anybody else who had the same experience as I did walking out of this film for the first time. I yielded only little results and although it brings me down a little since I don't really have anyone else to relate to, I keep telling myself, that no matter what happens to Inside Out in the future, whether its Rotten Tomatoes score or IMDb rating or its overall stature among the general public, whether it gets worse or better for it, this will always be favourite film of all-time. Nothing will change that and I have to let go of everybody else's opinion whether or not they had similar emotional experiences towards it.You can vote ""not helpful"" on this review all you want (which seems to be a recurring case for all positive user reviews here.... I wonder why...) but it's not going to matter anyway. This is a beautiful film that will resonate in me always.I will never forget Inside Out.","

The over-rate-o-meter is broken and that must be why no one can tell how overrated it is.Having heard some oozing reviews on the radio and online, with statements like ""return to form for Pixar"" and ""leaving the disappointment of Brave behind"", I was expecting something spectacular. All I can say is... wow.Brave is several factors of infinity better than this film. Brave has a plot, it has some comedy, it has nice songs and music - it has some characters and the characters have some fire.In contrast Inside Out relies on one thing and one thing only - anecdotes. Everything hinges on a cheap emotional connection to the various events in life that everyone experiences. The ""actual"" film itself has a weak, scattered and infuriating plot-line pasted together from random sketches. Sadness and Joy are both equally annoying - and theyare the main characters! The characters are all one-dimensional and there are very few of them. There is no memorable music, there are no memorable quotes, the comedy - well there really isn't any to speak of. The only ray of light in the whole thing is the buildup and end to ""put the foot down"" and it isn't mind blowing, it's just a chuckle.Now, is Frozen overrated? Yes, of course it is, but again at LEAST is has a powerful main song and some interesting characters to merit it's following.Despite all of the ""glowing"" reviews and comments here on IMDb and elsewhere, I defy anyone to come up with a single quote, a single piece of music, a single character from this film that merits the enthusiasm.3/10 - and that is being generous","

"INSIDE OUT","adj-jarvis","19 September 2013","I'll start by saying I enjoy majority of Pixar films. In fact, I love them! However, unfortunately I do not think that this film lived up to Pixar's name. Initially, I thought the general idea for the film was fantastic and very fresh. A great idea doesn't always make a great film though. To start with, the film was interesting to see how they incorporated the Inside characters and to see how they would interact with one another etc. But as soon as the story kicked in, the film started to become quite dull and boring. There are orbs that contain memories that are transferred to the 'Inside' headquarters and some get stored in a special place where the memory will last forever. Anyway, two of the Inside characters, Joy and Sadness are sucked up in to this tube and sent out of headquarters and so the film is focused on those two characters. This was annoying because I felt they were the two most unlikable characters in the film. Sadness was just irritating and Joy was cringey and also quite irritating. They are soon joined by an imaginary friend character created by the girl whose head they are inside and he brings it to life a little more as he is more of a likable character. However the film soon dries up again.The best part in the film was *BIG SPOILER* when the imaginary friend sacrifices himself and dies and I say the best part because its one of the only parts in the film that actually made me 'feel'. The rest I didn't care much for. Ironic as the film is all about emotions and such. To sum up, this film was very boring and they could of possibly explored more with the general idea.9/10 for originality, 4/10 for entertainment value.","

"INSIDE OUT","guskeller","17 January 2011","Equally educational and entertaining, Inside Out evokes deep feelings while examining the importance of those feelings. Centered around emotional personifications in a young girl's head, the film follows her adjustment to moving across the country. Joy is the lead protagonist, but she learns plenty about the value of Sadness. Meanwhile, Inside Out depicts abstract concepts like memories, imagination, and the subconscious as literal objects and locations. This is both uniquely fun and substantially informative. Also, the voice acting clearly portrays each emotional state. Undoubtedly, Inside Out will captivate with its plot and linger with its messages.On a technical level, Inside Out is proficient. The Pixar animation is premium, with vivid textures and detail. The production design is also a highlight because its literal representations of the mental world are distinctively whimsical yet instructive. The cinematography isn't overtly stylish but conveys meaning through POVs, lighting, and colors. Furthermore, sound has dramatic silence at climactic moments, editing cleanly weaves between internal and external realities, and the soundtrack reflects the delicately bittersweet mood. Plus, the direction smoothly redefines difficult emotions with a positive tone. Overall, Inside Out is an artful presentation and an enlightening experience.Writing: 10/10

"INSIDE OUT","luke-a-mcgowan","11 March 2023","I currently have a top-rated comment on Youtube that bugs me every few days as new people like it. I was giving someone flack about calling Inside Out the best Pixar film since Toy Story 3, because that doesn't say anything. So its better than Cars 2 (universally held to be the worst), Brave (the most forgettable) and Monsters University (a prequel that didn't exactly evoke any wonder). Inside Out is a magical film experience and it deserves higher praise than that. The unreachable pinnacle on which Finding Nemo and The Lion King sit now seems so much more attainable.The voice cast of this film is utterly delightful - Amy Poehler is beyond perfect as the perpetually optimistic Joy. Her voice has been making me smile for years and now it does so in a whole new way. The rest of the cast - from Lewis Black's Anger to Phyllis Smith's Sadness - matches perfectly with their character's design and body language. It doesn't even feel like voice acting, I believed that these were actual creatures who had thoughts and were speaking to each other. The film's screenplay is an utter delight and I would have to say for the first time I will be outraged if it is not a front-runner for Best Original Screenplay. The beautiful crafting of the emotions and their dialogue to the clever (and utterly believable) bureaucracy that makes up the emotions centre. Sprinklings of meta-humour (the unicorn standing in for a famous actress), nostalgia (the imaginery friend), one-liners (there's deja vu! and blah blah! and deja vu!"") and more adult themes (Riley's return home at the end of the film) show perfect levels of balance and utterly sensational writing quality.There's not to much more I can say without just listing a bunch of scenes I enjoyed, so I'll keep this one short and say that Inside Out is magical. Its one of the best Pixar films of all time, and its great to see they can still make me ask ""what if?""","

"INSIDE OUT","MrDHWong","29 December 2010","Inside Out is the latest animated feature film by Disney Pixar. After their previous three movies (Cars 2, Brave and Monsters University) failed to impress me, naturally my expectations were quite low. However, this worked to my advantage because I can say that this is one of the best films they have ever made. It represents a strong return to form from the legendary animation studio.Riley Anderson is a young girl who lives a happy life with her loving parents and friends in Minnesota. Guiding her through life are Riley's personified emotions; Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger. However, at the age of eleven, Riley and her parents relocate to San Francisco after her father finds a new job there. This change in location and atmosphere comes as a shock to young Riley and her emotions desperately try to help her cope with living in a new city, going to a new school and trying to make new friends, with sometimes disastrous results.This is one of the most clever, poignant, touching and original films that Pixar have made to date. I loved the concept of how the emotions in our heads know what is best for us and are trying to navigate us through life. Also, its moving story about acceptance and change will strike a chord with anyone who has moved someplace different and have tried to fit in and adjust to a new life. I would even rank it alongside Up and the Toy Story films in terms of how emotional it can get. My only real issue is that some of the film's themes may be too complex for really young viewers but I guess as long as their parents are with them to explain some of the more difficult to understand concepts then there shouldn't be a problem.I rate it a solid 9/10.","

"INSIDE OUT","Hellmant","6 February 2011","'INSIDE OUT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Pixar and Disney's new computer-animated fantasy film, about a young girl that's guided through the struggles of moving, and the frequent absence of her father, by her emotions; which are personified, with individual personalities of their own. The movie was directed by Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen and it was written by Docter, Carmen, Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley (Docter has co-written and directed other popular Pixar flicks, like 'UP' and 'MONSERS, INC.'; as well as co- wrote 'WALL-E' and 'TOY STORY' 1 & 2). It features the voice talents of Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Richard Kind, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Mindy Kaling, Kaitlyn Dias, Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan. The concept for the film has been done many times before (most notably on the 90's TV sitcom 'HERMAN'S HEAD') but it's still a very imaginative and well made kids' film!Riley (Dias) is a young girl, growing up in Minnesota, who has five voices inside her mind; guiding her every decision, and feeling. They're Joy (Poehler), Sadness (Smith), Fear (Hader), Anger (Black) and Disgust (Kaling). Joy is in charge of keeping Riley primarily happy, but she's constantly struggling with how to deal with Sadness. When Riley is forced to move to San Francisco, at age 11, and her father (MacLachlan) is constantly away at work, things become really challenging for Joy. Especially when Joy and Sadness are thrown out of the headquarters, inside Riley's mind, and have to make a journey back to it, in order to restore Riley's mental stability.I grew up on 'HERMAN'S HEAD'; I used to watch it all the time when I was a kid, so when I first saw the trailer for this film, I wasn't very impressed. It seemed like a rip-off and it also just didn't look that good to me. So I had low expectation for the movie, until I heard all the rave reviews for it, from critics and audiences alike. After seeing the film, I can say it's not a blatant rip-off; and it does have plenty of fresh ideas and creativity of it's own. Although the premise isn't original, it does deal with it in a interesting and entertaining way; the whole world, inside Riley's mind (the film creates), is very fascinating. I do wonder though, if we all have people inside our heads, guiding us through life, do they all have people inside their heads too, guiding them, and so on? The humor is kind of childish but it does have a very positive message; about dealing with depression, and life struggles, that I think could be beneficial for every kid to see. It might not be one of the most original Pixar films, but it is one of it's best (in my opinion).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/3LSix0bykDQ","

"INSIDE OUT","liquidb_84","18 September 2012","I will say that this movie did make me laugh out loud quite a few times. There is some great observational humor that captures the eccentricities of the human mind (or cats as can be seen in the credits), but overall I found the movie to be pretty boring and depressing.To start with there is basically no story or development of any of the characters. Riley moves to a new town, and the five emotions in her head have to figure out how to find balance/happiness after the move. The problem is that the whole movie is based around 5 characters (Joy, Disgust, Anger, Sadness, and Fear) all of whom are stagnant and kind of annoying.Most of the story takes place in the ""control room"" of Riley's brain, and it appears that the animators were extremely lazy or uncreative when deciding what the room should look like. It is basically an empty purple bubble with a computer in the middle, considering this room is the scene for about half the movie I'm surprised they didn't try to make it a little more exciting.On top of this the movie is very depressing, and not in a ""good cry"" kind of way, but in a ""growing up sucks, you are going to be unhappy for the rest of your life"" kind of way. Despite the fact that Joy is the leader of Riley's emotional control team, we constantly see sadness (who should have been called depression) constantly pull Riley down into the pits of useless, apathetic despair. On top of this we see that the leaders of Mom and Dad's emotional control teams are Sadness and Anger respectively; oh the joys of being an adult.Over the course of the movie Riley's memories go from those of mostly childlike happiness, to the bittersweet jaded memories of an adult. It seems that adults in the world Pixar created can no longer feel pure joy, their emotions are always tinged with a hint of anger, sadness, or disgust. Maybe this is true for a lot of people, but I think kids should enjoy their blissful naive ignorance for as long as possible. I would not bring your kids to this movie unless you feel the need to forewarn them of the depressing future they have to look forward to.","

"INSIDE OUT","tavm","30 September 2019","Before this feature and the short that preceded it-Lava-director Pete Doctor appeared and explained how his movie-like many others-can take you to new places and inspire various emotions. He was certainly right about that! This film-which centered on the emotions of a girl who feels alienated moving to a new place after years of being comfortable in the old one-can be funny and sad in all the right places. Especially when it focuses on the characters of Joy and Sadness and also an imaginary friend, this movie hits all the right buttons. Very young children may not completely understand all that's depicted but they should still be pretty entertained by many of the images and characterizations depicted here in computer animated form. I really don't want to reveal much so on that note, I highly recommend Inside Out.","

The direction and screenplay are both incredible. Both the casting and acting are incredible also. No one actor took the show this was truly an ensemble performance by all the actors who played the emotions perfectly. The actors that were chosen for each emotion did it perfectly Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Bill Hader as Fear, Lewis Black as anger and lastly Mindy Kaling as disgust. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.","

"INSIDE OUT","Mark_Speaking_Truthfully","16 June 2020","Pixar has a new target audience -- the pseudo-intellectual movie critic who happens to be a horrible parent with a complete lack of awareness as to why their children behave as they do during times of stress.Yes, quite possibly my worst movie experience ever... And I am not a young opinionated teen, but rather a middle-aged parent with seasoned movie tastes -- or at least I like to think so.Not a single child in the packed theater left happier than when they entered. Very few happy moments throughout a constantly darkening film, with about 45 seconds of ""happy"" resolution at the end. The dialogue is perplexing to children and possibly many adults in the audience. A stunning failure.All in all, probably a poor decision by me as a parent to view (or by Pixar to develop?) a film with so few moments of joy or happiness for children, who I had incorrectly assumed were the target audience. But how was I to know??Do yourself a favor and find a real children's movie for your little ones and not this rubbish. Or, just leave after the impressive 'Lava' short.","

"INSIDE OUT","rebeccadew-85920","19 November 2020","Call me late to the draw, but this two-year-old film Inside Out has me more upset than its preteen protagonist, Riley.Why was Riley upset? Why am I upset?All of Riley's emotions are purely reactive. They are simply responses to external stimuli, not the least of which are the emotions of her parents. This misplaced emphasis on externals is surprising, given the professed aim of the film: to look at human experience from the inside out.""There's absolutely no reason for Riley to be happy right now,"" states one emotion mater-of-factly to another.Every experience may be an opportunity for either joy or sadness. But the film makes it look as if we are controlled by emotions, and it is circumstances which control us through our emotional responses to them.Problem with the film: the film conflates joy with happiness and joy with love. These are not the same thing.Another problem with the film: even memories are cast as amenable to reordering, disposal and forgottenness.Our core memories shape our realities, which are presented as simply a reflection of our perceptions accumulated and understood over time. Our personalities are shaped by memories which influence our response to what we perceive as or experiences day-to-day. When Joy and Sadness go missing, everything goes haywire. Personality ""Islands"" are depicted as unstable; they shake and fall and crash to the ground. Imaginary friends like the elephant-teddy-bear Bing Bong are depicted as ridiculous and incredible.Abstract thought is depicted as imaginary (!!). (So much for the history of human experience, culture and civilization . . .)Ultimately, experiences are depicted as meaningless as soon as they are forgotten.**SPOILER ALERT** Riley, through no fault of her own, is driven to react with anger and run away from home.The entirety of her personality is depicted as responsive and reactive—responsive to the emotions with which she is presented and reactive to the circumstances which she encounters. The idea is that giving Joy an inordinate place is unreality. All emotions are important and therefore to be valued and given an airing.In the end, Sadness DOES have a purpose. She helps Riley (and us) process life.There IS a moral to the story. Rather than trying to ""fix"" emotions, we should accept them and process them as they present themselves to us. (Perhaps this is why the tireless Joy is presented as a bit of an egocentric.)But if all emotions are equally valuable, why give priority to Joy? And if Joy is not given priority, we are opening ourselves up to a very Sad, Fearful, Angry and Disgusted alternate universe.Perhaps that encapsulates my feelings on the matter. Angry and Disgusted.When the plot resolves, **SPOILER ALERT** it is only by coming to terms with the grief over her childhood hockey disappointments and her imaginary friend Bing Bong's sacrifice through Sadness that Riley's redemption and Joy's return to the Control Center of the brain are made possible. Sadness has a part to play, after all. I do admit that it's okay to feel. I do think that childhood memories play an important part in the formation of personality. And I do value the role of Sadness in the processing of these and other emotions. But I feel less Joy than Anger, less Sadness than Disgust as this film draws to a close. The assumption of the movie that troubles me the most is that emotions are presented as the primary processors of reality. Emotions are all there is. Imagination is nonsensical and problematic. There is no soul beyond the emotions—no reason to speak of. I do appreciate the film for its playfulness, creativity and colour. As a spectacle, it is appealing though not spectacular. And I do like the repetitive running joke about TripleDent gum . . .But this is not a children's movie, not the adventure reel of delightful music and happy endings we have come to know and love. Only Sadness can bring Riley back to feeling. And therein lies a major flaw in the central message of the film—it is on the centrality of circumstance, not emotions, that our final focus is placed. The film ends convincing us less of the validity of emotions than of the pressures of circumstance. Joy does not win; Sadness does. In this sense the film is not a comedy.Nor is it an accurate representation of reality, inside or out.","

"INSIDE OUT","sandnair87","2 April 2011","It's old hat to call a movie an ""emotional thrill ride,"" but in Inside Out, it's literally true, as the abstract concepts of our minds prove to be the perfect playground for the Pixar pixelators.The opening scenes of Inside Out skillfully introduce the characters while generating a sense of joy at the wonders of the world, as a little girl named Riley is born in Minnesota and starts to grow. But unlike other animated movies, Riley is not the hero of the film. The principal characters are the primary emotions in her head: permanently buoyant, yellow-hued emoticon-Tinkerbell hybrid – Joy; fiery red, pugnacious, his fuse as short as his sleeves – Anger; bespectacled blue blob beneath owlish spectacles – Sadness; chic, fastidious and disdainful green - Disgust and a bow-tie wearing purplish bag-of-nerves with startled eyebrows that levitate above his head - Fear. Together they guide Riley's feelings from a knob-laden control desk, processing her new memories as they arrive at the Head-quarters, each memory looking like a glowing bowling ball and colored according to mood. Some of her experiences become important, influential long-term memories and are stored as color-coded orbs; others are dumped into the vast wasteland of forgotten experiences.In the idyll of childhood, it's the ever ebullient Joy, naturally, who takes the lead at the console. But childhood bliss cannot last forever. Riley is uprooted from Minnesota to San Francisco when her father takes another job and the turmoil of the move to a new home leaves Riley coping with everything from living in a less-than-desirable neighborhood to missing her friends to feeling like an outcast at her new school. Things are getting complicated inside Riley Central! This soon triggers a crisis as a control-room malfunction leaves Joy and Sadness stranded in a vast allegorical geography of Riley's mind-scape. And so begins an odyssey through her psyche, as they traverse such wonderfully rendered obstacles as a library of memory banks and an imaginary friend - unbearably tragi-cute Bing Bong. Can Joy and Sadness make it back to headquarters in time, before a dejected Riley runs away from home?Emotions run wildly funny in this exceedingly original story. But what's most brilliant about the Inside Out is how director Pete Docter not only connects beautifully to those emotions but turns them into his characters. The story takes us outside Riley's mind and into the real world just often enough for us to appreciate what she's going through. It's all done with a deft touch. Working with a multi-layered story and a sparkling voice-cast, Inside Out comes with a surprising amount of depth, resulting in a film that is not only delightfully entertaining, but also thought-provoking and very much emotionally-complex.Pixar has always been great at coaxing our eyeballs out of our fat heads with awe-inspiring visuals and vibrant colors, but Inside Out is undoubtedly the studio's most impressive piece of eye-candy yet. They outdo themselves with vast, intricate, amazingly detailed landscapes ranging from the ""movie studio"" where Riley's dreams are produced every night to the places where Riley's subconscious and abstract thinking reside, all brimming with sparkling visuals. The running gags are all delicious (don't miss the end credits) and keep flying in thick and fast.Fittingly for a movie set inside someone's head, Pixar's latest is a fireworks display of fizzing ideas and bursts of imagination. Poignant, heartfelt, and endearing, Pixar's latest outing challenges us all to dream, to feel, to be!","

"INSIDE OUT","RemusGrey","2 April 2014","Inside Out is kind of like a coming-of-age story, but told from a very different perspective. It starts by introducing us to the emotions inside the head of Riley, a little girl from Minnesota. Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear run things in headquarters, taking turns at the controls of Riley. Joy mostly gets to run things, though, Riley amassing a huge collection of happy memories. But things are thrown into turmoil when Riley's family moves to San Francisco. Things go awry at headquarters, which results in Joy, Sadness and Riley's most important core memories being thrown out.The film then cuts between Joy trying to make her way back to headquarters and the three remaining emotions trying to run things in her absence. This story takes some very abstract concepts and turns them into a grand adventure. It turns a little girl's psyche into a colorful landscape populated with figments of imagination and a working class devoted to keeping things together. The film is exactly what Pixar is all about, delivering a brightly-lit narrative that is unafraid to get melancholy. It is a story about embracing all our feelings, even the ones that don't feel too good.The nuts and bolts of the plot take a very familiar form, with a pair of mismatched characters racing against time to get to somewhere important. This is basically the setup of eighty percent of all children's films. But Inside Out takes this basic framework to stranger places. This is a story that mostly works within the realm of metaphor, the locations representative of the inner workings of the mind. The film creates landscapes that stand in for the complex mechanics of personality and memory, finding interesting ways to represent an emotional journey.And so the characters are ride a train of thought and go to where dreams are produced. And the emotions assert themselves at different intervals, and we see the effect in Riley in the real world. It's really clever stuff. The things happening outside drive the action inside, but the movie makes it appear that it's the other way around. The journey within is purely representational, the anthropomorphized emotions a really ingenious means of showing the growth of this one person. All of it is done beautifully, with lively visuals and a willingness to explore tragedy within the context of a children's cartoon.There's a wealth of imagination in these images. There would have to be, given the subject matter. But the world inside Riley's head is a joy to behold. And when we get glimpses into the heads of other people, the differing design sensibilities do a lot to enrich the milieu of this particular world. The voice acting is top notch, with Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith bringing a lot of personality into roles that are specifically written to be representative of a single emotion. Lewis Black, Bill Hader and Mindy Kaling are also delightful in much simpler, more outwardly comedic roles.Inside Out is exactly what Pixar is all about. For years now, the company has been telling children's stories that are much more willing to get emotionally complex. This film features the same kind of thinking that allowed for the depiction of tragedy in the first ten minutes of Up, and the quiet acceptance of fate in Toy Story 3. This is a film that is about that specifically, about the capacity of young people to take the bad with the good, the capacity to understand that there is more to sadness than just being sad. It's a simple, yet beautiful truth that doesn't get explored nearly enough.10/10Oh, and tell this lesson being taught to your kids: You can't have the same emotion for the rest of your life. Too much of everything can lead to something terrible, and too much joy, sadness, anger, disgust, and fear is bad too. If you are having a problem, you can talk to your parents about it. You have to open up to them so that they can solve your problems.","

I saw a warning about Graphic Violence on ""Spy"" and decided it would be suitable, but having seen the trailer for ""Inside Out"" and being a huge Disney fan, I decided to go see it.The movie was so hard on me, my Service Dog spent half the movie trying to pull me out of the theatre. She does that when she feels that my PTSD has been triggered.I have discussed the movie with several other Service Dog handlers, and they have thanked me for the warning, as well as with friends I know suffer from depression, or have family members who do.They MUST put a warning on this movie that it may trigger emotional response in patients with Depression. I am thankful for my Service Dog and support network, because I came out of the movie an emotional disaster.

"INSIDE OUT","bob-the-movie-man","30 March 2018","Pixar excel in making multi-layered films that can be enjoyed by kids and adults in equal measure. They have also developed a truly astonishing ability to tap into a parent's deepest emotions, such that while their kids were quietly enjoying the first few minutes of ""Up""; Jessie's song from ""Toy Story 2"" or Andy leaving for college in ""Toy Story 3"", their parents were sobbing hopelessly into their sleeves. Inside Out, the new Pixar animation, is a very subtle case in point. And it's also far too clever to be wasted on kids.Inside Out chronicles the middle-class trauma of 11-year old Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) who has to leave the bucolic charms of Minnesota (did she never see ""Fargo""?) to be dragged to the uncultured wasteland of San Francisco, and forced to cope with the 'horrors' of a new house, a new school, yada, yada. So far, so yawn. Except that we experience all of this through the emotions in Riley's head brought vividly to life by Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear. Sitting – Star Trek Enterprise style – at a console somewhere behind Riley's forehead, they watch what's going on and control her emotions to suit. When things go badly awry, Joy and Sadness are pitched out of the control room and dumped into the depths of Riley's long term memory (an area bearing a shockingly multi-coloured resemblance to the Hall of Prophecies in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix""). With no joy or sadness in her life, how can Riley cope? There follows a desperate mission to return Joy and Sadness to the HQ, aided and abetted by Riley's long-lost imaginary friend Bing Bong, before her life is permanently wrecked by bad decisions.Let's start with the positives on this film. Inside Out is enormously inventive. If the Indiana Jones series drove an interest in kids doing degrees in Archaeology, then the same could happen for Psychology as a result of this movie. At the very least, you can see how kids with issues of anger management or depression could really get genuine value out of this simple movie by visualising and therefore understanding their problems better. The sociological impacts of the movie might actually be quite profound.All the leading actors lend their voices to very believable characters, with Diane Lane (Martha Kent from ""Man of Steel"") and Twin Peak's own Kyle MacLachlan also being very effective in voicing Riley's Mom and Dad respectively. The animation team do a splendid job in rendering both the wild excesses of Riley's brain and the seedier foggy streets of San Francisco. Michael Giacchino again comes up trumps with a moving and highly effective score.And that trailer. Boy, that trailer! If I ever wanted to see a film more this year after viewing a trailer, it was this one. Brilliantly zipping from Riley's brain to the Mom's brain to the Dad's brain and back again, and making ""Brazilian helicopter pilot"" a defining synonym for day-dreaming and lustful women.Unfortunately, and slightly disappointingly for me, this sequence was also the best bit of the film. We spend 90% of the rest of the film inside Riley's head. And whilst there are wildly inventive moments in that world – for example, while she sleeps, the day's memories are being dispatched to long term memory, and the Hollywood style movie studio kicks into dream productions – some of this running time is borderline dull. Whilst kids will no doubt remain mesmerised by the antics, the comic potential of the interplay between the emotions in different people's brains is barely tapped again. (Almost in recognition of this lapse, we get treated to a very amusing mid-credits sequence zipping in and out of human and animal brains). If there is a sequel to the film (and it's notable that the console ""puberty"" button was never hit), then with any luck John Lasseter will instruct his team to provide more of this type of content: there is comedy gold to be mined there.On possibly a purely personal note I was also rather distracted by the animation of the hair of Joy and Sadness: perhaps it worked better in 3D than 2D, but it looked to be a bad photoshop paste effect to me.As I mentioned up front, the film is subtly moving. An important lesson it teaches ('teaches' like being hammered round the head with a candy-covered truncheon) is that it's ""OK to be sad sometimes"". Do you remember the time around age 11 or 12 where you grew up just enough that Christmas Day didn't seem QUITE as thrilling and exciting as it did when you were 6? And didn't that cause those joyful present-opening ""core memories"" to be tinged ever so slightly with a haze of nostalgic sadness? This film amplifies those feelings through a prism of faint regret, and older viewers should be prepared to shed a tear or too over the lost joys of years gone by. The genetic code of ""Up"" was clearly preserved in amber and emerging at random. You have been warned.So in summary, ""Inside Out"" is a great film and well deserving of your cinema dollar, but perhaps a smidgen disappointing in its execution when set against the overall marketing hype, and particularly the bar set by that glorious trailer. It will still make a fortune for Disney and Pixar though, and good luck to them.Finally, the Pixar short – Lava - tells the musical story of an old Pacific volcano seeking the love of his life, and is an animated delight that had me grinning from ear to ear. I just lava-d it! Do NOT arrive late. Do NOT miss this.(See the graphical version of this review at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address there to receive my future reviews. Thanks).","

"INSIDE OUT","kunalkhandwala","4 August 2021","As a studio whose films established benchmarks in animation technology, Pixar has also set a precedent in refreshed storytelling with some deeply emotional and philosophical undertones. In its most audacious attempt at that and in the extraordinary league of 'Up' and 'Wall-E', Pixar now gets behind the scenes of adolescence in the most imaginative way possible with Inside Out. Directors Peter Docter ('Up', 'Monsters, Inc') and Ronnie Del Carmen create a wonderfully animated world of the complex human mind with stunning details of notions such as islands of personality, dream studios, imagination land and the headquarters. Riley is 11 years old and so far, Joy has successfully managed to be her dominant emotion. Until she moves to San Francisco with her parents.Born in Minnesota, Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) excels at ice hockey, has a close friend and is loved by her equally goofy parents. These aspects of her life form her personality and special memories leave a lasting impression in her mind. Her father's business prospects move them to San Francisco and that's when their dreams of being in the beautiful city by the bay slowly start to crumble with a typical house that is on the verge of ruin. Riley must also struggle at school as a newbie without friends while coping with anxious parents who are already troubled with financial woes. While all of this happens on the Outside, the emotions in her head are actually animated characters who have the job of maintaining sanctity in Riley's personality. Joy (Amy Poehler) is vibrant, positive and just... happy. Sadness (Phyllis Smith) has her depressing way of seeing things and is somehow inspired to touch all of Riley's memories. Fear (Bill Hader) is obsessively cautious about Riley's each move, thus keeping her safe while Disgust (Mindy Kaling) brings out the sass and disapproval of things and people for Riley. Then there's the newspaper reading, head scorching, easily agitated emotion of Anger (Lewis Black) that basically entertains the viewers. Through their combined efforts, memory, in the form of orbs roll into the headquarters with most of them being the color of Joy. The special memories outside, become core memories inside that are safeguarded meticulously. Her personality traits outside form islands of personality inside which look more like intricate theme parks that connect to headquarters via a narrow bridge. Dreams are created in the dream studios whereas the imagination land houses the odd and mysterious fantasies that are temporarily created by Riley. Then there's the literal train of thought that chugs all around and the pit where discarded memories lay.What makes Inside Out so enjoyable is its depiction of such complex mechanisms of the human mind, simplified in the most artistic manner that can relate to some kids but all adults. So much so that the manifestations that are created by Riley, such as the adorable Bing Bong are merely a part of her growing up. Adults will relate to such themes and the emotions felt by them will perhaps be the opposite of what their kids would feel. An impulsive mistake by sadness sucks Joy, herself and Riley's core memories through the duct that throws them around the islands. In their absence, the headquarters falls in disarray, thus reflecting upon Riley's behavior. She turns cold, aloof and decides upon things she might regret later on. Joy and Sadness have to take whatever help they can get in order to get back to headquarters before it is too late. But the mind is a complex arena of cryptic lanes, creative studios and fantasy characters that won't make the return of such vital emotions easy. Peter Docter has visualized a very human story that each of us can relate to. If 'Up' was all about not letting go of a life that's dear to you and believing in it if there's nothing to lose, Inside Out shows the lighter side of how the growing up stage works inside a child's head. The emotions aren't battling it out for supremacy in the mind but are actually playing their own little parts to keep their human from struggling in life. Riley couldn't let go of her past self and adaptation was a challenge she simply couldn't overcome but with Joy at the control center of her mind's headquarters, she was in good hands. This is Pixar's return to form and perhaps the most important film to watch this year while superheroes and monsters from the past grab your summer's attention. The animation is ground-breaking once again and not because it is state-of-the-art but because it exploits the potential of such art for a compelling story that couldn't have been depicted in any other way. You will fall in love with all the characters especially Joy, Sadness, Bing Bong, Anger and Riley herself. Brilliantly conceived and adroitly directed, Inside Out is a must watch.9.001 on a scale of 1-10.","

I don't think you can sell your $300k house and roll into a $2M fixer-upper.This is the one movie (of ~600, all from BD/DVDs we own, mind you) my wife said: ""Don't bother to put this one on the server. Nothing about it was good.""Both of us, SF tech boom people. Through 3 booms. And both of us originally from Midwest, but have lived all over (every major ""tech town"").I play with CGI but it wasn't even redeeming for that. Nothing struck me as ""wow!"" in the tech used to make the movie. Really... it felt like Pixar parents telling their own story, not very creatively and on a tighter budget. Oh well.","

"INSIDE OUT","FW_MovieFan","4 May 2020","I just got home from seeing Inside Out with my wife. We both thought it was the absolute worst movie Pixar has ever done.I am a huge fan of Pixar's movies - they've done so many that are so astoundingly good, it's hard to say which one is the best. This movie, on the other hand, easily qualifies as their worst ever. No charm, no humor, no engaging, memorable characters. I kept waiting and waiting for the story to become what other Pixar movies have had - at least some humor or charm or something compelling to keep you watching. It had none of these things. It was a sad, depressing, boring, lackluster affair from start to finish. I'm truly amazed that so many people have found this to be one of Pixar's best efforts. It doesn't even come close to the Toy Story movies, A Bug's Life or my favorite, Finding Nemo. On a scale of 1 to 10, IMHO, Inside Out isn't even on the scale.If you're thinking about going to see it, don't waste your money! A truly awful effort from a company that has set the bar incredibly high and failed, miserably, to live up to that bar.Hugely disappointing.","

"INSIDE OUT","Finfrosk86","9 January 2011","Caught an early screening of this at Cinemateket, Oslo. Nice! Because it premieres here in late August. Wah-wah.Having seen several good reviews and scores, I went into this expecting something pretty great. Albeit, I also heard great things about Up and Toy Story 3, which I found to be overrated, but in this case, what was said, was mostly true.This movie has a lot of really smart writing. The main idea is really good, and all the small details are super fun, the story in general, as in plot is nothing too special, but it works.But as I said, what really makes this stand out is the smartness of a lot of the jokes and ideas. The big jokes, main jokes, if you will, I didn't find all that funny, but the small details, those made me chuckle. A chuckle that both said: that's pretty funny, and wow that's really smart.Funny thing, a couple of times during the movie I thought to myself, 'ah, so that's how my brain works'. Haha, then followed by, 'no wait, we know emotions aren't tiny creatures living in our brains'.. right? My point being, it's really plausible and well made.The animation is of course superb, didn't expect anything less. The voice cast is also top notch. I did find a couple of things with the script to be a little lazy, actually, and really felt it took the movie down a notch. I was rather surprised at some parts, well one in particular, giving the fact that most of the movie is so smart.I had heard that it was supposed to be very sad, or touching in some parts, but it didn't really get to me as much as I'd hoped.(not trying to be tough here, I love being touched and sad by movies)All in all this is a well made, entertaining, smartly written (for the most part) movie with heart. Well done.How soon will the sequel be announced? and spin-off? This could potentially be a huge franchise.","

"INSIDE OUT","thegreatbelly","28 November 2010","It seems like the message that the writers of ""Inside Out"" were trying to pass on to its audience (adults and children alike) was ""It's OK to feel sad when traumatic events happen in your life."" But instead, it came across more as ""Feeling optimistic and trying to be happy in the face of adversity isn't realistic and is actually harmful to your mental well-being, Sadness is IMPORTANT and you have to let your Sadness run free when bad things happen."" The core concept of the movie-- personifying the emotions that drive us-- is an interesting one, but they run into a major problem. By personifying an emotion like Sadness, you take something that is a tragically everyday part of life, and turn it into a cute green lump with her own personality and emotions. So instead of being an abstract concept that really sucks to experience, Sadness is now somebody you have to root for and cheer on. So when the climax of the movie hits, the film-makers are trying to get you to cheer Sadness on. Go Sadness, we're on your side, feel important and save the day! Meanwhile, Riley, the actual girl, has Sadness take over her mind, corrupting her happy memories that shape her entire personality, and realistically the experience would leave the girl with depression that she has to spend the rest of her life treating. But hey, that green blob get's to feel special for a while, so it's all good, right? Hurrah, kid's movie! Inside Out does have plenty of funny moments, and a solid voice cast, but it is ultimately majorly dragged down by both a script that tries to be deep and insightful but completely bungles the execution, and a story that feels artificially drawn out, making the hour-and-a-half run-time drag at times, making the movie possibly Pixar's worst (though to be fair, I haven't seen either of the Cars movies yet).","

"INSIDE OUT","leonblackwood","6 April 2011","Review: I really liked the concept of this movie because it was fresh and original but I was a bit disappointed with the outcome. Like many Pixar movies, it looked amazing and the attention to detail was great but the storyline dried up after a while and I personally thought that it was a bit confusing for little kids. It's about a young girl called Riley, voiced by Kaitlyn Dias, who moves to San Francisco from Minnesota with her parents and finds it hard to fit in. Whilst going through her transitions, we get to look at her Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness emotions which are going through turmoil after her Joy and Sadness emotions lose some of her core memories. After retrieving the memories, they struggle to get back to there headquarters which means that Riley is stuck with her Fear, Anger and Disgust emotions. When Joy and Sadness manage to get back to there headquarters, Riley is able to lead a normal life in her new house but as she gets older, the headquarters becomes bigger because of her many new emotions, including puberty. Its a clever storyline with some funny moments but I would have liked to see the other emotions a bit more, especially Anger, who made me laugh. The bonus material on the DVD should have been used in the film because it was brilliant. It showed the different emotions of her dad and mother while Riley was going out with a boy, so if you get your hands on the DVD/Blu- ray, you really have to give it a watch. Anyway, there isn't much adult material, like in other Pixar movies but it's fun for the whole family. I did miss the catchy songs and the usual mean villain but there is enough material to keep it interesting. My expectations are always high when it comes to Pixar animation movies so I did feel a bit let down with the outcome. It's not the type of film that I can watch time and time again like Toy Story or the Incredibles but if you want to keep the kids quiet, it's worth a purchase. Average!Round-Up: After reading the reviews and seeing the box office takings, this film really went down a storm with audiences but I failed to find it that amazing. The vibrant colours and joyful storyline is a great escape from the doom and gloom of everyday life, so I can understand why people rushed to the cinema to see it. There are a couple of famous stars who voiced the characters, like Amy Poehler as Joy, Bill Hader as Fear, Diane Lane as Mom and Kyle MacLachlan as Dad but there not that noticeable. The film was directed by Pete Doctor, 47, who brought you the emotional Up and Monsters, Inc. and he also wrote Wall-E, Toy Story I & II, so he has had much success in his career so far. It was also directed by Ronnie Del Carmen but he hasn't made any other movies yet.  Anyway, I enjoyed some elements of the movie but on the whole, I have sent better films in this genre. Budget: $175million Worldwide Gross: $851.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/adventure/comedies voiced by Amy Poehler, Richard Kind, Bill Hader, Diane Lane, Kyle MacLachlan, Frank Oz and Phyllis Smith. 5/10","

"INSIDE OUT","rudolfravbar","9 January 2021","Pixar is back! And good as always. I'll just say, if you didn't already, go watch this movie!Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness. The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley's mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.After a lot of time (for me, since Toy Story 3) we got another awesome Pixar movie. The story is really, really good. I can easily say that this movie is for both, parents and children. For parents because it has something that kids won't understand, like growing up and stuff, but kinds will like jokes and funny moments. I was impressed because there are NO FART JOKES! Like in other new animated films, there is some humor that some kids won't understand.The voice actors did great. Amy Poehler (Joy), Phyllis Smith (Sadness), Bill Hader (Fear) and Lewis Black (Anger). They were just awesome. There are not many clichés. Sound effects are good as well. Animations are just great. There is one scene when shelves with memories are falling, and after that I was being like:"" In your face, San Andreas!"" Trust me, that scene is brutal.Pete Docter did a great job as well (writer and director). He is one of the best director and writer for animated movies. He is like... Awesome. He made Up, Monsters Inc., Toy Story and Wall-e. He is unstoppable!Well, this movie is great, but it has only one sin and, of course, that are clichés. No movie is without them. I can easily say that we already have Oscar winner for Best Animated Feature Film Of The Year.","

"INSIDE OUT","Kubricksboy","26 April 2011","People say never to play with someone's emotions because it might hurt them. But in what way, many of us may wonder? Well here's your answer, Inside Out portrays the game your emotions play in a way no movie has ever done before, to an extent no movie will ever go hereafter. An emotional ride, a literal emotional ride which is as joy as it is sad to watch, which will show what anger and disgust feel like while carefully portraying fear, all in the mind of Riley, our protagonist or so we think because that's what the movie is trying to do, to make us think and think we will for there isn't another animated film more engaging in the genre of drama. Why do you sometimes feel lost? Why can't you sometimes anything? How are your feelings lost? The film answers all such questions with an extremely controlled grasp on the imagination of it's creators. The execution of the film being near perfect it only makes the story look more magnificent than it already is. Pete Doctor and Pixar deliver again an animated movie which the world of cinema lovers will cherish for years to come. A genuine story so original that every second of it has something new to offer to the audience. The actors and actresses who though only use their voices portray the individual emotions to a stellar extent. Sadness being the best of all emotions both acting-vise and character-vise stands out with joy giving tough competition to sadness again both acting-vice and character-vice. The background score though not very impressive but engaging through out the second act but that's not what you will be busy listening, you will be busy praising the highly imaginative story . To sum up in one line. It is one of very few original films out there which no Film lover should miss.","

The way they tackle the teenage mind and how it functions is incredible, especially while able to add humor in the mix. The angle they approach the discussion of depression is remarkable. The movie will take you on a emotional rollercoaster. Even Mr. Macho might shed some tears. As some people might say it is too heavy for kids, I beg the question how do you know your kid isn't feeling this way currently? As you leave the theatre in tears it forces you to ponder the question what is going on inside thier head, and allows us to reevaluate our out look on life.","

"INSIDE OUT","bob the moo","15 April 2011","By the time I finally got to see this film, I had already heard lots of praise for it, lots of talking head mulling over whether it has a shot at Best Picture (not just animated), and lots of other things that told me this was supposed to be a great film. Of course, even without this, the film still has the weight of other great Pixar movies down the years, so it already has a high bar to clear even without the additional hype. Watching it for myself though I was surprised by how little I thought of such things, and how totally I just enjoyed the film on its own terms. Ironically, I did this because of how accurate all the positive reviews and buzz were, because Inside Out is a really great film.Constructed on a reality which all parents of older children will no doubt connect to, the film takes the emotional change of a girl into a young teenager and puts it into a comedic adventure story set inside her head. The world inside her head is not only engaging, but incredibly smart – how accurate it is to the real world of psychology (if those words fit together) I do not know, but it is impressively constructed and also designed to make sense, be accessible, and also create a world for colorful characters to delight on an adventure level while also carrying the emotional punch to deliver a much bigger story (although also a very personal one too). It is as moving as it is funny, and as insightful and as it fun, and it is impressive how it is all put together. The animation is topnotch as ever, and the voice cast are not just famous names but well cast famous names who fit their characters well – with Poehler being a strong lead, while Smith, Black, Kaling, and Hader all doing great work (along with many other supporting characters – not least of which being Dias as Riley herself).I doubt voters would be able to bring themselves to vote for it to win Best Picture while being 'just a cartoon' but at the same time it is hard to imagine that 2015 will produce a better, smarter, and more effective film.","

"INSIDE OUT","Robert_duder","1 July 2011","Make one or two or three good movies and people will say ""Oh I love their movies"" or ""Yah I'll give them a shot"" but what about if you've made 15 great movies? What about if the majority of those were solid 10/10's? At this point, I wouldn't believe if Pixar couldn't make a great film so I had every expectation of Inside Out being a home-run and it is! Is it my favourite Pixar film? No, not by a long shot but there are parts of this movie that are stone-cold brilliant and some things about it that make it less than outstanding as some of Pixar's previous films. Still, Inside Out is brilliant when it comes to concept. And its also brilliant for the reason Pixar films are and that is the sheer detail that goes into these films. They don't make their animated films with the demographic of children in mind but rather the demographic of everyone. These are films that anyone can watch and like at an equal level. Still, some of there movies tend to be a touch dark and deal with some very intense emotions (pun intended.) They don't shy away from real life lessons and the reality of life (death, marriage, love etc) Inside Out is no exception. There are some heavy duty lessons here and some definitive dark moments so be wary if showing to the real youngsters.Amy Poehler is magnificent as Joy. Her character isn't quite as strong as a lead should be but Poehler captures the character well and her voice isn't as recognizable as you'd think. She definitely makes the character come to life. Phyllis Smith might be the true star of the movie as the adorable and heart wrenching sadness. She gets the character arc and the heroic moment and her and Poehler play off each other perfectly. Smith is literally ideal for the role. Richard Kind is great as Riley's childhood imaginary friend Bing Bong. I don't really think they use him enough actually and his story is definitely heart wrenching as well and has some real morals behind it. Bill Hader, Lewis Black (who else could be anger!?) and Mindy Kaling all perform their roles very well. Each one is perfectly suited to their character/emotional counterpart. Kaitlyn Dias is great as Riley and Mom and Dad are perfectly done by Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan. One of the best things about this cast is outside of a couple of them like Phyllis Smith and Lewis Black who just naturally fit their roles, you don't recognize some of the bigger stars' voices like Poehler, Hader, Lane and MacLachlan. They sink into their characters and that is a compliment.Inside Out is a completely unique look at the human psyche. The way they turn the brain into a factory like production with these adorable creatures is brilliant. They cover such an insane amount of topics that have to do with memories and emotions that as an adult, it really actually makes you think and really hits home and I think kids will just enjoy the adventure. Pete Doctor (who is a Pixar genius...Toy Story, Monsters' Inc, Wall-E, Up) and Ronnie Del Carmen who might not have the directorial chops but he has worked art direction on several Pixar projects do a really terrific job bringing this world to life. They seamlessly go from the real world to Riley's brain and they even take the time to show some of the other people around her and how their emotions work. Doctor knows how to play to the audience's deep seeded emotions (Up being one of the greatest films ever made period) and he does it again in a slightly lighter way this time around. Inside Out is a must see and while it isn't an instant classic like Up or Wall-E, it still is such a powerfully made, brilliantly visual film with an incredibly unique story that the family can share. 8.5/10","

"INSIDE OUT","Seraphion","29 September 2018","Somehow I don't really think that this movie is really suitable for parents to bring kids to watch. The basic concept is either too technical or too philosophical altogether. The concepts of humans' five basic emotions is well beyond the grasp of an elementary school kid, let alone a toddler. Even though the movie gets to be more and more reasonable as it goes on, still it won't be such a good experience to share about. The animation is nice, it doesn't have overly weird or disproportional drawing styles or camera angles that will further confuse children audiences. And the voice acting is nicely expressive. That should balance the things that this movie lacks.","

This is probably considered, if not the most, one of the most clever films they've made thus far. A very unique story about the inside of a persons brain in a creative and imaginative fashion. If you know the basics of Psychology, then this film is better understandable. Joy was a really fun character, Anger and Fear were easily the most comedic, and Riley was very sweet as well. Maybe not quite as much of an instant classic compared to some of their other films, but a lot of the credit for this one goes to the clever ideas and of course, to Pixar's usual charm also. Quite a definite keeper. I will always love their films to come.","

For over a decade, Riley's emotions – led by the exuberant Joy (Amy Poehler) – have helped their girl navigate the ups and downs of life, ensuring that even the most challenging days result in happy memories. When Riley's father takes on a stressful new job in San Francisco, the Minnesotan pre-teen tries to be positive about the family move, buoyed by the Joy's can-do attitude.As Joy attempts to keep Riley focused on the bright side of life, the young girl faces disappointments that throw her emotions into chaos. In a desperate attempt to regain control, Joy tampers with Riley's memory logging system, which inadvertently leaves Joy and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) stranded in the maze of Long Term Memory. As Riley faces one frustrating situation after another in the world, Disgust (Mindy Kaling), Fear (Bill Hader), and Anger (Lewis Black) attempt to keep their girl from mental collapse, while Joy and Sadness embark on a dangerous trek back to ""Headquarters.""After the release of Toy Story 3, Pixar hit a slump in their movies being lackluster. Moreover, fans were starting to question whether Pixar was collapsing, and whether they would be making any original films instead of sequels/prequels. It's clear, given the announcement of Toy Story 4, Cars 3, Finding Dory, and The Incredibles 2, that sequels are now a key piece of Pixar's production slate; yet, there's nothing quite like a fresh Pixar tale. Inside Out is the best Pixar film in years, blending thought-provoking human drama (for kids and adults) with an imaginative premise and whimsical adventure – a must-see for children, parents, and cinephiles alike.Director Pete Docter, who had directed Up and Monsters Inc, has created a beautiful and dynamic film. The story setup and balance between Riley's real life conflicts and the fantastical internal drama of her emotions, is fertile ground in both visual sophistication and narrative punch. Riley's emotions color her view of the world – literally (through shifts in visual tone) and figuratively (as she reacts to events in the story). This combination of vibrant fantasy and real-world challenges is the hallmark of Pixar's most iconic and groundbreaking films, which depicts a deeply emotional story through unique perspectives.For Inside Out, Pixar anthropomorphizes emotion – with a new set of colorful characters for young viewers to enjoy, while also exploring one of mankind's greatest mysteries: the mind. Delving into psychology theory, Docter injects entertaining but equally sophisticated insight into how emotions influence behavior – insight that affords Inside Out's audience a chance for self-discovery and reflection, regardless of age.Amy Poehler leads the voice cast as Joy – a familiar fit (in all the right ways) for the comedy actress. Docter imbues Joy, along with the rest of Riley's emotions, with layered personalities – even though they're each representative of a single ""feeling."" The characters are ripe for gags that play off their emotional namesakes (ex., Anger is a hothead) but Inside Out manages to find a deeper level for the protagonists on the inside – the same nuance that differentiated past Pixar animation films from their contemporaries. As a result, Joy struggles with her own fear, disgust, sadness, and anger – breathing life into what could have been a gimmicky outline (while also contributing to the movie's larger message of emotional maturation).Smith leads the supporting cast, providing the same depth to Sadness that is given to Joy – and, in spite of Poehler's energetic leading role, Sadness is instrumental in many of Inside Out's funniest and most impactful scenes. Kaling, Hader, and Black are given less to do, but their characters are not afterthoughts. Docter ensures each has a spotlight to shine in the movie, and makes it apparent that each emotion is essential in maintaining Riley's safety and happiness.As indicated, Inside Out also makes a genuine effort to juxtapose the zany cartoon hijinks of Riley's mind with relatable and heartwarming real-world drama. Docter dedicates a significant amount of his runtime to life in San Francisco, as Riley and her parents endeavor to carve out a new home there. Thanks to Pixar's evolving depiction of CG people, Inside Out accurately animates micro-expressions and body language that are crucial in non- verbal comprehension of emotion. Riley isn't necessarily the most realistic person that Pixar has ever animated, but instead of striving for photorealism, the studio takes advantage of Inside Out's cartoonish style to accentuate human emotion – delivering some of the most expressive CG characters in animation history.After years of cashing-in on established film franchises, Inside Out is a much-appreciated return to form for Pixar Animation. In an industry that is packed with CG animation studios, many of which have made significant strides in quality over the years, Docter's latest film offers a sobering reminder of the invention and heart that turned Pixar into one of Hollywood's most beloved (and bankable) brands. More than an entertaining film, Inside Out is an important reflection on the power of emotion – and proof that Pixar is still king of imaginative CG animated storytelling.","

"INSIDE OUT","arteminimal","7 December 2011","Pixar has been the most daring animated movie studio this side of Japan. With marvelous examples like UP, WALL-E and Finding Nemo they always find the proper way to introduce themes that many deemed too heavy for children and in a way that's both moving and thought provoking, like life after the loss of someone we love, loneliness, social alienation and mourning.And now, we have Inside Out, the latest Pixar's work in an already fantastic oeuvre, and while it does not have the powerful drama and character development of UP or the magnificently executed reflection on solitude that was WALL-E it's no less complex as Inside Out choose to tackle something even more immediate: the complexity in our identity.Riley's personality is well built and relatable, quite an achievement since, if we are strict, we could consider her a big plot vehicle for the true protagonists: Joy and Sadness. The way these two interact with each other and with Riley's identity –cleverly presented as a set of corridors of memory and isles of identity– is a phenomenal example of intelligent animation. When you are sitting there just smiling to yourself about the brilliance of Pixar introducing psychoanalysis concepts to an audience composed mainly of children and explaining these concepts with clear and understandable visual metaphors you know you're witnessing something special.And of course, being a Pixar movie, the emotive scenes are there, ready to move you and take you with them. There's charm, there are laughs. There's plenty of what's lacking in the movies of Dreamworks and others: there's heart.I attended the premiere with my fiancée and my mother, who studied child psychology and worked with children with special needs for years and in the end she told us, with tears in her eyes: I never imagined something like this would ever be done. For my mother it was so moving and complex that she could not believe that children where understanding the movie so well.However, I'm a little skeptical and that's why I'm not ready to give this movie the full 10/10. The movie is indeed complex, maybe too complex sometimes, and I think I saw a couple of children –and adults– not understanding many aspects of this fine film. One clear example was the abstract thoughts chamber. I don't think all of us are ready for something this clever, at least not in this format. However I welcome it with arms wide open. It is time we start respecting the intelligence of children.Now, it's time for me to finish this, think about the movie for a while and take my imaginary friend to the moon.","

"INSIDE OUT","rannynm","12 February 2011","Ladies and gentlemen, we have a masterpiece on our hands. Pixar has done it again. They already lay claim to two of the top 100 movies of all-time with Up and Wall-E and they have now added Inside Out to their mantelpiece. I will gladly go on record by calling this one of the finest animated features to ever be created. Why? Because it's THE most innovative, imaginative and creative film to be made since 2008s Synecdoche, New York.The beautiful thing about this movie is that both adults and children can enjoy it. As a matter of fact, I'd say that adults may enjoy it more, because they can have a more fundamental understanding of what this film is. It is 100 minutes of analogous brilliance, that changes our idea of what goes on in our heads. Is this idea fathomable or true? No. But the analogy provides the very product film was invented to produce: a stimulation of the imagination. Children will enjoy the beautiful colors and the basic plot. What the children can understand is what they can relate to: growing up and adjusting to life as they enter puberty. They will laugh at things that SEEM funny or the more, for lack of better word, simple pieces of humor. But the true jokes, the pieces of humor that have the most intellect are the ones children won't understand. I appreciate those the most because they're fathomable. It's the moment when you laugh, not because the joke is ridiculous, but because you can actually imagine that happening.Amidst the hilarity there is also a certain depth of emotion. There is a tear-jerking moment, yes, but I mean more along the lines of nostalgia. The way the movie portrays the effects of the emotions and the rationalization that go along with them, conjure a desire to reflect on oneself in their pre-teen days. This film may literally get into the mind of a pre-teen, but the metaphorical representation is what seals the reflection. ""I was like that?"", ""Is that how I thought then...I that how I think now?"" may be questions you find yourself asking yourself. These are the effects of a brilliant screenplay.On a final and personal note, I'll tell this short story. There is a scene in the film, where two officers are questioning a cloud in Imagination Land about her dead husband. Then, in the middle of the interrogation the cloud herself is killed as she is run through by our main character. One cop goes, ""Hey wait..."", but as he says that, the other cop grabs him and says, ""Forget it Jake, it's Cloud Town."" Get it? It's a parody of the famous final words from the classic 1974 noir, Chinatown. I'll tell you, it wasn't very comfortable being the only person in the theater laughing at that joke. It's just one joke amongst many. Beyond the hilarity and, mainly due to the aforementioned reasons I explained, I happily give this instant classic 5 out of 5 stars. I recommend it for ages 7 to 18.This film will be released on DVD/Blu-ray/Digital on November 3 and its bonus features are very informative and engaging. They give wonderful insights to the making of the movie. The feature, Story of the Story really tells you how much thinking went into this story. Mixed Emotions and Mapping the Mind go hand in hand as they provide both characterizations of the emotions and scientific findings pertaining to our emotions. There are also great features about the underrated parts of making this movie, like how the score was created and what the editing was like. My favorite of all of them, is the short film Lava which has become one of my favorite short films.Reviewed by Willie J., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, age 16.","

"INSIDE OUT","imaginativehooliganpaul","17 August 2021","In the beginning of 'Inside Out' it seemed like it was going to be a good, fun story. We were instantly intrigued with the characters in Riley's head as they entertainingly worked together as Riley's emotions. Then, Joy and Sadness got lost from headquarters and the movie began on it's downward plummet...towards a stressful, unorganized, Hodge-Podge of frustration! They encountered obstacle after obstacle until we were so ready for this movie to be over. It seemed to be annoying for adults and confusing for children. The movie just didn't work, there were not even close the amount of emotions necessary to compare to the complexity of the human mind, and the story of Riley wanting to take a bus back to Minnesota by herself thinking it would make her happy was ridiculous. Bing Bong, seemed like a very cliché imaginary friend, with nothing special to him to make him a supporting character. Especially if you compare him to other Pixar films supporting roles who we know and love such as Dory and Mike Wasowski. We found Sadness annoying, and every time we heard her talk we just thought of Phyllis Smith's role, Phyllis, in the Office talking. :)Joy was not one of the emotions we had while watching this movie. It dared to live up to the fun filled family films that Pixar has created before, such as Finding Nemo, Monster's Inc., and Ratatouille, but it failed to do so. It was not fun. In all honesty, after watching this movie we thought it to be quite possible this movie was created by a drunk woman during her time of month. We hope Pixar can get back on track with their next movie.","

"INSIDE OUT","view_and_review","23 June 2021","It was a normal Saturday. I was rather upbeat and delighted to take the family to see Inside Out. Pixar usually does so well with their movies that I knew this would be another animated favorite. Well I didn't leave the theater as upbeat as I'd gone in. Inside Out was one of the more morose animations I've seen in a long time. I don't think I've been this down watching a Disney animation since Bambi's mother was killed.The premise of Inside Out was much like the 90's sitcom Herman's Head: emotions are represented in the head of the main character as individual characters. There was Joy, Sadness, Anger, Caution and Disgust. Joy was definitely the dominant character. She monopolized most of the emotional time, which is good, until something went awry. Then Riley, the main character whose head we were looking into, went from joyful to a state of depression and apathy, and not in a funny way. The movie hit a real somber and even dark note and stayed there for some time. Now, we're talking about a Disney movie so of course there was a happy ending but I don't think it was nearly happy enough to overcome the incredibly dampened mood that was cast over the movie. I remember quietly commenting that this girl needs a therapist.The movie had a good message and put a good spin on the need and meaning of our more negative emotions. Small parts of the movie went off the rails and I think that's because it was taking place inside someone's head. Anything is possible inside someone's mind and how do you graphically represent some of the things in a mind? It was a difficult story Pixar tried to tackle and they did OK.","

"INSIDE OUT","Horst_In_Translation","3 July 2020","It has been quite some time since ""Up"", the last full feature movie Pete Docter directed, but he hasn't forgotten anything in these past 5 years. ""Inside Out"" runs for slightly over 100 minutes and is a most creative take on what is going on inside a young girl's head when she has to leave her home state Minnesota to move to San Francisco. There are 5 states of emotion inside her head, all in different colors: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust. I have to say I was quite wondering for a large part of the film why 4 are negative and only one is positive. My explanation is probably that from the filmmaker's perspective it made sense as the positive one and one of the negative ones are absent for a while and this is when the girl is at her worst.I thought this movie needed a little while to really get going. It got better when Joy and Sadness left the central and we actually had one positive and one negative emotion in the center of the movie and also the characters they meet on their journey together. The most memorable of these is probably Bing Bong, an imaginary friend the girl had when she was younger. The disappearance of Bing Bong is also one of the most emotional moments down in the dark valley of lost memories. This valley was an inclusion as smart as the one that all memories are stored in balls. Another part I liked from a more positive perspective was the one scene where we see the girl ice skating and we see Joy do exactly the same in a synchronous manner, possibly my favorite moment from the first half of the movie.The ending is absolutely brilliant again, Pixar at their best. It already starts with the Bing Bong scene I mentioned earlier, but it keeps going until the very end. The moment we see Joy let Sadness touch these balls of the past, so these memories stop being pleasant, but become sad memories is something that will wet your eyes. It's necessary to see these as sad in order to make space for new positive memories. And the home sickness scene that follows right afterwards is at least as good with the girl and her parents hugging it out.It's tough to find any criticism with this movie. Maybe one would be that I did not like the first half as much as the second half and that with all the displays of great animation and creativity, the movie sometimes had long sequences that lacked being really funny. Or that they were some childish scenes early on like the constant monkey imitation game, which certainly elaborates on the characters' relationships, but may have been enough once or twice. ""Inside Out"" is the big front-runner for animated movie of the year and very likely to win the Oscar in that category. Deservedly so. This is on par with Pixar's best, especially towards the end. I saw that there will be a little short film that follows the feature film and I am curious about how this is gonna look like. Oh yeah, I also liked how they went into other people's heads occasionally, such as the parents, or some others during the closing credits. This really brought some nice comic relief.All in all, ""Inside Out"" is another triumph for both Pixar and Disney. The younger audiences will have a fun time with all the colorful and entertaining characters and the grown-ups will as well because of the emotional impact this movie makes. Highly recommended and finally also a quick word on ""Lava"", a short film that is shown before the movie in theaters and has a beautiful storyline and music as well: I did not like the German dub as much as the English original, but it was still an entertaining 5-6 minutes. Do not miss out on these two, because you would really miss out on a lot of awesomeness.","

"INSIDE OUT","jimel98","24 November 2016","I took my granddaughter to see this and dammnit, I want to see it again. It's funny, simply FUNNY. I won't bore you with a recap of the plot as you can see that about a dozen different places on this site. I'll just give you my take, the opinion of a 55 year old guy. I laughed my butt off quite a few times, and when I wasn't laughing, I was a bit misty eyed.It's brilliantly written for every age group and anyone who doesn't appreciate the cleverness that transcends age, gender and species (trust me...)you must be one very dull person. Sorry, but that's how I see it.It shows a situation many have dealt with (moving to a new place and trying to adjust) and even though I've never had to experience that, I've known folks who've had to and this hits the mark. It also hits the mark on the though processes we all face in every day life in a very humorous way and by a wonderful cast.If you're human (or a dog or a cat...wait 'til the end!) you can identify with this and might find yourself saying....I wonder just how much of this might be kind of true.And yeah, as I watched it, I hearkened back to ""Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask"" and numerous similar ""inside the body"" movies. Each has had it's strengths, THIS ONE is strong start to finish.","

"INSIDE OUT","jay-techie2007","28 March 2011","Inside Out comes across as a very successful attempt by Pixar studios on a very audacious plot. The movie took me by surprise by the sheer creativity that went into every single detail of the story. It is a very difficult movie to execute and Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen pulls it off amazingly well. The story takes a look into various emotions (joy, sadness, fear, anger and disgust) of a young 10 something girl who is brought to a completely new neighborhood and culture - from MidWest to West Coast. At a higher level, it shows how our emotions play a very important role in our reactions to day to day situations, which is why controlling them becomes all the more important for long term happiness. I loved the boldness of the concept and the imaginative power that went behind writing the script. The animation is not as great as Pixar's earlier movies but does enough justice to the general benchmark of animation quality that has been set these days. However, overall, the movie is a great watch for the sake of the brilliant plot and brilliant imagination that has went into creating this amazing movie. After watching it, I started analyzing my reactions against the five emotions and understanding how each emotion would have led to a different reaction to the same situation.","

Only gave 2 for the animation, otherwise, it would have been 1 when considering the enjoy factor it provided. The story is way too boring, the ""mind"" characters are devastatingly annoying. Not funny enough for a children movie. The message it tries to communicate is overly artificial, contrived and shallow. I terribly regret wasting the time watching it, waiting for it to become better. It was a real pain watching it, in the end. Cannot understand how it has a rating over 8.","

"INSIDE OUT","alexwebb32","19 December 2011","I had high expectations for this movie, and I was quite disappointed when I finished it. I really hope Pixar does better next time, because this is not good enough.The people who gave it an 8, 9 or 10 out of 10 need to calm down though, and so do the people who gave it a 1, 2 or 3. It's definitely not amazing, but it's definitely not ""the worst"" either. Those who say it's one of the two are exaggerating. Personally, I think it's mediocre. It has some fun, interesting elements to it, and the concept is original. It starts out quite interesting, the beginning is the best part, but the rest is not as good. It relies heavily on clichés, and none of the characters feel original. None of them develop much either, not even the main character, they're predictable and quite boring. Actually, you don't really get to know them, not even Riley, which is pretty ridiculous considering the movie is set inside her head. The parts that are supposed to make you laugh only make you smile awkwardly, because they're so cliché. There is no ""wow factor"", and the ending was predictable. Definitely not what I would expect from Pixar.I wouldn't recommend or discourage people from watching it though, as some may enjoy it, but people probably shouldn't get their hopes up.","

"INSIDE OUT","dave118118","2 March 2011","I was in a packed screening of Inside Out at the Birmingham Everyman cinema on Saturday, consisting almost entirely of adults. Absolutely incredible movie and an early contender for the best picture Oscar. Can't remember the last time a film completely dazzled me like that.It was overwhelmingly brilliant from the outset and the short 'Lava' set the tone beautifully. I feel as though Pixar have pushed boundaries here in terms of revolutionising the target demographic of animated films. It almost felt that this was a film aimed at adults with lots of winks for the kids rather than vice versa.I like the way Pixar have scaled down the plot to something we've all seen before; kid moves to new place and find it tough to adjust, nothing new here. Yet Pixar managed to use this simple story arc to run havoc with their imaginations as to what happens within ones self at a time like this.Hats off to Pixar for creating this stunning, intensely emotional family film. Still feeling all the feels.","

Her five emotions Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) are in chaos. Joy and Sadness get dumped into Long Term Memory leaving Fear, Disgust, and Anger in charge. Joy and Sadness try to return to headquarter with the help of childhood imaginary friend Bing Bong (Richard Kind).It's an emotional coming-of-age movie. It's brightly-colored imaginative representation of our emotions. Amy Poehler does a great voice performance. Bing Bong has one of the most emotional moment in the movie. It is touching. On a side note, I doubt this is a good movie for the little ones. This is not a simple brightly-coated candy movie. It requires some understanding that the really young would have trouble with.","

"INSIDE OUT","gayanjani","31 March 2011","I am genuinely confused as to why people are calling this ""Pixar's Best"" or an original concept. Pixar has done far better than this and even the mediocre 'Brave' and 'Cars' are far better.Not only is the concept of 'people controlling your brain' tired and used multiple times, they managed to make it even more boring. There is absolutely no nuance in this film. The characters, (joy, anger, fear, disgust, sadness), are a visual representation of their emotion. I mean seriously, do they understand subtlety at all? Anger literally catches on fire, sadness is blue, and joy looks like every boring same-faced cartoon princess. Not to mention none of the emotions look like Riley, the little girl. This is even more of a flaw when we later see the emotions in other characters heads, (Riley's parents, her teacher, etc.) who look just like the person whose brain they inhabit. Why would Riley be the only one whose emotions all look nothing like her? They took an old concept, made it incredibly literal, and then botched it up with inconsistencies. Aside from the boring concept, this movie is way too complex and depressing for children. The plot is nearly nonexistent and the most constant thing throughout is joy and sadness attempting to get back to the control center of Riley's brain after being sucked out by accident. Other than that its all very dull and if it doesn't make you cry, you'll probably fall asleep. There are, from what I remember, no laugh out loud jokes. Way too much time went into world-building and showing off the various landscapes and rooms of Riley's mind for there to be any actual storyline. Everything felt extremely dragged out and joy and sadness ran into obstacle after obstacle trying to get back to the control center. Finally, Riley tries to run away and it just so happens that joy returns and fixes everything before she has the chance to get too far. Not only was it absurd for an 11 year old girl to try and take a bus back home, it was far too sad the way the whole thing was shown. There were so many random characters introduced for 5 seconds which served no purpose other than to lighten the mood, and they failed at that too. Bing Bong the imaginary friend who was a furry pink elephant was out of place and his design was really uncreative. When he died, I honestly felt relieved not to hear his irritating voice any more. He had no personality or character development and therefore there wasn't any reason to feel sad when he died. Unles of course you're a little kid in which case the whole thing was way too heavy. Either way its a definite miss.And for those saying only psychology majors can enjoy this movie, that's not true. I can't imagine anyone honestly liking this movie. Aside from the complete inaccuracy of anyone feeling only one emotion at a time, everything about this movie was casually ableist. The portrayal of depression as being something small and easily gotten over was incorrect and terrible. Even the advertisements (""Meet the Little Voices Inside Your Head"") felt like an insensitive joke towards people with schizophrenia or other disorders who have auditory hallucinations.Overall, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Too depressing and confusing for kids, too boring and literal for adults, this movie is enjoyable by no one. Pixar did not please its intended audience, nor did it please the grown ups. The one redeeming factor was the animation, which was good but all the designs were so uncreative that good animation couldn't save it.","

"INSIDE OUT","cherold","27 May 2019","Such a wonderful movie, very funny, exciting and affecting. The movie portrays a young girls emotions as competing creatures in her head, and it's wonderful how much it all makes sense. It's apparent that the movie took the premise very seriously and wanted to get it right - this is no Herman's Head (not that I have any problem with Herman's Head).The movie does a beautiful job both in its simple framing story of a girl dealing with the disruption of her life and in the tale of her inner emotions and how they relate and sometimes misunderstand one another. This is of the standard of the best of Pixar, along with Up and Wall-E. A number of people have posted that this movie is more for adults than kids - my girlfriend said the same thing - but I'm not sure if that's true. While it has a sophisticated view of emotion, it's not one that's hard to understand. The characters are relatable and the movie is fast and fun. And kids aren't quite as obtuse as people think. I don't have any kids though, so I'm just guessing that they might like it after all. Having had a traumatic move at age 6, I certainly would have related.","

"INSIDE OUT","lspm-66597","24 June 2011","I have been a Pixar fan since the Luxo Jr. days and watched their acquisition by Disney with trepidation. After seeing Inside Out, it appears that the Disneyfication of Pixar is now complete. This movie is just another one of those execrable Disney Tinkerbell movies with better actors and animation. It is so insipid that I wanted to leave within the first two minutes (ok, I actually wanted to leave during the horrible short that preceded it.) There was much laughter in the audience; all of it from children under the age of 6. Pixar movies always entertained people of all ages with their clever plots, excellent acting, and beautiful graphics. The animation of Inside Out was decent, the cast excellent, but I have nothing good to say about the rest. The plot was extremely derivative. There was absolutely no surprise about what was going to happen - once they set up the premise, it was obvious that we were doomed to another hour of their trying to get back, with mishaps along the way and the inevitable happy ending. It reminded me of the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 rock climbing episode (for those of you in the know). Even my teenager and her friend thought the movie and short were ""babyish"". I'm waiting until they make a princess sequel and have a ride named after it at Disneyland. Bye, bye Pixar. I'll miss you.","

Disney needs to remember they are in the ""entertainment"" business. This is the second movie they have made lately that leaves you feeling worse after you saw it than you were before viewing it. Inside Out begins with a good story line, but sadness (better named depression)is the biggest part of the movie. Yes, there is realism. But, I prefer the ""fantasy"" part of cartoons where one can escape the bad and enjoy a light-hearted laugh for a bit. In my opinion, Disney head's need to see a professional about this depression they feel so compelled to share. I won't waste my money on another movie ticket to a Disney show until can see people laughing when they talk about the new show. I grew up with Disney movies and loved almost all of them. Am so sad that my kids can't have that same joy! This movie was such a waste of talent and time!!! Save your money and watch a DVD at home instead.","

"INSIDE OUT","jaydawiser","11 October 2018","I had high hopes of Inside Out before heading to the movie theater to go see it. The movie had lots of promotion on TV and Disney Channel where kids mainly go to see the exciting movies coming to a theatre near them. Needless to say, I was highly disappointed in this movie. I have to admit that the idea of the story was great and very creative, especially to young children. Other than that, the lack of character development and no good plot development ruined the entire film for me.Almost the entire movie consists of Joy and Sadness walking around that large area of Riley's memories, attempting to find their way back to headquarters, while the other emotions nonchalantly mess everything up (I don't get why Joy was the only emotion with some commonsense). Of course, along the way, they met a spunky elephant (mixed with some other animals) who managed to make situations worse more than making them better, and of course, he had to die at the end because, reality check, it's a Disney film. And their goal is to somehow make you cry one way or another. I just didn't get how the elephant disappeared so quickly, considering he hadn't been down the forgotten memory abyss that long. If the memories died so quickly like he had, why were their thousands of old grey memories still intact? Anyway, that's only a small screw-up compared to the rest of the movie. I felt like I had been constantly waiting for more character development for Riley but once again, I was let down. The entire movie revolved more around the emotions more than Riley, who from the trailer, seemed to be the star of the show. I could go on and on about the huge flaws and plot holes but I only have a limit of a thousand words. Do yourself a favor and spare the $7.50 and wasted hour that you'll never get back. I wouldn't watch that movie again if my life depended on it.","

The most important human emotion is LOVE, not the other ones that play key roles in the movie. And it is LOVE, Mr. Pete Docter, not LAVA, but I guess it is pointless to explain what LOVE is to someone who does not put much value on it.I did not know that children are supposed to scream at parents or throw temper tantrum, or do other crazy things the girl in the movie did when she did not like what her parents did. But according to Pete Docter it is perfectly OK and only natural for a 10 year old to do. Slamming doors in parent's face is OK. Giving them silent treatment is OK, too, according to the directors. But what is really bad, according to the movie, is a healthy veggie pizza! What is really Inside Out is the director's understanding of values and what is good and what is bad.Trust me - your child will get a lot of wrong ideas after watching this piece of junk.

"INSIDE OUT","jakobgf-95","22 June 2019","Now, if you are not completely brainless, you should know that 5 is the middle between 1 and 10 and therefore can tell that i'm NOT rating this Movie below average. The reason i'm writing this before my actual review is that there are a lot of people who do not understand this simple system and think that 7 is average and everything below that is below average. I want you to keep in mind that i don't think that this is a bad movie only because i'm not stuck in Pixar's butt.Personally, i really like Pixar, or rather everything they did before ""Up"" with the exception of ""Cars"", and think the main reason they failed to impress me for the past seven years is Disney itself because the people who run things there are so desperate to make money by this point, that they even started ruining their own classics and do not allow anyone who works for them to be a little bit different because otherwise there would be the possibility to earn a bit less cash.Of course this influences every studio that Disney owns, not just Pixar. So ""Inside out"" is the newest unoriginality to come out of this production line and of course everyone praises it to the point where i actually went to see it even dough i didn't care about it in the slightest.From the trailer, that i personally really liked and not only because it didn't give much away about the actual plot, but i also did find it very funny, i could tell that this would be an enjoyable movie for kids but for some reason i was sure that the jokes used in the trailer where the best ones of the whole movie. Not surprisingly, but sadly, i was almost completely right. There is one other joke that i really loved and one that had the potential to be great but it became to greedy and thus ruining itself. The rest of the humor isn't really my taste but, again, i think that kids will have a good time watching this.The film marketed itself with it's huge load of originality but, as briefly mentioned before, i do not think that is the case. Nearly everything about this film, the concept, the themes, the characters, the sequence of events, almost everything has been done before. But to give credit where credit is due, this is probably one of the better films with this kind of concept.But of course it isn't all bad. There are a few things that i think are creative, for example the way dreams are created, and there is nothing in the whole film that i would describe as bad with the exception of the characters. Basically, we have our human characters who have no personality themselves because they are controlled by other characters who are extremely cut and paste and boring because all of them have only one character trade. Luckily this doesn't count for our main character Joy, but that doesn't mean that she is a good character. That only means the she is the only character who is at least a tiny bit relate-able, but not enough for me to care about her.There are also a million tiny things that don't make any sense like:  Why is sadness so stupid at the beginning? Why can she change the emotion of a memory and others can't? Why has every human being only five emotions? Why do the emotions in other brains all have the same gender and identical hair and in the girls head the genders and hair are different? Why are the emotions sometimes talking about the girl as if she is a different person who is controlled by them, and sometimes like they are all one and the same? Why does she forget how to play Hockey only because her emotions are messed up? Does that also mean she has forgotten almost her entire life near the end? Why can't they make her feel any emotions at that point? And doesn't anyone think it's stupid how they change her emotions instantly, multiple times during specific events? Main example being the scene where the girl slides down a stair railing.As you can see, i have a few problems with the movie. If you think that i shouldn't be so harsh on it because it's a kid's movie, than you also imply that every kid's movie, no matter how bad it is, should be forgiven for it's mistakes because it's made for children. And i think this movie is great for children but for people with a more developed brain, the mistakes a more than present. And because of that i can't give it a better rating. I would probably give it a 6 if the characters weren't so bad but the mistakes compensate the good things and therefore it is completely average for me.","

"INSIDE OUT","zactac","3 February 2016","For the past couples of years we have worried Pixar was losing it's luster. With the over-reliance of sequels it appeared Pixar was on a road to no longer producing gems but coal. However, ""Inside Out"" proved Pixar's ""gem making business"" is not over yet, not by a long shot.The movie deals with a girl named Riley and her move from her hometown in Minnesota to San Francisco. However, the story is mainly told from the perspectives of her five emotions: Joy, Anger, Fear, Disgust, and Sadness. They all work together to keep Riley normal and work even harder to do this once she moves. However, as is expected, something even worse happens leading to a huge adventure throughout Riley's mind.Pixar has not just created another enticing adventure for us but also an engrossing coming-of-age story. Yes, it is brightly colored and filled with hijinks of epic proportions but in the end this is actually a very intimate story of a girl leaving childhood. We all remember those days when we realized our childhoods were ending, and those days were incredibly difficult.As we grow older we find things changes, some small and others big. And the simple truth is change is scary. In fact, it can be pretty terrifying, and that is what Riley deals with in this movie. This is not some story of a girl being spoiled and throwing a temper tantrum, this is the story of a girl finding everything she ever believed in disappearing.Watching this happen from inside her head makes the adventure all the more thrilling. Throughout the movie we watch as both Joy and Sadness work together to get back to Riley and save her from whatever catastrophe that lies ahead. To do this they find themselves in some very amazing locations such as Imagination Land and (a very inspired setting) Dream Productions.These locations add even more layers to the story being told here. Slowly we watch as Riley goes from a happy girl to a child falling into depression. It is very dark, serious subject matter for a kids movie to deal with. In fact, if it was any other studio I doubt they would've had a chance to tell this story correctly.Thankfully Pixar had this story and they knocked it out of the park. They tell the very simple, yet important, truth that it is important to feel all of our emotions. We watch as Riley numbs herself from the pain of what's happened and that takes her to places she would not have gone otherwise. It makes very complex notions easy enough for children to understand while still maintaining the complexity. A remarkable feat for any movie to do.Of course the movie would not be half as enjoyable if it was not for the wonderful voice cast. Amy Poehler was born to play Joy. It would be very easy to make Joy incredibly annoying because of her perky attitude. However, Poehler finds the right balance to make her very charming. The entire cast was also fantastic. Phyllis Smith was perfect as the downer of the group, Sadness. Of course I cannot forget Mindy Kaling (Disgust), Bill Hader (Fear), Lewis Black (Anger), or Richard Kind (Bing Bong) who were all so wonderful.""Inside Out"" was the return to form everyone has been waiting for. Pixar has always been known for greatness so when they have a story that jumps out even more so than usual, people tend to take notice. This is no doubt one of Pixar's very best features and it will go down as an instant classic. With a wonderful message about feeling our emotions instead of numbing them, ""Inside Out"" goes beyond expectations to create an incredibly mature movie going experience for everyone. Yes, the movie deals with these five emotions, but upon leaving the main ones movie goers will feel will be joy and a little bit of sadness.","

"INSIDE OUT","iquine","14 April 2021","(Flash Review)This is the most creative and brilliant way I have ever seen emotions visualized. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing how they envision a person's mind managing emotions and memories in granular ways. Very cool. The core plot is about the 5 primary emotions of this girl and how they help steer this girl through life as various life events impact her. The big impact was how she is effected and deals with a move from Minnesota to San Francisco and the challenges she faces. As all that happens the personified internal emotions try to maintain control. While much of the story is sad, it is also very touching and honest. There are plenty of comedic moments, energetic moments and adventures. This movie was very well thought out, smart and clever with colorful and vibrant animations.","

My children (10g,10g, 9b, & 6b) and I watched this movie and it was the most depressing children's movie ever. It seemed to go on and on. I asked each child what they thought of the movie and they all said it was either boring or depressing and not entertaining. It depended on their age and whether they understood the content. The movie was just dark! I truly looked forward to watching this with my children after seeing the trailers, but this movie was a real disappointment. I can't believe the abundance of positive reviews, unless they were from college kids pursuing psych majors.","

"INSIDE OUT","SpoodermanDerp","13 February 2019","""Inside Out"" is directed by Pete Docter, starring Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith marking Pixar's 15th feature. Right off the bat, this film is imaginative and creative. The concept is, of course, original and it isn't a surprise since Pixar has some great story boards. However, what makes this film special is that, even with it's creative concept and premise, if you simmer it down, it really is just a simple and heartfelt story. It's about an 11 year old girl who loses her core memories and Joy and Sadness in the process. Now they have to get back before she does anything stupid or lose herself, but as usual it becomes a fun adventure that still plays with our heart strings. The first half of this film was bent on introducing the concept and the imaginative world of what goes on in our brain. For some people, it felt tedious, and granted, it does feel a little bit like that in some few parts of the first half, but nonetheless it was understandable considering they had to introduce a whole new world which was inside our heads and they did a pretty great job at doing that when the film progressed. Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith were both great in their respective roles as Joy and Sadness. Seeing how these two different emotions begin to mix up and play along together was a great idea, seeing how obvious having these two emotions together will result in great chemistry and entertainment. The way each and every emotion/character was handled differently and that worked for the film. Another great aspect of the film was that it was relatable. Riley's character was simple, yet she was relatable to children nowadays and reminded the more older audience how they were when they were younger. Moving on, the animation in this film is spectacular. Pixar's previous film ""Monster's University"" had such a rather realistic rendering of the characters and the surroundings, however Pixar takes it up a notch and the animation style improves furthermore in this film. The surroundings looked much more vibrant and colorful, each character design had a special and unforgettable feature to it. Pixar once again creates a beautiful and transcendent world to ponder on.As for the story, it's one of the simplest, yet creative stories Pixar has ever done. In it's close 1 hour and 30 minute run time, the film is a straightforward adventure. Joy and Sadness need to get back her Core Memories before Riley ends up destroying her life and her mind as a whole. That's where the story kicks in and some ups and downs are made. When you think about it (pun intended), it's really just a story of an 11 year old girl coping with her problems and because of that simplicity and with great execution from Pixar, we got one of the most heartwarming, touching, moving and poignant film they've ever made. If you simmer it down, this film isn't about some convoluted story about Monsters or Cars or Superheroes, it's a simple story about emotions and family, nothing more and nothing less. That's the beauty of this film. Even if it were just a simple film with a simple story, it did not fail in touching our hearts like any other Pixar film bringing us to near tears, if not, into full tears. It was already a given that this film would get our emotions running, because it's a film about emotions. But even if it were a film about emotions, I have to say, it surprised me to find out that a simple story like this could get you to clench your heart and nearly cry. Even if for some people that don't cry in this film, it's impossible not to relate and feel your heart be warmed when watching this film. At the end of the day, this was a great comeback for Pixar and it shows that even after 20 years, they still don't fail to create original and intriguing worlds and touch our hearts at the same time.+Creative concept and premise, +All around fun adventure, +Joy and Sadness, +Spectacular Animation, +Unique characters and surroundings, +A simple, yet touching story at it's core.Verdict: 9.3/10","

"INSIDE OUT","Icedooitle","7 April 2011","Of Pixar's 15 films there has been an unspoken promise made before you go to the theater, you will see something magical. If you have ever felt disappointed leaving a Pixar film it is usually because you had an expectation of greatness and had to settle for ""good."" Mind you, even ""good"" is a rare feat when heading to the theater. Inside Out, Pixar's latest venture, achieves greatness in a similar way to Wall-E, a high compliment. While maintaining a child friendly and beautiful atmosphere, there is a very dark undertone that children may not fully understand but will undoubtedly feel.When Riley Anderson is forced to move from Minnesota to California with her family, a very familiar plot is set in motion. A child has to adapt to change at an uncomfortable pace, but will learn that the difficulty and discomfort is part of what makes an adventure an adventure. This usually happens when a wise or eccentric character provides the protagonist with some profound lesson that will come in handy to overcome the antagonist in the foreign environment. This is nothing like Inside Out. I might even argue that this film is without an antagonist. The way this story unfolds is something like Inception for children. This story is substantially easier to follow, but equally deep in possibilities and structure.The other side of this story is set in the mind of Riley. Her emotions take on their own physical presence in a mental control center. These emotions are Joy (Amy Poheler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Fear (Bill Hader), And Disgust (Mindy Kailing). From birth, Riley's life experiences are monitored and assigned a feeling by these characters. This is less a battle for control and more of a coworker dynamic, attempting to keep the brain power plant operating smoothly. The emotions function as a unit the same as countless other creatures that do the grunt-work of maintaining Riley's memories and her mental labyrinth of storage to organize them. The most compelling physical representations of Riley's mind take form in her core memories. All of these constructs are unique to her, as I doubt that everyone's core memories have a 25% section devoted to hockey. The darkest undertone in this film is just what is at stake in the conflict. Other Pixar features may have life and death hanging in the balance, Inside Out holds an 11 year-old girl's personal identity and sanity over oblivion, literally! There are moments when the dark possibilities seem a little trivialized by the obligatory cuteness of the animated mind, but it does little rob adult viewers from imagining some truly heavy weight implications.This may not be the best Pixar adventure. The voice cast is well chosen and ceaselessly entertaining, but the balance between the inside and out favored the inside a little too frequently. In hindsight this is a petty criticism, but the film is still in the company of some of the most monumental achievements in animation, holding its own.On a side note, because this is a Pixar feature it is preceded by an animated short. This may be the best one yet. It would be criminal to spoil anything, so go in fresh and be delighted.","

You couldn't connect with the main girl because she didn't even feel like a character in the movie. The emotions acted the same every time and never changed.The story was the most predictable thing I have ever watched. In the first 30 minutes you know exactly what is going to happen throughout. The story dragged near the end and left me just wanting the movie to end already. Not to mention this movie rehashes every theme and story element done in other the other Pixar movies, but not as well.This movie is made for kids, yes. That does not make it good. It was borderline okay and suffered from many problems, better luck to Pixar next time, please make a good movie again.","

If I can summarize the film in one word, it would be AWESOME!I loved everything about this film. The animation was great, the characters were original, the script was sensational. I loved the idea of the Islands of Personality, and the Dream Productions. The film makes one remember fragments from one's own life, long forgotten, and rekindle those wonderful memories. It really makes you dig deep into your memories. Interestingly enough, it also shows the importance of being sad sometimes. Loved this!!","

"INSIDE OUT","mirceamic-316-221061","7 February 2017","Before I went to see the movie, I heard (almost) everywhere that this is one of the best movie from Pixar, with an original idea. Hasn't anybody heard about Herman's Head? It's the same concept, but cleverer (in my opinion).Let's get to this movie:* my biggest problem is with the introduction of characters (and places); the only characters that have some introduction are the 5 emotions. From the command center everything seems to be automated, without any other help/character, but wait, there are some workers that decide which memory gets kept an which forgotten, other workers that build and maintain Fantasy Land, an imaginary friend that just roams through the memory ... repository, a TV studio (dream makers), a jail, memory eraser ...* Sadness seems to be such a weak character that doesn't account for her actions, you have to make some connections with Riley's situation in order to (somehow) account for her actions (I still don't see a reason for her actions). It's like she's not in control of her actions. I would say that sadness is, sometimes, a stronger emotion than joy, I never saw that in this movie* Joy seems to be a strong character. After 12 years of controlling Riley, all of a sudden she looses control to Sadness who, as I said, seems a weak character. * there is a lot of focus on the pit where memories are forgotten ""everything that falls there disappears forever"". Then Joy manages to fall there. Of course she escapes, she's a main character and this is a Disney movie * the islands are lost way to easy, there is no trace of them in the ""pit"", at the end they reappear bigger and better * the only thing that they got it right (in my opinion) is the fact that dreams are mainly events from the previous day then fears and desires.I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, especially to kids.The only reason I gave it more than one star is because of Pixar's animation. Disney's story ruined the end product.","

The movie is a reflection of a society whose kids (and parents) are medicated and going to endless therapy. Do NOT take children to this movie! Walt Disney is surely rolling in his grave watching this tripe! Compare Snow White and Cinderella to this thing! Eh gad. Disney should fire whoever created this movie and somehow try to rediscover its roots--producing wholesome non-psychotic movies. Worst kids movie I've seen since the last minions move, which was likewise offensive and mindless. Why child needs to know about subconscious, nightmares, and scary clowns? What happened to Dumbo, and the long legacy of Disney classic? Inside Out is a movie with little socially redeeming value.","

A friend of mine is a psychiatrist, he found it relevant to his 10 year old son and young people in general. He picked up a psychiatric journal that 'does not review movies' but there it was... Inside Out. If there was an 11 this would be a 12. How great was Bing Bong, part cat, cotton candy and dolphin. Lol. This movie brought to life a child's brain - something wonderful and complex. The animation was great, the voices were great but the script was out of this world. Who knew how much fun the visualization of the angst of an 11 year old could be?!? (I mean that in the nicest way.) If you ever tried to picture what goes on in young heads, well, try no more. Inside Out is not for little children, I would say 11/12 and up. I hope to see some Oscar action for Inside Out but hope most of all for as many as possible to see it, learn from it and enjoy it.","

"INSIDE OUT","stephen-whipp","19 January 2011","I honestly do not know how this film is being given ratings of 10. This is an example of a film which didn't know what it wanted to be. Firstly what is the target audience? The style of animation is clearly aimed at children, but the content simply is not. To make any sort of sense out of the unfocused storyline you need an adults understanding of the underlying material, which is hopelessly dumbed down, to the point of actually being wrong anyway. You also need a reasonable degree of empathy, or to have experienced such feelings, something younger children typically do not haveThen there is the question of who is the main character, Joy or Riley? Because what you have are 2 simultaneous plot lines (such that they are), linked through metaphor only, blurred by the failed attempt to give the emotions separate personalitiesRatings of 1 are overly harsh in my opinion, there are far worse films, but once you start thinking about it, it just isn't great.","

Plus, they had to think of how they're going to draw and make it for kids. There was WAY too much going on in this movie and because of that you can't grasp the feeling of it. One scene would be about 5 minutes long and then BAM! you're onto the next one. Solving problems after problems very quickly. The movie wasn't that great. It was more of a drag movie than anything. The characters were awful mainly because they all looked the same in everyone's head. Jokes were typical... Wasn't that funny either, I didn't laugh much. Plus it's the ""ugh, that character annoys me so much."" type of movie.","

"INSIDE OUT","Nebzyl","11 January 2011","Nothing in the world is as powerful as emotions. Whatever we do, we do because we have emotions, either that be joy, sadness, fear, disgust or anger. These emotions are the key driving forces of our brain; our brains are controlled by them. Without one, the others can't continue on properly.This simple thing about ourselves is portrayed very well in the movie by Pete Docter; it was quite emotional. The concept behind the movie touched my heart. It brought back the memories of my childhood. It reminded me how I used to think/feel as a child. I can't get them back now, but to some extent, this movie does the job. I'm a child once again. I can feel such strong emotions that make me laugh, or cry. The last time I felt the same was while watching 'Toy Story 3'. 'Inside Out' is simply one of the brilliant animated features by Pixar.I waited a long time for this movie to be released. I expected it to be good one when I saw the trailer. However, it exceeded my expectations. It was quite heart touching that I couldn't resist myself giving this movie a 10 star. It's an excellent movie with a brilliant concept.","

Always. When he falls off and into the bad, fading memories, his beady eyes blinking. It always gets me. I'm the only one who cries, but I don't care. It gets me. Inside Out brings back so many childhood memories, of our joyful times and our sad times this story says that even sad moments and memories can be okay, because they help us grow stronger. And imagination should never leave us and that we should hold on to as many memories as we can.","

"INSIDE OUT","atlasmb","12 December 2019","Obviously ""Inside Out"" is not for everyone. Just look at the volume of negative reviews on IMDb. I must agree that this film is meant more for adults than children. The concepts are too sophisticated or abstract. But that is not a bad thing.I enjoyed this film very much. It must be recognized that undertaking this film was ambitious and risky. Ambitious because it could not have been easy to conceptualize characters that represent emotions and the ""world"" they occupy. Risky, because the very concept of the film might not have attracted many viewers. Clearly they were trading on the stellar reputation that Pixar enjoys. Frankly, I was concerned that the film might have many hidden/subliminal messages about gender, societal roles, etc. But it does not. The focus of the film is enjoyment.One reviewer criticized the film's implication that we all are controlled by our emotions (and therefore do not have free will). I understand the concern, but there are other parts of the brain that control other operations, including motor skills, reasoning, etc. The film's depiction of memories shows how they affect our interactions with our environment. They enable us to learn (a process that involves evaluation and reason), but they are ""colored"" by associated emotions. The internal world of ""Inside Out"", where the emotions and other characters live and interact, is a triumph of imagination. They have mapped an environment where internal workings of the human brain reflect our knowledge of its operations with consistency. At the same time, it's a fun world which allows for an enjoyable storyline, though there are moments of suspense and sadness. In the past, Pixar has made us cry for the fate of toys and insects; now they have done it for emotions and memories.Speaking of touching moments...how about that dedication at the end of the credits: ""This film is dedicated to our kids. Please don't grow up. Ever.""","

Most the moms and dads were playing games on their phones whilst the kids weren't really paying attention to the what was going on in the film. It's a shame really cos I saw reviews by parents complaining that this film ain't for kids. I think it's a great conversation piece to have with your kids after the film and explain bits to them about sadness and happiness needing each other etc. There is a strong message there and it sucks that some parents probably more concerned about slating a film rather than exploring the opportunity to engage with their kids about the values in the story etc.I love this film and i think it's Pixar's best film in years easily one of the top films of all time.","

The whole thing felt average and I was wondering if the movie was trying too hard to make people cry. It's hard to explain, but basically it felt more forced than usual.Some of the jokes were a bit hit and miss for me, and as each character is stuck to one trait pretty much the whole time, the jokes become repetitive. I thought Joy was one of the weakest protagonists we've had from Pixar since Brave, and Riley felt like a robot to me so I never really cared about her, unfortunately.It's their most gimmicky movie as well. They go through different parts of the brain just to hope people will be visually pleased enough to look past the weak script and characters. Pixar has been a bit shaky the last three times, as anything not a sequel seems to get an undeserved boatload of praise. It was average at best, but seeing people put it as the best Pixar movie, is utterly baffling to me.6/10","

The way the whole childhood is represented is something we don't see quite a lot and the way I mean the true way things that we do in our life and their consequences both for a parent and a child is shown are so great that it will hit you right in the brains and your heart.I know I can write a whole Novel praising this Movie but I don't wana spoil it.So DEFINITELY WATCH IT.It's an Experience of a lifetime.Classic.

I saw this 11 months ago when I was at a tech school for a month. It was my first time away from home and I was very emotional. Many movies I saw helped me for a short while, but none of them did that more than this.Our main character, Riley, has 5 emotions in her head: Joy, Anger, Fear, Disgust, and most importantly, Sadness. They all struggle with each other when Riley has to move away to a new home.I am surprised to see 57 current reviews giving this 1 star. Many claim it's boring. Compared to what? Most kid movies are silly-take that Emoji Movie that came out. I did not see it, but it looked pretty dumb and worthless.Some have said that it's too complex. Perhaps I should have mentioned this earlier, but this may be best for older audiences, like The Hunchback of Notre Dame. It's a movie that older audiences can connect with more. This isn't exactly for toddlers, but grade schoolers and up should see this.I cannot think of another Pixar film I would want to give more in-depth praise to. I would love to see more animated features like this. Our society needs it.Inside Out is not just a great animated movie but one of the best movies I have seen in recent years.

"INSIDE OUT","cainefh","28 April 2011","***SPOILER ALERT***As always I had high expectations for this movie, since it's a Pixar movie. But for the first time ever, I was pretty disappointed. The movie is so predictable, and the characters lack any depth. Now I know they are made to very one-dimensional, since it fits the story, but usually, it's only one maybe two characters that lacks any depth. This time I think they were all pretty uninteresting.Pixar is usually able to make a movie that has something for all age groups. Toystory for instance. If you watch it at 6, you are going to have a hole other experiences, if you watch it again at age 18 and again at 30 etc.. The main character is a young girl, and it revolves around her, and of course makes it hard to make any really good grown up jokes, since they have to be careful, because of her age. But the people in her head is a reflection of her, and since she is supposed to be a young girl, they are pretty one-sided too. But even the grown ups, ""headpeople"" are very one-dimensional and you don't really worry or care about any of them at any point.It completely ruins the possibilities to write an immersive story, at least if you are above 18 years old, you'd probably have a hard time relating or at least find them a bit interesting. So if you are 18 and above, I don't think you'll like it. Will children like it than? Honestly no, I don't think so. I think the story is too complicated for really young children, but the visuals are nice as always, you just expect more, than a 1980s demo, from Pixar. The jokes are old and you see them coming from a mile away. Ofc the dad, thinks about sports at dinner table and pays no attention to the conversation, he would have too. It's just like they picked the easy solution, every time in this movie and really didn't give it much thought. Maybe it's just Pixar that starts repeating themselves and it really shows in this movie, it was like I kinda had seen it all before in another Pixar movie.","

"INSIDE OUT","Filvies144","19 April 2019","Lately, Pixar hasn't created anything considered perfect since Toy story 3. Cars 2 and Monsters university weren't great and didn't live up to others. But now we have this film, which is one of two Pixar films this year.When I saw this film, there was a theatrical short called ""Lava"". The short was actually awful, un-entertaining, and was like a romance music video. I give that one a 2/10.OK, on to Inside out. The film was fun, funny, and even a little complicated like the Toy story films. Before this film was released, I really doubted this film, thinking the concept would be unappealing and the writing might not be good. But this bashed my low expectations. I liked the adventure in this film because the backgrounds were excellent and made me feel like I was either in San Francisco or inside Riley's brain. The animation also made the emotions look cute, but the thing about this film is, like other Pixar films, it starred human characters in it, but the animation just creates good looking humans because its not always a good idea t make your animated film look as real as possible like ""The Polar express"". As for the characters, the emotions are sometimes funny and a little lovable. One problem is that I feel like the emotions have emotions of their own. Like there are scenes where Sadness and Anger smile like they're happy. That makes no sense since they're supposed to feel their own emotion since Joy is called Joy for example.This film doesn't have a good theatrical short, but it is still great movie that makes up for Pixar's previous disappointments (Cars 2, anyone?), and manages to blow away doubts. I hope Pixar continues this comeback with the Good dinosaur this Fall. Kinda hard to believe that Pixar would release 2 films in one year when during previous years it would be one at a time. Update July 26: When I created this review 3 weeks ago, I noticed a lot of negative reviews even though it has a 8.7 average rating. Its sad to see it have all this undeserved hate. At least tons of others have the critics point of view for this film. Plus, all this hate is coming from people who thought it was ""sad"". Sure they do have an opinion but this movie is still clever even when some parts like Bing bongs entire storyline is sad. If you watch the first 10 minutes of Up, you may understand that sad is sometimes sad in a good way. I can't wait for its home release then I can watch it over and over again.Update: This stupid troll is still going. Its down to a a8.4! WHY?Anyway, I'd like to thank the people who gave this at least a 7/10. Its beautiful and heartwarming and deserves to be in any animation hall of fame.

Everyone thinks kids should be these energetic beings who are only seeing the glass half full. While sometimes this is true other times they feel down and can't explain why. Seeing this film and showing them it's normal and not unusual is extremely important. I recommend everyone watch this.","

"INSIDE OUT","lidster_ma","6 May 2019","I love Pixar films and was eagerly anticipating the release and viewing of inside out after all the rave reviews. How disappointed were both myself and my girlfriend. For first time ever in our lives we walked out of a cinema part way through a film. What a load of psychobabble drivel! The concept had potential but boy did they ruin it in their delivery. Firstly no way could could non Mensa affiliated kids be expected to understand the language inside the head. Secondly no sane adult would buy the lack of emotions on offer to control a humans psyche and the crude attempts to convey personal and interpersonal interactions. But putting all of that aside it was just plain boring. Please please do not put yourselves or your children through this pointless unentertaining experience.","

These voices are embodied in front of us as part of a comedic and dramatic adventure. The film deals with the inner emotional turmoil experienced by the eleven-year-old child Riley; Where her life is turned upside down because her family is forced to move to another city, and then move away from her friends and all the things she loves from places, things, activities and memories. These feelings are embodied in the interaction between five main characters who live inside Riley's mind and lead her daily life: ""joy"", ""sadness"", ""anger"", ""fear"" and ""disgust.""

"INSIDE OUT","sweetsmile-90907","9 December 2011","There are a few reasons why I consider this movie terrible and why I find it so horrifying that it's current rating is 8.5 when Spirited Away--one of the best animated movies ever created--is sitting at 8.6. Long story short, the characters were for the most part difficult to like. Joy was thoughtlessly cruel and condescending to Sadness and the other emotions, and Riley--the girl we're all supposed to love and find easy to relate to--was extremely obnoxious/egocentric and rubbed me the wrong way for the entire movie. I resented the stereotypes that were used and found them more than a little insulting. For example, Riley has an ""imaginary boyfriend"" at the age of 12. I don't know about you people, but I find this extremely concerning. 12 year old girls should NOT be thinking that they should have boyfriends at their age--while it may start out innocent, it can unconsciously encourage premature sexual thoughts and activity, which is EXTREMELY unhealthy and dangerous at their age. Also, I don't personally know any girls (including myself) who ACTUALLY had imaginary boyfriends. Ever. Let alone at 12! And don't even get me started on the imaginary friend Bing-Bong. BING-BONG! That's actually his name! I found him irritating and, frankly, disturbing. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm sure young children will LOVE this movie, and maybe some parents and teenagers as well. However, on the whole, I would NOT consider it up to par with other Disney Pixar movies. It was compared to ""UP"" for Pete's sake--the movie that had EVERYONE crying within the first 10 minutes! It was an enormous let- down for me, especially since all the raving had really caused me to build it up, which made it all the more disappointing. Therefore, watch at your own peril. Consider yourself warned.","

"INSIDE OUT","kushkandi","14 December 2011","I saw this movie a couple months ago and had to pause it multiple times to get through it..First of all, I'm really enjoying Disney/Pixar's esoteric films. I LOVED SOUL!!!However, there was a specific reason that made me want to watch Inside Out - I am an adult on the autism spectrum (ASD) and Inside Out is commonly brought up, for being a good movie for kids with autism to better understand facial expressions (although it's a a little more complex than smile = happy and frown = sad)..I watched this with my husband, and I understand this movie in itself, isn't a film meant for those in the autism community - the film isn't even about ASD. However, it got a lot of positive feedback from parents in the autism community; but I can honestly say from an adult perspective with ASD, I can honestly say that film really triggered my ASD.There are constant switch-ups and the whole movie is constantly shifting from one thing to another.. I can't explain it, but if you've seen the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about. The constant switch-ups that are consistent throughout the film made the film unbearable for me.Watching this film the way it was executed - I became very stressed, irritable and anxious throughout the film; many times having to look away and take breaks.I really don't know how someone with ASD can watch this and not have a negative physical/mental response.I understand being on the spectrum, I may have a stronger reaction to this sorta thing but I watched this with my husband who is not on the spectrum, and the movie was strongly bothering him equally, if not even more. We both needed breaks and to look away.They definitely get points for the film though, I think it's a great idea, and was an alright story; on paper, it sounds like a movie I'd enjoy and I'm glad it was made. However, it was poorly executed IMO, and if they could have paced it differently, it would be easier to watch.","

"INSIDE OUT","bartonj2410","20 February 2022","For the past twenty years, Pixar have taken us on an emotional ride through the eyes of; toys, bugs, monsters, fish, superheroes, cars, a rat, a robot, an elderly man and a brave young princess. This year though, they may have their most emotional picture yet in the form of Inside Out and this time, it's all about our emotions showing emotion.When young Riley and her family move from their quiet midwest life to the hustle and bustle of San Francisco, Riley's emotions; Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Anger (Lewis Black) go into overdrive.Together they have to work to make sure Riley adjusts to life in a new city, house and school.As always with Pixar, there is much more to their films than first meets the eye. The story may sound very basic however, when you watch Inside Out, one of the most impressive things about it is the sheer amount of imagination that has gone into making it such a special film.The world that the animators have created inside the mind of a child is one of Pixar's best pieces of work yet and everything single one of the emotions fills it with their unique personality. There is some good voice work provided by the likes of Poehler, Smith and Black but it does feel that both Kaling and Hader are a little underused however, not enough to make their characters pointless. The script is full of brilliant comedic moments, allowing Black's Anger to steal most of the scenes, and touching scenes that have Joy, Fear, Disgust and Anger wondering what the purpose of Sadness really is.It is such themes as this and the script that makes Inside Out arguably Pixar's most accessible animation to both adults and children. If you thought the final scene in Toy Story 3 or the opening to Up tugged at the heartstrings, wait until you see Inside Out.If Inside Out is one thing, it is undeniable proof that Pixar remain the leading animation studio in Hollywood. A title they have been holding now for the past twenty years.","

It helps that the voice casting was perfect too.
Some little things: the father was considered dumb by the mother, while she's never seen in any bad light, giving the impression of a perfect woman and a dumb man, for no real reason. Quite insignificant, by the way. Another: it played the stereotypes with the ""emotions"" in the protagonist head, and the fact that sadness was fat may be a little... well, questionable.

It looks like a movie for preschoolers, but the story definitely isn't. It should be rated PG-8 or higher. It's odd that the rare Disney movie where the child isn't an orphan would be even more down-beat. SPOILER: Two ""characters"" actually do sacrificial suicides. Yipes!?!?! On the positive side, the underlying intellectual concept is managed pretty well, and adults may find it ""worthy,"" and there are some laughs. However, the story is slow, mostly action-less, and nearly empty of suspense or thrills. Worst of all, the color scheme and design are too bland; the locations are simplistic and almost never beautiful.Still, the box office on this film proves the makers right: attract adults; kids will go to anything animated.","

Samuel Ullman While the emotions of a pre-adolescent girl, Riley (voice of Kaitlyn Dias), in Inside Out are depicted in a Star-Trek like control room as real characters, Joy (Amy Poehler) is the Captain Kirk, the major influence in Riley's life so far and at the helm with other players Fear, Sadness, Disgust, and a plethora of memory pods. Riley's had a happy Minnesota life so far with ice hockey and hiking and a much simpler life than now faces her in the family's move to San Francisco.The depiction of these raucous emotions is sheer Pixar genius, a human menagerie of inner players, making sense of the conflicting feelings of a young person, and all of us for that matter. The visuals are stunning, as colorful as has been seen in any other animation, and the big-eyed 'toon characters have distinct personalities developed in a short time.Besides the anthropomorphic emoticons, I am most impressed by the emphasis on memory in fashioning a life. My fear is losing that great gift, for memories form the core of satisfaction with my life, a hedge against mortality if you will. Inside Out emphasizes the primacy of those memories while it also frames the inside fight around the necessity for the conflicting emotions, even sadness as a major player in mental health.Well, it is Pixar after all with its brilliant combination of fun and intelligence, a work of art that indulges the physical and cerebral. All this in an animation—who would have thought except that Saturday cartoons at my local theater helped me shape a loving attitude toward cinema and a career in film criticism? That's my Joy.","

"INSIDE OUT","lasttimeisaw","24 April 2011","Pixar's latest offer is an absolutely worthwhile adventure for adults and teenagers alike (certainly not for toddlers), makes further efforts to forever change the existential territory of animation feature, it is our generation's great blessing to have Pixar continuously giving life to such master-class animations, which defy the temptation of huge profits from low- hanging fruits, as DESPICABLE ME series and its spin-off THE MINIONS (2015) unblushingly cashes in on.Anthropomorphising our emotions into five singular entities, Joy (Poehler), Sadness (Smith), Disgust (Kaling), Fear (Hader) and Anger (Black), which reign over every single individual's daily life (not just humans, critters like cats and dogs have them too), might sound a bit dumbed-down on paper, clearly we all aware that we have much more important emotions other than this major five (which is my only hiccup with the setting, especially for adults, more emotions need to be discovered as we grow up, such as pride, shame, jealousy, honesty, guilty etc.), but five is sufficient enough for our protagonist Riley (Dias), a 11-year- old girl whose main emotion is Joy, but now she is experiencing a difficult time when her family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco.Anyway, this is only a hindsight, the film itself is bursting with whimsical and eye-opening pizazz and it magically constructs a visual and logical splendour of how our brain is working, from the headquarter where 5 emotions work, to the personality islands which created by core memories, to a long term memory labyrinth where memory balls are stalled and constantly cleansed with a train of thoughts doing all the transportation in-between. Then the more innovative cerebral designs, such as the abstract thought zone, where three- dimensional figure reduces to one-dimensional and bespeaks the immaturity and instability of Riley's young brain (a great visual deviation); the dream production, imitates a hectic film crew to re-enact the daily happenings with farcical verisimilitude for Riley's dreamland; in the subconscious world lies our worst nightmares, for Riley, it could be a walking broccoli or a giant clown and finally, the memory dump, where everything will vanish from Riley's memory forever, also a poignant moment occurs as we say goodbye to Riley's imaginary friend Bing Bong (Kind), whose is hoping for reconnect with Riley, but in reality, they only descend to oblivion when we grow up. All the ingenuity is convincingly relatable for everyone, and tailor-made with what Riley undergoes in her life, who loses her important personality islands one by one, after Joy and Sadness incidentally are sucked out of the headquarter through the transporting tube when Joy is busy at keeping the blue Sadness at bay from the ""happy"" memory balls. The remaining trio emotions make a great mess while Joy is intent on getting back until she realises she may not be the key emotion to implement the overhaul and save Riley from her impractical running-away plan. The two parallel worlds are perfectly meshed together, the cause-and-effect interactions are brilliantly carried out thanks to a rigorous script sprinkled with grade A humour and sincere emotional projection. And the centre message it inculcates is extremely edifying, we should embrace all the emotions, especially do not underestimate the power of sadness, through sadness, one can face the true feelings and that's what makes us a qualified human being. I watched the picture in its 3D format, and it is preceded by a 7-minutes short LAVA, directed by James Ford Murphy, a charming love story about two lonely volcanoes with inspiring artistry. One must give kudos to the team headed by Peter Doctor, the mastermind behind MONSTERS, INC. (2001, 8/10) and UP (2009, 9/10). And as long as I live, I promise, my Pixar island will never be thrown into the memory dump, INSIDE OUT is my current best film of 2015 and if any this year's upcoming films can excel it, 2015 will be a great year of cinema in my book!","

"INSIDE OUT","meeza","31 March 2011","Disney Pixar's ""Inside Out"" is one movie that will stay in my ""cinematic joy"" memory bank for a long time. This creative gem focuses on a tween named Riley who moves from Minnesota to San Francisco with her family. Writer-Directors Pete Doctor and Ronnie Del Carmen develop this fascinating film by focusing on the mental emotions inside Riley by developing characters of her emotions; which include Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust. Not to sound like a Debbie Downer, but my personal cerebral character of the picture was Sadness; actress Phyllis Smith did a stellar vocal performance as Sadness, which ironically brought me much joy in laughter. Anyways, back to the narrative. When things go wrong inside Riley's brain when Joy is jumped out from Riley's memory headquarters, Riley becomes disillusioned about her new life in San Francisco and finds no joy in it. Joy, alongside Sadness, must find their way back to Riley's Cerebral Headquarters before she loses all emotion. Other solid vocal performances came straight outta the mouths of Amy Poehler as Joy, Bill Hader as Fear, and Mindy Kaling as Disgust. ""Inside Out"" is one smart computer-animated flick you should delve inside to and check out. ***** Excellent","

Thought the movie you see Riley have lots of emotions on moving to a different city, school, and many more things. The voice acting is great by everyone, Amy Pohler does a great job as joy and Lewis Black as Anger is just amazing casting.

And we especially wondered how it could have been such a hit with respected critics and more importantly, young children. Sadly, we were completely bored. The animation is super-busy as is the dialogue. It's fun to hear the voices of a superstar cast, and some of the ideas are very insightful.

Her emotions are wonderfully brought to life by several anthropomorphic characters who exist in a meticulously designed imaginative world.It is similar in feel to 'Toy Story' as it presents a world that exists alongside everyday life to produce a great story with humour and emotion. Again the Pixar writers cleverly link what a real world character experiences to the adventures of the connected characters.What makes 'Inside Out' distinct, is that a lot of the structures and characters have strong foundations within actual psychological and neurological theory, such as the impact of external factors on adjustment and the formation of memories. The fact that it also shows brief glimpses into the minds of other characters like Riley's mum and dad is a fantastic source of humour.Visually it contains typically colourful, textured and detailed 3D animation that creates a whole new universe to absorb and entertain.All voice performances are excellent, particularly Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Richard Kind, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Mindy Kaling, and Kaitlyn Dias.","

I'm not sure why the film has drawn such ire from some viewers, maybe it's just one of those love/hate movies, or maybe you (or a loved one) have to have gone through a serious struggle to have it resonate.

This movie is about Riley,an 11 year old girl from Minnesota who loves Hockey and lives happily with her mom and dad.But everything falls apart when they move to San Francisco,where she has to deal with a new house,and new school where she needs to make new friends and her emotions Joy,Sadness,Fear,Anger and Disgust guide her through these life changing events.Though,affected by these changes,Sadness makes a few mistakes that end up with her and Joy,into the far reaches of Riley's mind and with only Fear,Anger and Disgust left to the head quarters to guide Riley and to try and maintain positive thinking. First off to begin with,the emotions and their voice cast in this movie is all around perfect.Starting with Joy,voiced by Amy Poehler,Fear by Bill Hader,Disgust by Mindy Kaling,Anger by Lewis Black and Sadness by Phyllis Smith.They all do a masterful job in here,giving the right voice ""emotion"" to their emotions. Pete Docter is the director of this movie,he previously directed Monsters Inc,which I truly love,and Up,which is my all time favorite animated movie.This guy is a genius at this.He has mastered the art of the animation so well now that everything he does,its perfect. I really liked the way the world inside the mind was presented.I think they found new and interesting ways to show that to us and to impress us.The animation is gorgeous as every other Pixar movie ever,but what makes this movie great,it is the story,that its special and amazing.It is also very funny and will most certainly brings tears of joy (literally) to those who watch it. Kids should see this movie,because they will have fun and marvel at the animation,and laugh at the jokes in it.They will also learn about emotions and about what makes us human as a whole.But quiet frankly,in my opinion this movie is targeted more to adults,because of its thematic and interesting plot and I am pretty sure that adults will get the best of this movie,which is a weird thing to say about an animation,but then again,this is Pixar and you can except anything from these miracle workers. I honestly cried like 3 times in this movie,which is to be expected from this director,after that truly sad and masterpiece of a movie that he made before this,Up,and from what I heard,a lot of people cried also which is an astonishing achievement for the crew. I read an article on how Psychiatrists around the world are really loving this movie,which can clearly tell you just how amazing and well thought Inside Out is.They are saying that kids should definitely see this movie and that it can teach them a lot about emotions which is a hard thematic discussion to have for adults with their children. This is a stunning and original movie,also by far the best Pixar movie since Toy Story 3,and in my opinion,in Top 3 of all time Pixar movies.Everyone should watch this movie and I hope that it gets nominated for Best Picture,as Pixar's two earlier movies (Up and Toy Story 3).","

It's so fresh! It's so innovative. It's like they've combined all of their experiences to create THIS! ""Inside Out"" has gathered the ""Stresses of Marlin Finding his Nemo"", ""Colorful World of Toy Story"", ""The Act of True Love of Frozen"", ""The Gradual Comprehension of the Multi-Dimensional World of Monsters Company"" and finally the ""Cartoonish Depicted Reality of Monsters University"" and above all this the ""Beauty of Pledge and Promise of Up"" It's like a patchwork doll with a new clothing which looks brand new but carries the precious roots and origins within itself. They finally came up with an idea that surpasses the mostly praised ""Toy Story"". It reminded me of the most beautiful movie of my life ""Wall-E"", it really did after 7 years! Thank you Pixar!

"INSIDE OUT","proud_luddite","28 November 2010","In this animated film, the mind of an eleven-year old American girl is a universe unto itself. Five characters represent primary emotions occasionally battling for dominance. The world that surrounds them includes a mega-factory like setting that represents long-term memory.To call ""Inside Out"" clever is a great understatement. It shows the same great creativity and imagination that made the ""Toy Story"" movies such a pleasure to watch. While the girl's outer world has difficult challenges, the inner world (as depicted on screen) is even more chaotic while appearing as an adventure.The film succeeds in its unusual use of psychology as the device to drive its plot. It even manages to create genuine sadness when some of the girl's early childhood memories disappear. And speaking of psychology, the story has a gentle jab against what could be called ""the tyranny of positive thinking"".The good humour in this movie adds to its entertainment value while its intelligence shines through as well thanks to a clever story by Pete Docter (the director), Meg LeFauve, and Josh Cooley.","

"INSIDE OUT","bonekeep","4 December 2013","It's tempting to name the Oscar winner in Animated Feature Film for this year (2015) already, because Inside Out is going to be tough to beat! From the same writer/director, Pete Docter of Pixar classics such as Toy Story (all of them), Monster's Inc, and Up, Inside Out figured to be another great one and surely delivered. The story is of a girl named Riley who's emotions help guide her from birth to the point at which her life is uprooted by a move away from her home town. Those emotions - joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and anger - are terrifically voiced by the likes of Amy Poehler (SNL), Phyllis Smith (The Office), Bill Hader (SNL), Mindy Kaling (The Office), and Lewis Black (Stand-up comic). The animation is glorious, and I feel like I need to see this movie a half dozen more times to be able to take it all in. Add to that an interesting and convincingly complex story line that conceptualizes memories, dreams, the sub conscience, and such in very clever ways. I think the story itself is too complicated for a younger audience, but like many Pixar films, part of the magic is being able to entertain audiences of all levels, even when the story is geared for a more mature audience (think WALL-E, which Pete Docter also wrote). This film doesn't quite have the emotional impact or laughs of a Monster's, Inc., or Toy Story 3 (my personal favorite), but it surely has its tender moments with plenty of funny stuff. That, along with a lively, clever plot and eye candy galore, makes Inside Out a definite must see.","

"INSIDE OUT","mober1996","4 April 2011","""Inside-Out"" ReviewNow allow me to start by saying this, when I was watching the previews for this film originally, I was saying to myself ""Oh god, another one of these."" I simply had no care, nor any intention of seeing it. BUT then I started hearing the reviews, about how simply amazing it was, and how everyone should take the time to see it. But even then, I was kind of ""Ehhhhh I don't know."" And then, my friend finally convinced me to see it. I didn't know what to expect.Now to wrap all of the ""Oh I was wrong"" and ""I regret thinking what I did of this movie"" and all that crap. Inside-Out is what of the most emotionally beautiful movies I have seen this year. It is a beautiful tale of an adolescent girl coming to terms with childhood depression. Frankly it has some of the best imagery of ANY movie I have ever seen. And let me tell youit gave me some serious feels.One of the greatest approaches to this movie is how we see the emotions/the brain growing and learning as the characters age. From the moment where we are born to the moment where we die, we are constantly learning and adapting as we enter the different stages of our life. The ""Emotions"" as I am going to refer to them as, are learning as the characters grow. Which is a WONDERFUL symbolism for the brain developing.I know that I have dealt with childhood depression, especially throughout my teenage years, and so seeing this simply incredibly imagery of this unfolding into a young girl gave me a sense of immersion. I was able to relate to it. And as I have said, I love it with I can immerse myself in with a scene or character (because I am weird like that).The only problem I really dealt with is that it felt like it was going so quickly in the beginning to encounter the main problem and then it slowed down to a crawl. However, in some ways it felt necessary. Not only for the plot, but for the imagery of how depression feels. Depression makes you feel like the world has stopped. You shut down. And those emotions that have been eating away at you take over and start controlling every decision you make, even involuntarily. So, honestly, I can't give much negativity on the slowness of the movie, because that really is how it was supposed to be.In conclusion, this movie was incredible. It was beautiful, funny, emotional, and really everything it needed to be to get the point across and be a fun movie to watch at the same time. Definitely a movie to go and see for the summerregardless of how late this review has come out. Final Score: 9/10","

(I give it a 3 because it did make me laugh) I can honestly see why people love it, but for me it just made me really annoyed with Sadness. For the majority of the movie I was trying not to scream at the screen. For example....SPOILER....The part when Sadness is touching all of the Memories....WHAT WAS SHE THINKING??? Shes like that one person you work with who is miserable and make everyone else miserable. Like I said there were some parts that I did like, but over all I spent the majority of the movie annoyed with one character. P.S. Please don't let my review sway you from watching it.

"INSIDE OUT","subxerogravity","30 March 2011","There is some well done animation going here that's going to make inside out an instant classic among classics like Finding Nemo and The Incredibles. It was so well crafted this time around, the movement of the 3D images were better than anything I've seen before. It's very colorful (like a child's mind), and the animation give off a scene of action adventure in the movement, very exciting to watch. The story in the animation was well written and showed the importance of all sets of emotions to a healthy growing mind. The movie is about young girl Riley's emotions working together to keep the kid sound during a big change in her life. Someone really did their homework on how the mind works and was able to interpret that to a wide core audience with silly little things like A train that carries your thoughts and a Hollywood studio that produces your dreams and the biggest star of the studio was named Rainbow haired unicorn. The whole thing felt like reading a really good children's book about the effects of a small child moving from the only home she's every known to a new environment. It was so well played out you can't help to cheer. Joy was the main protagonist of the film, but sadness steels the show with her dead pan humor. Fear and anger are two other notable emotions in the film. They also had a short film in the beginning called lava which was really amazing and touching.Absolutely perfect!","

Inside Out can certainly be added to the long list of great Pixar movies.The plot goes on inside the head of Riley who is a happy child enjoying life in the Midwest. The characters who control Riley are Joy, Fear, Sadness, Anger and Disgust. These characters fight for control and the outside world sees the result of this through Riley's emotions and behaviour.The great thing about Pixar movies is that they are always character driven. Unlike so many movies you really care about the characters. I was thoroughly entertained throughout the movie and good to report that there are a few extras in the closing credit sequence.","

I always loved to read about psychology, so when I heard that Disney and Pixar released a movie about the mind I was super excited to watch it. It was even better when I saw the reviews on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. This is a must see for all the family. I almost cried in the end of the movie. I consider this to be an almost perfect movie. The only thing that I think it failed was the Bing Bong storyline. I think it would be nice if Joy made Riley remember about Bing Bong, cause he was kind of forgotten in the end.","

"INSIDE OUT","moonspinner55","11 August 2018","Computer-animated family film from Pixar Animation Studios and released by Disney, about the emotional scramble going on inside the brain of a normal, healthy little girl, is extraordinarily bright and colorful--and yet hyperactive, with overlapping dialogue that rushes by at such a fast clip one might think the sound designers and everyone else involved with the film were feeling the effects of a sugar rush. There's not much to the narrative (trouble-causing Sadness and ringleader Joy have to find their way out of the kid's long-term memory storage), while most of the attention is focused on the child's five basic emotions (the girl, Riley, and her parents rarely come to the fore as actual characters). Kids seem to enjoy the film because it's fluorescent and energetic, like a cereal commercial on television. With so much slapstick and shouting, it could easily compete with a restless child's attention span--and win. ** from ****","

"INSIDE OUT","Jeremy_Urquhart","23 March 2021","After a rough few years post-Toy Story 3, which saw Pixar put out some of their worst (Cars 2) or otherwise decent but not great movies (Brave, Monsters University), 2015 saw them bounce back with Inside Out. While it might not quite live up to the original Toy Story films, or other classics like Ratatouille, Wall-E, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles, it comes really close. Unfortunately, 2015 would also see Pixar release one of their most disappointing and forgettable films in The Good Dinosaur, mere months after Inside Out. And then from 2016 onwards, I don't think anything has been as good as Inside Out, though there's been a few good ones.I'm starting to sound a little too down. Like this movie's protagonist, I should stay more positive. The important thing is that Inside Out's pretty great. It's got very few flaws. Pixar has always been great at making films that provide a range of emotions for viewers young and old, and with this one, they actually made a movie about emotions. And they give those personified emotions their own emotions. Naturally, it's very emotional.Inside Out contains some of Pixar's saddest moments and some of its funniest. Most (but not quite all) of the jokes land. The insight into the mind of a cat - shown in the end credits - is possibly the hardest I've ever laughed at a Pixar movie. But when it comes to delivering bittersweet or sad emotions, I think it delivers 100% of the time. I can't say everyone will feel something watching Inside Out, because I can't read minds (or emotions?) But surely, most will. It simplifies the concept of emotions and mental well-being, sure, but despite that, a great deal of it still rings very true.It might be Pixar's last absolute classic, though I hold out hope they can strike genuine gold again at some point in the future. 20 years on from their first film (and first masterpiece), Toy Story, they showed they've still got it, as an animation studio, and this remains a shining example of what they do right as a collective.","

"INSIDE OUT","gavin6942","7 January 2011","After young Riley is uprooted from her Midwest life and moved to San Francisco, her emotions -- Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness -- conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.As with many popular, successful movies, this one has caused a great deal of response on the Internet. Many people love it, and it currently (January 2016) sits in the Top 100 on IMDb. And, of course, we begin to get a push back with people calling it overrated, over-hyped, and some even saying it is offensive in its depiction of gender and inappropriate for children.The path it has followed through award season has had a similar up and down trajectory. Early on, it was seen as the clear winner of the animation Oscar and even in the running for Best Picture. Gradually slipping, it now seems to be 50/50 for animation (up against ""Anomalisa"") with zero chance of getting anywhere near Best Picture. Sorry, Pixar.As with anything, the reality is never as rosy or as bleak as the Internet would like it to be. ""Inside Out"" may not be Best Picture, but it has a better-than-average chance of landing the animation Oscar. And that is because you rarely get a cartoon that reaches this deep inside its audience. A film about emotions (or lack thereof) that actually makes you feel.This is not a children's movie. The kids will enjoy the bright colors and characters, especially Bing Bong. And there is nothing ""adult"" in terms of violence, nudity or cursing. (There is one subtle reference to the San Francisco homosexual community, but it is not offensive or derogatory.) This may be the darkest Pixar film yet, thematically. Depression, loneliness, alienation. The adults are the ones who will really appreciate this sad story of change and end of innocence.Director Pete Docter, who previously made ""Up"", has set the bar high for himself here if he continues making movies (which, of course, he will). He could even have achieved for himself a place alongside John Lasseter in the hall of great animation directors. He assembled this one just right, down to the voices -- Lewis Black and Phyllis Smith are the very embodiment of the emotions they portray.Although the best animation in recent years remains ""Wreck-It Ralph"", this film clearly has to rank among the finest, giving such movies as ""Ralph"" and ""Toy Story 3"" a run for their money.","

This movie is really good and has a lot of good points to make also. The whole movie wonderfully animated with a great cast of characters that are totally three dimensional. Example? Disgust has a sense of fashion and also has a good sense of taste. The voice work is great also, Lewis Black and Bill Hader have standout roles in the movie. For a movie about emotions, I was on the edge of my seat. The whole movie has islands in her mind crumbling to pieces and you really want Joy and Sadness to get back to headquarters. When Joy falls down into the dump, that really made me gasp. The ending of the movie is totally amazing. I think we can all relate to the ending.Inside Out is definitely the best animated film of the year so far. It also comes with a great short film also called Lava.

I have never been a big fan of animated features because their just cartoons and if I want that I'll watch the ones that air on television that I like. But their is this amazing company called Pixar(maybe you've heard of them). They've given me some of my favorite films not just as a child but as I've gotten older. I'm talking Monsters University and of course Toy Story 3. I cried like a baby in Toy Story 3. I haven't cried so hard in a film since, until now when I saw Pixar's latest film Inside Out. The film is about a child named Riley and the little voices inside her head. First comes Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear and last but not least Anger. Their Riley's emotions, Joy tries to make sure Riley is happy everyday but Sadness keeps getting in the way. When Riley moves Joy tries to start things out positively in Riley's new home but when Sadness touches another Core memory Joy tries to change it back and they both vanish into long term memory. While they have disappeared Fear, Disgust, and Anger try to make Riley happy on her first day of school and until but they weren't made for those types of feelings. Joy and Sadness have to find a way back to headquarters before Riley runs away from home, her personality destroyed and she can no longer feel anything. I loved the performances from the cast, even the one's who were playing Riley, and her parents. You already know when going into this film that the main stars playing the emotions are going to do an amazing job. Their well known stars in a Pixar movie with a good script. The script isn't very formulaic because it plays with the idea of how we use our emotions. It has a worthwhile point of always doing your best to no mater how feel, you can channel both your sadness with happiness, anger with fear, disgust with happiness or in any way. To makes sure that no matter how we feel we can always be happy no mater what situation, because theirs always way to turn something terrible into something good. While watching the film I was crying because I thought about how I use my emotions in the wrong way when it comes to a girl I like or a girl I like that moves, or not fitting with the people I call my friends at church(because I have nothing in common with them because I love films like it's no one's business, play XBOX One, and I'm going to Fl Supercon, and well I still have acne after trying to get rid of it for five years.

The emotions that we have. Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust & Fear (all of whom are voiced here as primary characters), are the emotions that eventually make us who we are. We all have that one imaginary friend, whom we let go when we grow up, we all hit puberty & we all try to understand the present. 'Inside Out' narrates Riley's story with mesmerizing strength & the connectivity I had while the story progressed, left me spell-bound.Pete Docter & Ronnie del Carmenbound's Screenplay is Masterful. The Writing is so real & so imaginative, that I wondered how did they even achieve this near impossible task. Pete Docter's Direction is exemplary & with the recent Oscar-Win for Best Animated Feature, just proves its merit & beyond.'Inside Out' is filled with exceptional vocal performances. Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Lewis Black as Anger, Bill Hader as Fear, Mindy Kaling as Disgust, Kaitlyn Dias as Riley Andersen & Richard Kind as Bing Bong, add extraordinary depth to their respective roles. On the whole, 'Inside Out' is about us & it nails every nuance of whom we are. This one's a Milestone in modern storytelling.","

This isn't a Pixar movie for toddlers, or really anyone under 12, but is much better suited for early to mid teens or really anyone over 12 should find it entertaining. I'm not going to say how unbelievably far past 12 I am but I will say that I found it a hoot.A simple premise that has been given depth and complexity that isn't dumbed down too much for the toddlers.

"INSIDE OUT","goldberry-90-44341","10 December 2017","If there's anything that can be said about this film, it's that it's by far Pixar's most emotional movie to date. Hehehehe...sorry, couldn't resist. But really, I spent an alarming amount of time with a lump in my throat. However, while Pixar's latest film is a fascinating thought experiment, it definitely has its flaws.It's a little bit difficult to decide whether the emotion lies in the movie or in the memories it evokes. I'd imagine it's a completely different experience for a child viewer, a teenager, or a parent, but I suspect the last two appreciate its full weight far more than young children would. It's not that kids won't like the film: to the contrary, it feels like it's designed for younger viewers, unlike Ratatouille or The Incredibles (my two favorite Pixar films.) It's merely that this story is more about the loss of childhood than the celebration of it. This bittersweet feel is similar to that in Toy Story 3.The story is about Riley, an eleven-year-old whose young life has been blissfully happy up until the day her family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco. She had tons of friends, doting parents, a successful hockey career, a never-ending chain of happy memories, symbolized by glowing marbles.These memories are fashioned by her five emotions: Joy (an enthusiastic Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Disgust (Mindy Kaling), Fear (Bill Hader), and Anger (Lewis Black.) Up until this point, Joy has had complete control, but glimpses into the minds of Riley's parents - where Sadness and Anger are the primary fueling emotions - foreshadow that things may be about to change. Joy recognizes the place of Fear, Disgust, and Anger - they keep Riley safe. But Sadness, that most adult of emotions, seems to have no function whatsoever. In a more typical movie, Sadness would have been cast as the villain. But this isn't a typical movie.Once Riley arrives in San Francisco, all of her happiness comes into question. We follow her through the events of the move, her first day at school and trying out for the hockey team. Inside of her head, something has gone terribly wrong, and the emotions have to work double time to get things right. It's clever how the movie uses the emotions - you can almost fool yourself into thinking that what happens to Riley is a consequence of what they do, but in the end, you know that they are an allegory for her mind, not the other way around. But the emotions don't know what the viewer knows must happen: they expect childhood to continue forever, and memories to remain simply happy or sad or angry or fearful or disgusting.The rest of the movie takes place over the space of a few days, as Riley's emotional life crumbles and she has to redefine herself. Looking back, the whole thing is not all that huge a crisis, but it's magnified by the drama of her emotions. It reminds me of Lord of the Flies (bear with me) in that the film does a great job of getting us into a child's head. It's surprising to look back and, like returning to a childhood home as an adult, realize how small everything was, after all.Childhood is a complicated thing. We see Riley's happiness, but also her immaturity. In the end - and here's kind of a spoiler - the resolution comes through growing up, not embracing childhood. Sadness can lead us just as sensibly as Joy, and perhaps even the other emotions - in their proper place - have a role in engaging the world wisely. Being happy isn't the most important thing.I'm not as impressed with the film as some. It's good, but not amazing. I wasn't a huge fan of the over-colorful milieu it embraces in its Inside sequences - it felt too much like other bright children's films I've seen, and lessened the impact of the dark Outside. I didn't find the idea as original as other did, either (I'll admit, I was thinking of Osmosis Jones, a film which is probably really terrible, but the last time I saw it I was six.)There was too much of a focus on preschool imagery for an eleven-year- old - by that age I was obsessed with dragons and pirates, rather than clowns and pink elephants. Because one could see the direction of the allegory, the story could be predictable, and I could foretell events some time before they actually happened.On the other hand, Inside Out has tons of strengths. It's the most original Pixar film since Up, and Riley's family is the best Pixar family since The Incredibles. The emotions are terrifically voiced and animated - my personal favorite is Phyllis Smith's sullen, melodramatic Sadness, but Poehler is wonderful as ebullient Joy. They're Pixar's first female duo - follow-ups to Mike and Sully and Buzz and Woody.The filmmakers have a ton of fun with Riley's mind - I especially loved the dream sets, sub-conscious, and Imaginary Boyfriend. It's really very funny - at moments, I defied the silent theater to guffaw uproariously at subtle jokes. (Or the not-subtle ones: ""GIRL - GIRL - GIRL."")Ultimately, I think the biggest compliment I can give to the movie is that (no pun intended) it got inside my head. I'm still young enough to vividly remember the confused emotions and insecurity of adolescence. These days, I often have opportunities to reflect on what my sixteen-year-old self would make of the things I'm doing now. Watching old family videos with horror just last week, I realized I have almost nothing in common with eleven-year-old Hannah. And what a complete idiot she was. And how happy she was in her idiocy! Dangit, Pixar. Inside Out is going to keep me thinking about those things for some time to come.Originally posted here: http://goo.gl/0URBvh","

"INSIDE OUT","IanAJohnson","20 April 2011","Inside Out is the story of a little girl named Riley and the little voices inside her head that control her emotions. After Riley's family moves to a new home, the emotions in her head (Joy, Anger, Disgust, Fear and Sadness) begin to experience some technical difficulties and question the purpose of Sadness. While trying to keep Riley in check, Joy and Sadness get separated from the group and have to try and get back to headquarters before Riley has an emotional breakdown. While I have found the last few of Pixar's films have strayed from their audience (either focusing too much on the children or the adults), this one is a return to form. While there are more then enough jokes meant for children and there are just as many meant for adults. I laughed quite often. The art style is perfect for the concept and the casting was perfect. There is a lot to like, but my favorite aspect of this film is the moral lesson that this film teaches. Not only is the lesson incredibly useful to not only children and adults, but it is truly helpful and a lesson that not a lot of people focus on. There are not many flaws with the film. Most of my complaints are nitpicking at best. The biggest one I have is with the structure of the plot and not the plot itself. It suffers from what I call Armageddon Syndrome (named after the first film that I noticed having this particular issue). A good plot is supposed to slowly increase tension and progress through a series of important moments until it reaches a climax where it them calms down and resolves. Armageddon Syndrome is where there seems to be little to no progress until the final climax. The plot in Inside Out just looped itself for a majority of the film until it felt like finishing. This made the movie get a little boring at times. Joy and Sadness would try some method to get back by going to locations that signify different parts of the human psyche, would fail, and try again until no more jokes and puns could be made. While this is a major, glaring issue with the film, it doesn't detract all that much since the writing is so good. The best way to think of this film is like a road trip across the country. The destinations are fun and memorable, but the drive between them is kind of boring and repetitive. Despite this I highly recommend watching Inside Out.","

"INSIDE OUT","hondema","1 December 2010","Spoiler alert: the next two paragraphs are spoiler-free, 3th one is not...I know this movie has seen all possible reviews from 1 to 10. Some are disappointed because it is not Toy Story or other Pixar movie. Personally, I don't see why it makes sense to compare this with any other title! This movie is unique in the sense that it tries to explain the workings of the brain in an understandable way. And it's been a long time since a movie affected me like this one... Last ones where Dogville and Requiem for a Dream.I have a 6 year old boy who is a fantastic kid but with some behavioral problems. I've shown him this movie so that he can understand his occasional anger and frustration attacks better. While I watched with him, I loved the way the deeds and interactions of the mind control task force is reflected in the real-world behavior of Riley.But it got especially good when the plot shows that Sadness (shunned by all as a pertinent danger to the mental health of Riley) actually is just as necessary as her counter party, Joy. Sadness has always been shunned by the others sentiments but when she is given the lead the results is not at all as tragic as we would expect... And at that point the movie comes to an yin and yang conclusion: we need both extremes of everything as only one is never complete. And you need all spikes to have a wheel. I loved that... Therefore, I also disagree with many critics who claim that this movie is too dark. It seems dark at times but the overall message is not that.Where I do agree with other commenters is on the point that this really calls for a part 2 about adolescent Riley and the new set of psychological challenges connected to that...","

"INSIDE OUT","KineticSeoul","3 January 2013","This is a family animated movie that the whole family can thoroughly enjoy. I personally think adults will enjoy this movie more than the kids though. While movies like ""Minions"" is something kids might have more fun with. Well most kids anyway...Just my opinion. I never saw the trailer to this movie before watching this movie and when I saw posters for this film. I didn't put much thought about it and thought it would be another generic kids movie. I was totally wrong, this is probably my favorite movie of 2015. It really is a brilliant animated movie that moves the inner emotions. As a matter of fact that is what this movie is about, emotions. Like how it would be like if each emotions like Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear had their own characteristics. Even if the two main emotions in this movie is Joy and Sadness. Because they are the ones on the journey back the the headquarters, while the other emotions tries to keep things under control. Each emotions interactions and how they work together mainly in the control room of the mind of a little girl named Riley was very creatively executed. And how they each has a role like a job in the human mind was wacky and yet fun. So yeah, it has a awesome premise and direction going for it. This movie had potential and took it to another level. The reason I think a lot of adult would really enjoy this movie, is because of the nostalgic and empathetic factors because of life experiences. Watching this movie was like a really good Dr. Seuss story come to life. It came from the creative minds of Pete Docter and Ronnie del Carmen. I felt like I was part of this movie and felt what the protagonist Riley was going through. This truly is a heartfelt movie with a lot of heart to it and it's also whimsical at the same time. I thought it was highly imaginative how they also incorporated imagination, conscious, unconscious, subconscious, memories and dreams. To put it simply, this is a film I really needed to watch. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that has emotions.10/10","

"INSIDE OUT","ultramatt2000-1","21 November 2010","I saw this movie and I was impressed! Back by popular demand, it's ""Matthew Praises!"" It is not just the run of the mill family movie with CGI and celebrity talents, this one is psychologically well-researched! It is a mixture between Dinsey's World War 2 propaganda short ""Reason and Emotion"" mixed with Roger Hargreaves' ""Mr. Men"". The reason why I said that is because all the emotions are controlling the girl's head just like in that cartoon. Second, I said the latter part of the comparison because like Roger Hargreaves, the were thinking, ""What would a personification of an emotion would look like?"" What would a memory bank be depicted and how would the subconscious or dreams look like? The skin of the emotions look like felt, kind of like The Muppets, except they sparkle like some sort of fire. The film gave out a good side-effect which was controlling your emotions. A father took his kid to see the movie and after watching it, he took his son to the pool and he climbed up highest diving board and dived into the pool and his father asked why he did that out of curiosity and he said that fear was driving the bus. Before the feature, there was an introduction by Pete Docter, the film's director, talking about the joy of going to the movies and the short, ""Lava"" about two volcanoes in love. Bottom line: You will laugh, you will cry and you will understand why! So come on and give it a watch it is fun for the whole family. There is no shocking moments like the ones seen on Cartoon Network today. I am positive that you will enjoy it. Bottom line: A must-watch. Rated PG for thematic elements (like references to profanity) and some action (more like some peril, but seriously MPAA raters you are just over-reacting, it should be rated G). This has been another ""Matthew Praises.""","

"INSIDE OUT","omorg-pub","25 June 2017","okay, this is why i loved this movie. it is a BRILLIANT integration of jungian and themes from Joseph campbell in the best tradition of fable telling. There are those (i am one) who believe that fables are metaphorical constructs intended to help/teach children how to deal with difficult emotional realities such as abusive parents, social terrors, and the like. This is an EMOTIONALLY intelligent film perfect for many audiences. Quite honestly, it came along at a great point in my life (and i am a 50yo woman). It reminded me that without Sadness, there can be no Joy. But it goes far deeper than that. It interprets jungian ideas about the sub/unconscious, about repression, about personality, about letting go, about growth, about complexes, shadow work, and gets into memory theory, dream research... so much more... if you are a real student of the psyche, you will see what i mean. and it boils it all down into a useful, affective metaphor. Unlike another reviewer, i did not find it triggered PTSD or depression or anything else. It has helped me accept that i have a lot of buried sadness that I've tried very hard to repress, and that that sadness has a real and valuable role to play in my life, and it may help me move forward in that respect. I don't know if that counts as a spoiler, but i tagged this review just in case.","

"INSIDE OUT","LeonLouisRicci","27 November 2010","This Wild attempt at combining the complex Inner-Workings of the Human Mind and the Wonderings and not-very-jaded, Child's Imagination and World-View was on-Its-face, something that seemed Unworkable as a ""Kids"" Animated Movie.But the Pixar ""Dream Factory"" decided it was a Go and They Got Going. What Resulted was, as expected, a Bright, Multi-Colored Universe of the Unseen and Barely Comprehensible thing that is Consciousness. The ""Voices"" Inside the Head that stem from Emotions and the Memory banks that make Us what We Are, are the Characters that Inhabit this new Movie from the reformed Team of Pixar/Disney.It is Like No other Disney or Pixar Movie and for that it Deserves Applaud for seeking New Ways to Explore the Art-Form and construct an Entertaining, somewhat Enlightening Kids/Adults Film. It's a bit Preachy here and there, and surely will be Criticized for being ""Over the Heads"" of its Target Audience, but it cannot be Faulted for trying to get ""Inside the Head"" and that it does.A Bold Experiment that had to be Tried to See if it worked and removed from its Theoretical Concept to its Final Form as a Film. If it Failed, so be it. After all, there is No Shortage of ""Princess"" and ""Fairy Tale"" type Animated Movies to Choose from the last 70 Years or so. So, Bravo for Giving this Type of Thing a Go. Considering the Reviews from Critics and Audiences, They Loved it as much as Pixar Loved Making it, and the result just might be that Occasionally We will be Treated, once and a while, with something a bit Cutting Edge and a Little Different in the Library of Animated Movies for Kids and Adults to explore. Not Everything has to be Familiar and Classical.","

"INSIDE OUT","TxMike","1 June 2018","Very nice animation, it tells the story of a young girl who has grown up in Minnesota but is uprooted when her dad and mom have to move to San Francisco with his job. Young Riley has many good memories, her friends, her hockey team. But she hits a rough patch after they move.But the animated movie isn't so much about Riley and her folks as it is about the world of ""head office."" It is an unseen world where each person, and even pets, have a tiny entity for each of their emotions, like joy, sadness, anger, etc. The story starts when Riley is first born, the team of unseen entities see through her eyes and give her emotions motivation. Her memories are represented by different color spheres stored in permanent memory in head office. The two main emotions we see are voiced by Amy Poehler as Riley's Joy and Phyllis Smith as Riley's Sadness. And we see that sometimes sadness is necessary to appreciate what is really important.I like it for the novelty, it makes one think.","

"INSIDE OUT","tomgillespie2002","1 April 2020","A film will come along perhaps once every few years that has a profound effect on me to the point that I view the world slightly differently than I did before. Inside Out - the majestic and extremely moving latest effort from Pixar - is one of those films. Pixar's back catalogue is a stellar line-up of classics, with even the lesser titles having something going for them, but I believe Inside Out is there finest to date. It's a brave, emotionally complex story that will likely leave some children depressed and adults even more so, but this is mature film-making of the very highest order.A girl named Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) is born into the world, and her mind instantly starts to develop her core emotions. Joy (Amy Poehler) is first to arrive and forms an instant bond with Riley. Soon enough, she is joined by Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling), as Riley's personality begins to develop. Joy rules the roost during Riley's happy childhood, but as the years go by and Riley moves to a new city, the other emotions start to influence her actions. After a minor breakdown in front of her new classmates, Riley struggles to adapt to the changes, and Joy and Sadness find themselves whisked off into the deepest regions of her mind while the others struggle to steady the ship.Pixar have never lacked visual imagination (they are the great innovators of computer animation after all), and they have worked overtime with Inside Out. What begins as a playful portal into the mind of an immature girl, the setting becomes more layered as she grows. Branches stretch out to reveal various aspects of Riley's personality, core memories are collected and stored in glowing spheres, and there is a literal train of thought that runs throughout the mind. The creativity is truly let off the leash when Joy and Sadness get caught up in the abstract thought region, and find themselves quickly morphing from a Picasso-esque form to two dimensional to nothing more than a straight line. The fearlessness of which directors Pete Docter and Ronnie Del Carmen approach the subject matter is one of the many endearing things about Inside Out.Along Joy and Sadness's journey, they encounter Bing Bong (Richard Kind), a ridiculous amalgamation of cat, elephant and dolphin with a candy-floss torso, who turns out to be Riley's childhood imaginary friend. As she has matured, Bing Bong has slowly been forgotten, and spends his time watching old memories. Providing welcome comic relief as well as providing an insight into a more innocent and care-free time of Riley's life, Bing Bong may just be Pixar's most ingenious creation. Well aware that his time may soon be up as he is forgotten completely, he selflessly aids Joy and Sadness (as well as hindering their progress with his constant bumbling). He is an immensely lovable but ultimately tragic character, and Pixar gracefully avoids intensely pulling the heart-strings in favour of something more emotionally honest, achieving a harder gut-punch in the process.If you go in expecting a cuddly family movie then you may be disappointed. The opening third is more interested in developing its vast, intricate world and developing the bond between the host and her emotions than delivering prat-falls and goofy voices. The human brain is a wonderful, fascinating place, and Inside Out revels in exploring its endless possibilities. It also teaches a thing or two about how we work by lumping Joy and Sadness together, two complete opposites of the same spectrum who could not exist without the other. Children's movies have always leaned towards pure escapism, a world in which true horror is either non-existent or easily defeated, but Inside Out shows us that its normal, healthy, and ultimately inevitable, to experience sadness. I don't like to throw the term 'masterpiece' around, but this is the closest Pixar have come to pure perfection.",NA
"INSIDE OUT","santiagocosme","20 March 2011","If I had watched this movie when I was 5-10, I would have probably understood none about Inside Out. I get that Pixar movies are getting more and more complicated with new generations getting brighter and cleverer, but I think this pushes the limit too far. Maybe, it's simply intentional. Disney must have realized that a big chunk of their fans are actually adults (I did not see one kid at the cinema for this movie), and the stories are adapted to please them.Either way, I can only judge for what it made me feel, and honestly, it didn't do much for me. I laughed more at the images in the final credits than I did during the entire movie. Whilst the intention of the movie is absolutely superb, and I gotta give credit to whoever came up with the idea, the actual truth is that I found myself looking at my watch and even thinking of leaving at one stage. Never, ever, have I felt that way with a Pixar movie. I don't get it!! Everyone seems to be raving about this movie, and I just did not care one bit about it. Shame. Maybe I should stick to more childish Disney movies from the good old days.",NA
"INSIDE OUT","zkonedog","11 November 2010","Toy Story...Wall-E...Up...Finding Nemo...etc. When a company (Pixar) makes films of that caliber, it is a difficult task to keep ""upping the ante"" with subsequent releases. While ""Inside Out"" is (at the very least) entertaining, it doesn't quite live up to the bar of greatness set by previous Pixar installments.For a basic plot summary, ""Inside Out"" tells the story of an 11-year old girl named Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias), who is moving from Minnesota to San Francisco. This is obviously a big change in Riley's life, and it is when we are introduced to the emotions inside her head: Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), & Disgust (Mindy Kaling). All of Riley's outward emotions are controlled by these core emotions in the ""command center"" of her brain. As Riley struggles to acclimate to her new home, school, and environment, these emotions struggle to figure out their place in the overall scheme of her personality.The concept behind ""Inside Out"" is original and entertaining. It's fun/interesting to see our emotions represented like that, and it provides for both some very happy/uplifting, as well as very sad/depressing, moments throughout. In terms of original concept and interesting ideas, ""Inside Out"" may actually be one of Pixar's best.However, I found the execution of those ideas to be only so-so. I had two complaints (this is coming from an adult perspective, of course) while watching the movie...1. When the camera ""pulls back"" to see Riley interacting with her parents and environment, that is when this film works the best. However, a majority of the film is spent inside Riley's brain dealing with the emotions themselves. For example, a subplot involving Joy being separated from the command center takes up quite a bit of time. I just wish things could have been a bit more balanced.2. More so than any other Pixar film, ""Inside Out"" seems to really ""go for the cry"", so to speak. I've never been in a theater where so many sniffles and even outright sobbing could be heard. I have no problem with that at face value, as great films are supposed to grab at the emotions, but this one just felt expressly made to do so. I shed some tears at the end of ""Toy Story 3"" and at the beginning of ""Up"", but I really feel that was because those montages were so well-made and natural to the plot of those films. With ""Inside Out"", at times I felt like the entire point of the experience was to have parents bawling.That being said, even though this one didn't rank as high as other Pixar efforts in my book, it was still fun to watch. I thoroughly enjoyed the unique concept and really liked the parts where the emotions in Riley's (and her parents') brain directly influence conversations and interactions in the real world. Highly recommended for all audiences and (as usual) perfect for families. But be warned: if you are a parent, you might want to keep a few tissues handy.",NA
"INSIDE OUT","braddugg","2 May 2011","I loved this movie and cried like crazy.Happy to have seen this in theaters, and happy to have found my sleeping kid. The kid that sleeps within me and always jumps awake at the opportune moment, was so happy seeing this. OK, now cut the kid and let the sane adult talk, as this is a review by an adult and not a kid.This adult has a story, a teenage story of changing school, being a rebel at home, and fighting with parents and teachers all through the years that he was at a new school. I changed my school when I was thirteen and the next couple of years were hell for my parents and teachers. A student with supreme conduct, suddenly turned into a disinterested rowdy with the change of school. The new school I was put in did not have good teachers, who could sing or play. They always used to teach in the most uninteresting way, and I hated all of it.OK, that's a little insight into my teenage years, but above all, this is a film that has much more than insight. I connected with this film on a deeper level, perhaps I too love reading minds. This movie is something that explores the feelings of emotions, how we react when we feel, how do we emote that feeling, it's so much more about us within than many other films, that are all about characters, plot, themes etc. This movie, could possibly be about you, check this to find that out. I found something for me and was extremely happy.The director has a daughter and she is nearly the same age as the film's protagonist Riley. Now, what's her age? Go watch the film, or as some lazy bugs do, just do some Wikipedia about director, the film, his daughter etc. I am unapologetic and actually unhappy with those who read this review and do not end up watching this.Technically, PIXAR has achieved more than any other animation studio in the world in terms of animation, story-telling and development of characters and trust me, this film is on par with any PIXAR film you have liked, be it FINDING NEMO or MONSTERS INC or TOY STORY or many more including WALL-E and UP.Having said all that, do I still need to rate this? I will do, just for the takers, it's a 5/5. I love this and I need not say more.",NA
"INSIDE OUT","framptonhollis","11 December 2010","Sometimes there comes along an excellent, well made, and masterful film that everybody loves, but, for some weird reason, all of the most popular user reviews are negative. Now, I don't mind people expressing their honest opinion, but I don't get some of the user reviews that have been posted, and I ESPECIALLY don't get why there's so many people giving it a 1/10! Sure, you can hate the movie, TOTALLY fine, but a 1/10 star rating is totally unnecessary when you have a film with such lovely animation, and so much hard work and effort clearly put into it! It really bothers me when I go through some of these reviews because I know that animation and filmmaking are extremely hard, and this isn't some lazily animated, 50 minute rip off of ""Kung Fu Panda"" (I'm looking at you, ""The Little Panda Fighter""), this is a pretty well made film. I guess this just proves that opinions are truly powerful things, but, anyway, what about the actual movie!I already said before, it is an extremely well put together animated film, full of great details and the amount of hard work and effort that was clearly put into this production is absolutely amazing! Even if you weren't 100% into the story, characters, etc., it's very well made, at least, just like any other Pixar or Disney animated film.While the concept of seeing the inside of a character's head and watching their emotions react to various things is nothing new and can be seen in various TV shows, movies, etc. (There's even an entire sitcom based around the idea called ""Herman's Head""), this film really expands upon the concept and looks at some of the tiniest details in a really clever and witty way. For example, there's one scene in which we are briefly introduced to two characters whose jobs are to take certain, unimportant memories and make the brain forget about them forever. That is only one example out of many examples of true cleverness behind ""Inside Out"".And the film isn't just fun and games, it has a truly emotional and surprisingly mature side to it that's likely to make plenty of viewers cry. Trust me, ""Inside Out"" goes to some really dark and borderline depressing places!This truly is a masterpiece.",NA

"INSIDE OUT","valen060","25 December 2012","Owing from Pixar Studios' absence last year - and it's recent over-reliance on prequels and sequels - their latest project titled Inside Out happens to be the most hilarious and emotionally-driven movie ever shown. Not since their last films Up and Toy Story 3 has there ever been a Pixar movie that will make you laugh and even move you by the time it has reached its climactic end.As the story goes, 11-year-old Riley Anderson and her family live a great life in their Minnesota town. But when her father is transferred to a new job in the Bay Area of San Francisco and has the entire family uprooted, Riley has trouble fitting in to this different environment, causing her emotions within to navigate her through a new neighborhood, new school, and new life.When it was near over, I began to take notice there were a few various fellow audience members (fewer kids and mostly adults) quietly tearing up, while it also left the gears in my mind constantly turning and pondering out of curiosity over how much the studio went through to get this concept right. To me, I feel Pixar seems to have finally rebounded from their quality blunders in the early 2010s and focused more on an entirely new, original story that has an equal balance of comedy and drama rather than just one particular genre, which doesn't usually turn out that well when trying to tell it in animated form. With a talented cast voicing the personified emotions like Amy Poehler and Bill Hader (SNL alums), Mindy Kaling, Lewis Black, and Phyllis Smith, it's like they really channeled these vibrant, colorful characters with such ease and likability. Newcomer Kaitlyn Dias wasn't bad neither voicing their human host Riley since the character's personality - from my own personal experience - started to remind me of a young niece I know. Director Pete Docter sure cranked out yet another cleverly crafted, amazing story following from his past, touching hits Monsters Inc. and Up. And he certainly meant well when he said that his movies were practically based on his family life, in this case his own preteen daughter Ellie - whom Riley is loosely modeled after.The film's concept feels near-similar to past works like 2001's Osmosis Jones (its concept was well-conceived, but how it contrasts into the real world setting didn't translate well) and the 1943 Disney short titled ""Reason and Emotion."" However the studio managed to push this concept further with an imaginative set-up where the emotions are not just the characters, but by exploring that the mind has endless possibilities and realms for them to wander outside their headquarters, depending on how well Riley's experiences (good or bad) are in the real world. It's like it frequently plays with Isaac Newton's third law of motion. One example of that had Sadness affecting one core memory by touch and it affects Riley not just physically, but mentally as well. Psychologically for an adult, we would easily get the idea if the problem isn't resolved, apathy will further escalate. Not many kids will understand why we feel moved by it, since through their perspective, they'll mostly adore the entire film as a visual and spectacle delight. With that aside, this movie never once disappointed me since it has both ambition and Pixar nostalgia written all over it. I'm also glad that since the emotions' human host is female, the writing crew did not rely on giving Riley stereotypical ""girly"" interests. Giving her a tomboy-like trait properly balances out how she can run on both sides.The moral: No matter your age or the life you live, the importance of family and your own well-being shouldn't be overlooked. Your mind says one thing, but from the heart there's something more.On a separate note: Its accompanying short subject titled Lava is definitely worth looking into. One of the best Pixar shorts I've ever witnessed in a while. Not sure why awards season overlooks their short films these days, Lava has quite a story that I consider a love letter to Hawaii.",NA

"INSIDE OUT","aienma-86023","29 March 2020","' Contain Spoiler'I warned ya.. Simply my opinion on this movie. Everyone is entitled to their opinion .Well I heard so much raved on this movie. So I just found the time to watch it for the first time .(I'm months late) , i know....Well truth to be told, the story line is too... readable. Joy being over controlling and sadness is the odd one out which reveals conflicts there , gonna be events, therefore Riley must face certain changes then of course , only natural, Joy realize all emotion must play their role to depth the 'experience' in life . its a readable plot. That what turn me off , there just too much cartoon and animation serve the same idea as this movie.' A little girl undergoing changes and unable to express her emotion properly ' We all went to this kind of phase in real life, the creator just well retell the story we all know. It is not an original idea nor fresh. Sorry. And i believe our conscience is more powerful than our emotion. It just doesn't make sense how emotion are the only thing that dictate what to do.the movie was okay. I don't hate the movie , its much more like a 50-50 feeling. The feeling that it could have been better. BUT I have to praise the creator for having such creativity in designing how one memories core work and design of the island and everything. The choices of colours vibrant of course , it's a pixar movie. The character are well developed from how Riley was a cheerful child to introvert-kinda child in a very quick time ,and well again its a pixar movie. Expect a good ending out of it. I know its targeted to children but really. We all know the majority of audience is going to be mostly adults, young adults, and children. Basically the story was targeted to 2 audience. The vibrant with crazy design were targeted to attract children while the emotion stuff and the conflict face by Riley are to target adult to well. To relate with her situation.Its a nice movie(Not really the best pixar movie ever , there other) but hoping there could be a twist there. The values that were set in the movies are already set by other old animation. Sorry for the bad review. Its my first time reviewing.all I'm saying is. ITS JUST TOO READABLE. People who watch Japanese, western or whatever animation for a long time . You know too well about the plot and value in the 'inside out story'. I was hoping something well different when i heard reviews and stuff about how fresh this idea was.",NA
"INSIDE OUT","cultfilmfan","29 December 2012","For me, modern day animated films can be a tough sell. I love animation and have since I was a child. I grew up watching a lot of the Walt Disney cartoons that kids today still watch and love. As, I grew older I got interested in more adult oriented animated films such as the work of Ralph Bakshi, Bill Plympton and films such as Gerald Potterton's Heavy Metal. I also found as I grew up that I was not really all that interested in 3D animation which really seemed to be taking off. To me it looked like you were staring at a computer program, or game and I felt it lacked emotion and a lot of the story relied on the new age type of effects and techniques the animators could now use with these computer programs and techniques. I also found the writing of the films got lazier and it just overall did not win me over at all. There were some good exceptions within the last 15 years, or so of some really good animated films such as Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away as well as Sylvain Chomet's The Triplets of Belleville. Such beautifully animated and extremely creative and well written animated films like these were unfortunately becoming a rarity. A lot of the stuff Disney and it's collaboration with Pixar, was unfortunately not working for me all that much either as I found that they often had a hard time of balancing whether to make a film that worked for both adults and kids and I sometimes found that as above mentioned, that I had problems with the 3D animation and the writing relied too heavily on this new technology and effects. There were a few exceptions, but to me something like the Shrek films (I know these are Dreamworks films and not Pixar) and films of that kind which were heavily praised and adored, were to me extremely overrated. Thankfully now with Inside Out, we are getting back to a type of animated film that has animation I like as well as a great story, creativity and will definitely work for both the adult and child audiences going to see the film. This film takes a premise of something that I think we can all relate to and makes a fascinating and very creative movie out of it, that also turns out to be a lot of fun. This one however, particular interested me. The whole human brain and dealing with emotions and the human psychosis has fascinated me ever since I was a child. At a time in my life, I felt like I wanted to be a therapist, or a counselor one day and human problems, emotions and various neurosis of different people fascinated and compelled me. Through the 90's I remember being a huge fan of the animated series, Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist and found the show very humorous as well as also really enjoying the dialogue between Katz and his patients and what was meant to be humorous and was, was also fascinating to me with what makes one think, or feel, or act this way. Inside Out, takes this to a whole new level by giving five of every human's basic chemistry and emotions into fully animated and into talking characters. We have Joy (each character is named after their emotion), Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger. The actors who do the voice over work do a terrific job and the writers have given each a wonderfully true and yet fun and playful personality and each depicting the certain feeling that they are meant to represent. Joy (who is one of the main characters of the film) is so bubbly and just an absolute joy to watch that you get enjoyment and just feel happiness just radiating from her that she is literally a joy to watch. All the other characters each have their own priceless moments and really add to the film as well. The human characters in this story each depict average everyday people and the different emotions we go through on an everyday basis making the film easy for a viewer of any age to relate and connect to. The film is creative in both it's writing, voice over work and animation. The film takes us through many adventures and many brilliantly conceived ideas and plot devices, but also hits home once in awhile and makes us think of our own body chemistry and our own emotions at times. This is the most creative and flat our brilliant I have seen in a mainstream animated film in a long time. Inside Out works for both adults and kids and is fun, visually pleasing and has everything that should set off the perfect modern day animated film. Disney and Pixar's best in awhile.",NA
"INSIDE OUT","Ramascreen","24 October 2019","Last year we didn't get a Pixar movie, and the year before that, the only thing they gave us the fans was that easily forgettable ""Monsters University,"" so it's good to see Pixar returning, full force, with this latest masterpiece, INSIDE OUT, which reminds us of how good Pixar is when they make well-written, well thought-out heartfelt original stories instead of sequels. INSIDE OUT is one of the best movies I've seen this year and I hope it would ultimately be a potential Oscar contender come award season because it deserves all the success.The way to describe Pixar's INSIDE OUT without wording it too much is that basically the minute you sit in that theater's seat to watch this movie, you're practically enrolled in Pixar's study of adolescent psychology 101. But I can assure, it's more fun than your regular boring class lectures. Co-directed by the man behind my #1 all-time favorite Pixar movie, ""Up,"" Oscar-winning filmmaker Pete Docter and along with Ronaldo Del Carmen and scribes Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley, they crafted this elaborate, engaging and entertaining story that essentially could help parents everywhere who suddenly have to face the fact that their kids are no longer the little adorable kids they once knew; that stage between childhood and teenage years without necessarily going into the teenage years because Pixar is not in the business of doing horror movies. All joking aside, this movie wants to explain, in a very Pixar way, how young ones may resist change but that change is ultimately something to be accepted, and the emotions they go through in order to deal with that change.INSIDE OUT introduces 5 different emotions and present them in five very eccentric characters: Joy, anger, sadness, disgust, and fear. I'm not sure how many emotions we humans biologically have but Pixar settles on these five. And each of them is very into who they are, for example, fear would extremely be afraid at all times and joy can be so optimistic that she sounds annoying, makes you want to just punch her and tell her to shut the hell up. These five emotions live to serve a little girl named Riley who had a beautiful childhood, evidenced by her many fun and loving memories. Her childhood is every kid's envy, not that her family is rich but that her parents and friends were always there for her, and she loved her school, her neighborhood, her town. Until the day when Riley's family has to move to San Francisco and it's a completely drastic change for Riley. Joy is somewhat of the leader of this emotion command control, the rest would look up to her when they don't know what to do or when they don't know which emotion Riley should be feeling. And in Joy's mind, Riley should literally always be up and happy all the times. And that's when sadness comes in and feels compelled to touch the core memories. Long story short, without spoiling any critical plot points. Joy and Sadness end up by themselves, separated from the others, and away from the control room, so they have to find their way back and it's not an easy journey.The concept itself is brilliant, Pete and his filmmaking team created these 'Islands' to represent certain aspects that we humans may be surrounded with as a child: friendship, family, the ability to be goofy. But as we grow up, those islands will crumble. In their journey back, Joy and Sadness encounter imagination character named Bing Bong and at first when I watched the movie, I thought Bing Bong was going to be the antagonist, but there's not really an antagonist in this story. Even these emotions themselves, just like Riley, would have to learn that things aren't always going to stay the same forever. The animation is Pixar's most pristine work yet. The moment Riley was born, the emotions miraculously existed and their hair and body look like they're made up of some sort of sparkling floating firefly lights of blue, green, yellow, red, and purple, like you want to get close and just examine them in details.Pete Docter was very smart to have cast this amazing group of funny people to voice these emotions. Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Bill Hader as Fear, Mindy Kaling as disgust, and the legendary Lewis Black as Anger. I mean c'mon here, all these guys are practically born to voice these particular emotions, especially Lewis Black who's spent most his career being labeled the angry comedian, that's how he banks his humor. The stars are aligned for INSIDE OUT. The tone is what you'd expect in a Pixar movie, a mix of fun, thrill, adventure and moments that can make you cry, but it's a healthy cry, composer Michael Giacchino's music knows which buttons to push to get those tears flowing. I don't think INSIDE OUT means to tell parents that this is what you should or shouldn't do. It's simply an illustration, Pixar-style, describing that change is inevitable, it's part of growing up, but if you'll be there for your loved ones and just listen to them, they'll invite you to be part of that change and that's family moving forward.",NA
"INSIDE OUT","china-tr","24 November 2010","Inside Out is a 2015 American 3D computer-animated comedy-drama adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures.

When I watched the film, I sympathize with Riley. The highlight of the film is that Riley grows up as she experiences many things.",NA
"INSIDE OUT","yaseenfawzi","5 December 2010","""Inside Out,"" the new animated feature from Disney/Pixar, partially takes place inside the mind of a young girl named Riley. There, sentient emotions operate inside Headquarters, each one representing whatever she is actually feeling: Joy, Disgust, Fear, Anger, and Sadness. After she is uprooted from her life in Minnesota and moves to San Francisco following her father's announcement of his new job, Riley's emotions begin to conflict as she tries to control her emotions and navigate life at a new house, new school, and new friends. Likewise, an accident inside Headquarters causes great difficulty and Joy and Sadness to be sucked out, so they must team up to find all of Riley's memories and return home before it is too late.Directed by Pete Docter (""Monsters, Inc.,"" ""Up""), this film could be considered a return to form for Pixar following the mostly lukewarm or decent reception of their previous films, including ""Cars 2"" and ""Monsters University."" While not overtly original, the way the concept is handled is what makes the movie so unique. As every emotion is one part of the total personality, so too are their characterizations and character design. Even the level of detail on the animation is noteworthy, such as the energy particles the emotions sometimes leave behind or the realistic facial effects of newborn Riley. The same can also be said of the visual design, with bright and vivid colors remaining prominent inside Riley's mind. Clever visual motifs include the Long-Term Memory resembling a large cerebral cortex, Imagination Land with its french-fry forest, and the backlot of Dream Productions, where dreams are filmed.In addition, each cast member perfectly suits their animated counterparts, with Amy Poehler providing the necessary exuberance for Joy and Lewis Black in the all too fitting role of the irascible Anger. Phyllis Smith, Bill Hader, and Mindy Kaling round out the rest of the lead cast, portraying Sadness, Fear, and Disgust. Perhaps the most interesting character is Bing-Bong, who used to exist as Riley's imaginary friend when she was younger, and has the the tail of a cat, face and trunk of an elephant, and the lower-half of a cotton candy stick. He provides an extra dose of humor and character throughout.The story is neatly-structured in a way that doesn't leave any part of it feeling rushed. The quality of the animation, as is typical of Pixar, is superb. Some standout moments of humor in ""Inside Out"" include a running gag containing the memory of a gum commercial, the filming of the re-enactment of the first day of school by Dream Productions using their ""reality distortion filter,"" and a sequence visually depicting abstract thought, where the characters briefly become abstract shapes themselves and gradually turn into flat, two-dimensional lines.""Inside Out"" reminds us of the excitement, suspense, and most importantly, joy we feel when going to the movies.",NA
