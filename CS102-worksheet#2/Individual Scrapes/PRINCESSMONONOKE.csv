"PRINCESS MONONOKE","zetes","7 November 1999","Princess Mononoke is, without a doubt, one of the best films I have ever witnessed. There has never been an animated film even close to this -- I kept thinking after I left the theater, how can Disney even have the guts to make another film after seeing this? Even live action movies pale in comparison to Princess Mononoke. There has never been a film to pay such close attention to details. Watch for the magnificent and subtle flying insects throughout the film, especially in the ancient forest, where bioluminescent dragonflies glide gently around the screen. There are thousands of subtleties such as this. You'd have to see it a dozen times to appreciate this film fully. Aside from it being the most beautiful film I've ever seen, it also has an enormously powerful script. The characters are some of the the most well rounded in all film. Ashitaka especially, the main character of the film, is so nuanced that he has become in my mind one of the great characters in film, up there with Charles Foster Kane and Jake LaMotta. I would compare him to Freder, the main character of Fritz Lang's Metropolis. His role in the film is a mediator between the forces of humans and the gods of nature. Both sides comment several times that Ashitaka must be on the other side, when he is trying desperately to convince everyone that there are no sides. Peace is the way. There is a little to be desired in the American voice talent. Claire Daines was certainly a wrong choice for San (Princess Mononoke), and Billy Bob Thornton just could not hide his southern accent, which made the character of Jigo seem more comical than he was probably supposed to be. Gillian Anderson's voice clashed with her character, the wolf god Moro, a bit. It hardly affected my passion. The film was so spectacular and beautiful that James Earl Jones could have voiced San and it would have detracted little. Definitely, though, I'm praying that they release the DVD with subtitle options. Anyway, Princess Mononoke is the best film of 1999, the best film of the 1990's, and, in my personal top ten list, no lower than #5, but closer to #2. 12 hours later and my heart is still beating with the power of Princess Mononoke! America: SEE IT!","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","TanjBennett","15 April 2003","This seems to be Miyazake's most personal work, clearly a serious design. It is set in an imaginary time which blends the time of the ancient gods (Shinto style, gods of place and nature) with the settlement of humans and the coming of metalworking and war.  The world is not in balance, and a distant conflict between industry and nature has wounded one of the gods of the forest, which is then killed by a sentry boy as it rampages into farmland he guards.  The evil controlling it transfers to him, beginning a slow takeover, and he must journey to the origin of the conflict to find a way to cure himself and incidentally, as he will learn, to try to restore balance.  But this is not a simplistic tale, he finds there are other characters in play, and there is good and evil in everyone, and no easy balance.  The Princess (Hime) of the story is a mysterious human who has been raised by wolves (which are themselves powerful forest gods, a little reminiscent of the Amerindian Coyote myth), who becomes both his ally and his enemy.  The story is not easy to understand.  It has many Japanese mythic elements but even then, it is a work of Miyazake's unique imagination, and is not intended to be simple or to have a clean resolution.The animation is spectacular, and unusual, with new elements even for Miyazake and marks a new departure for style which you can see continued in his next film, Sen to Chihiro - more nature, more wild, more jamming on elements from Japanese myth and folklore.  And, continuing the trend to be more personal, concerned with ethics and character, and less sci-fi. There are at least half a dozen well developed characters threaded through the story, and their animation is wonderful in displaying subtle character.The original Japanese soundtrack has some amazing singing and draws upon some of the best talent available for voices - in Japan, Miyazake is universally known and this was a masterpiece carefully crafted.  Japanese television documented a lot of the production.  The English translation drew on some good talent but they seem not to have ""gotten it"" quite so intensely as the Japanese crew.If you haven't seen Miyazake, give it a try (but maybe look at Sen to Chihiro first, or even Laputa or Kiki's Delivery Service, for easier and lighter introduction to his work).  Some say he is the Japanese Disney, but I don't like that.  His work has a depth and sophistication that goes beyond Disney cute.  There is no other animation like it.  This is truly an adult work: children might like some of the visuals, but I doubt that many kids below teen age will have any idea what it is all about, and even adults will get more out of this each time you see it again.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","TheLittleSongbird","4 August 2009","Princess Mononoke is one of the best animated movies I have seen in a long time, and is up there with Studio Ghibli's best along with Spirited Away. I will say I am probably biased, as I am a huge Studio Ghibli fan, and love all of their films, I even like Cat Returns, which along with PomPoko is considered as one of the weaker Ghibli efforts. The animation in Princess Mononoke is absolutely stunning, with rich detailed backgrounds and brilliant character animation. The image of the Stag actually made my jaw drop. The music is fantastic as well, and although environmentalism is a subject matter very difficult to get right, what the filmmakers succeeded in doing was making a highly intriguing story that was not only original but succeeded in not being preachy at all. The film is also helped by the high calibre vocal talents of Minnie Driver, Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton et al (voicing quite remarkable characters) and a strong script. True, some of the images like the Demon Worm, may frighten younger viewers, but it is fair to say they were very powerful. All in all, Princess Mononoke is breathtaking and I recommend it highly. 10/10 Bethany Cox","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","JTurner82","20 March 2005","In its theatrical Japanese release of 1997, PRINCESS MONONOKE was the hugest box office grossing movie of all time in the land of the Rising Sun until it was overtaken by James Cameron's TITANIC, and, four years later, director Hayao Miyazaki's own SPIRITED AWAY. No wonder. This movie, like an earlier project of Miyazaki's, NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND, explores man's relationship with nature, hatred causing destruction, and, more importantly, real characters (in other words, no real ""hero"" or ""villain"") trying to get by in a world continually torn by war.This is not a movie for young children, as there are disturbing shots of decapitations, amputations, and occasional blood spurts. Sometimes these elements of violence turn squeamish viewers away from Anime (especially when they're done gratuitously), but Hayao Miyazaki presents it not to sicken people but to show it for the horror that it is (plus, in this film, the violence is not overdone). Take, for example, the scene where the protagonist, Prince Ashitaka of the Emishi Tribe, possessed by a curse he received from killing a Demon God (in trying to protect his village), tries to stop samurai attacking innocent people, and in doing so shoots the arms off of one man, and, later, takes off a man's head with two arrows. The sight is horrifying to see, but the deed also increases Ashitaka's demon mark on his arm, which is slowly preparing to take his life. This is a truly horrible depiction about the dangers of violence.Also worth noting is Princess Mononoke herself, a human girl named San raised by the Animal Gods, and her struggle against Lady Eboshi of Iron Town, who is destroying the forest merely for her people's own good (the folks are outcasts, including lepers and prostitutes). San distrusts and despises all humans, and is especially determined to destroy them all (particularly Eboshi)... or die trying. When she's rescued by Ashitaka, however, a conflict within her begins to surface: are *all* humans evil, or is there at least one who is trustworthy? If there is any character who could be considered a villain, it would be the monk, Jigo, who wants the head of the Spirit of the Forest to bring to the Emperor. Such a deed would destroy the entire forest (as we find out in the film's chilling climactic scenes) but even Jigo has his own motives, too. He is not so much evil as much as he is just ""trying to get by"". This pretty much sums up the conflicts between all our characters here.PRINCESS MONONOKE may not have enjoyed similar box office success here in America, but at least a lot of work and care went into the translation. As with Disney's other English language tracks for Miyazaki's films, this one is very, very well done. Acclaimed writer Neil Gaiman worked on the script, rewording it only to a) fit the mouth flaps, and b) make it understandable to a non-Japanese audience who would probably not comprehend a lot of the cultural nuances found in this film. Added to which, the voice cast includes a commendable list of stars; Billy Crudup is perfect as Ashitaka, eliciting just the right amount of warmth, kindness, compassion, wisdom, and courage, while Claire Danes delivers passionately angry, conflicted turmoil to San. (Folks said she was miscast, but I beg to differ; her character is *required* to be outraged and aggressive, and Danes does have a strong voice to carry such emotions.) The rest of the cast includes Billy Bob Thornton as Jigo (a grossly underrated performance; his Southern drawl adds to the character), Minnie Driver (elegant choice!) as Lady Eboshi, Gillian Anderson as the Wolf-Goddess Moro, and Jada Pinkett-Smith as the friendly (if no-nonsense style) worker Toki. The translation flows smoothly to those who are not familiar with Japanese folk tales, and the story succeeds in making its point, too.This movie may not be for everybody, as it is the kind of film that may disturb young children, but older audiences will find themselves absorbed in the artwork, which showcases gorgeous, unmatched imagination, from the finely detailed forests to the cute little Tree Spirits who appear and disappear at will to the Forest Spirit itself -- a huge deer who makes plants grow with each step he takes. And at night he becomes a ghostly specter known as the Nightwalker, traveling higher than the trees. Such images warrant the purchase of this film. Better yet, its message is not too preachy, and rarely do animated movies (save those from Japan) showcase characters portrayed as, well, human beings.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","misty6767","14 August 2004","The first time I saw Princess Mononoke I was completely moved and surprised. Since it was a Studio Ghibli film dubbed by Disney I liked the fact that it wasn't a ""they all lived naively ever after"" film. There were no complete ""good"" or ""bad"" guys. Even Lady Eboshi the most antagonist character in the movie had a reasonable motive for trying to get rid of the animal gods and cutting down the forest. Although it her actions were environmentally damaging and wrong in general, she did it to help her people survive which is what all the species on Earth strive for. Another wonderful aspect of the plot is that it sends a message - Protect the Earth and all will survive in peace - a message either discreetly or strongly portrayed in many of Miyazaki's films. Perhaps the portrayal of this message (and the tiny hint of San and Ashitaka's romance and Moro's views on nature) was what made the film so touching to me.Like many Miyazaki movies, the animation (as always) is wonderful and nicely detailed which is also another quality that genuine Disney films lack (thank goodness for Studio Ghibli). The music was beautiful and well suited to the movie.The only predicament to the movie is that it is a bit downbeat and does not contain much happy laughter (oh well, I can watch My Neighbor Totoro - also a good movie - for happy laughter.).10/10 - And my favourite movie of all time.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","morphion2","7 January 2006","Studio Ghibli has been Japan's leading anime Production Company since the 1980's, when legendary anime director Hayao Miyazaki released his first feature film ""Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind"" (1984). From the very beginning, it was clear that the Japanese director had a fantastic flair for animated film, and the uncanny ability to engross his audiences beyond the normal movie-experience that makes him the King of Escapism. Over ten years later, it seems that Miyazaki is still just as good, if not better, as he invites the world into his latest visionary fantasy, the cult classic ""Princess Mononoke"".The film is set in Japan, during the Muromachi Era, and begins in the quiet peaceful township of the Emishi tribe, when young Prince Ashitaka (Yôji Matsuda), the last of the Emishi royalty, is wounded slaying a demon in an unexpected attack. When the tribe's wise-woman tells Ashitaka that the wound is a curse of hatred that will eventually kill him, he sets out on a journey to the west to discover the origins of the demon. What he finds is a war being waged between the villagers of Iron town, an industrious Iron-works fort led by the ruthless Lady Eboshi (Yûko Tanaka), and the beasts of the forest, represented by the beautiful Princess Mononoke (Yuriko Ishida), a human girl raised by wolves, with whom the cursed prince falls in love. Soon Ashitaka's efforts to make peace are put to the test by each side's bid for allegiance.""Princess Mononoke"" is a fantastic work of art on many fronts, and arguably Miyazaki's best film to date. While some of his other projects have had the same enchantment and excitement, ""Mononoke"" has an intriguingly dark and infinitely more mature feel, established by the bloody battle-scenes and sensitive color treatment, and solidified by a complex plot and rich, interesting characters. The most obvious illustrative trait of the film is the ambiguity of the characters' nature; the lack of distinction between good and bad. The ruthless lady Eboshi, while caring nothing for the forest or its inhabitants, is very compassionate towards the underdogs of her own community, such as the brothel girls and the lepers. And the wild wolf-princess, while desperate to defend her fellow forest-dwellers and protect the forest spirit, has a deep-seated mistrust of humans that even steeps into self-loathing at times. These interesting character traits make the film a lot more rewarding than many of Ghibli's other works, which were aimed mostly at children.Of course, all these intriguing themes and characters are only a part of the film's wonder, because Miyazaki's true gift lies in imagery. The detailed animation of ""Princess Mononoke"" is astounding, drawing its audience into its environments, from lush forest to open fields to crowded marketplace and more; the team of animators that poured their hearts and souls into this film should take utmost pride in their accomplishments. Using minimal and tasteful CGI, the movie stays very warm and inviting even when the subject matter and mood is less-than-friendly. This is also owed to the audio aspects of the picture; the voice talents involved are highly engaging and enjoyable, even in the English dubbed version, which features such big western names as Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, Billy Crudup, Clare Danes and Gillian Anderson. Joe Hisaishi's music is also a rather splendid complement to the film.Overwhelming success of the anime production in Japan alone stands as a testament to its fine quality. Breaking a 15 year record held by Spielberg's ""E.T."", ""Princess Mononoke"" became Japan's No. 1 movie of all time in the year of its release, as well as taking the title of best-selling video/DVD of all time. It is also the most expensive animated Japanese feature in history, reaching a budget of 2.4 billion. Outside of its home-country, however, the film continues to inspire and engage audiences from all corners of the globe, taking a well-deserved place in the list of cult-favorites for film-lovers everywhere.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Rectangular_businessman","12 June 2010","Ever since I was a kid, I was fascinated by animation, I watched way too many cartoons and would often drawn them myself. I never thought of animation as ""real art"" or anything fancy, just one of life's simple pleasures. Sure Disney had made some ground-breaking animated features, and technology was allowing for more and more detailed and intricate animation techniques, but no animated film had ever moved me as much as a Godfather or Unforgiven or Dr. Strangelove, that is until one fine day in 1999. I was in high school, and Princess Mononoke was premiering at the Coolidge Theater in Brookline, I was pumped as I really enjoyed Castle in the Sky and Totoro, so I went to the theater with a few friends and was absolutely clown away for this. This film is so spectacular in almost every way and every piece comes together perfectly. The animation is top-notch, not that shoddy 1980's anime style, but the mind-blowing animation techniques that made Miyazaki the maestro his is today. The score by Joe Hisaishi is tremendous, though at times it may seem a bit overly dramatic (I mean this is an animated feature, not Lawrence of Arabia), but this is the ultimate animated epic, so it fits in well. The plot is dense and the characters are well-developed, there are no true ""good"" or ""bad"" guys in this film...and Miyazaki includes his favorite underlying theme of Man vs. Nature throughout. Some may argue that Spirited Away was Miyazaki's crowning achievement, but I believe that Mononoke Hime is his true Masterpiece.","

I had read quite a bit about this film and its director but was still totally overwhelmed by the beauty and brutality of this movie.  The complexity of this movie is something never seen in the United States in an animated movie and even exceeds that of most live action movies as well.  It combines love and hate, war and romance, nobility and deception in ways rarely seen in movies today.  Lines of good and evil are anything but clear cut and in the end is hope but no guarantees, no promises.  This is truly an adult movie but my children, ages 12 to 15 all loved it and talked about it for days later.  Even my wife who holds a strong prejudice against Japanese animation enjoyed this movie.Go and see this movie.  You won't be disappointed.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Quinoa1984","11 June 2006","Some might watch Princess Mononoke and find ambiguity at times. It's goes beyond formula into something that challenged me, the interplay between the forces of nature where sometimes the seemingly 'good' side is not what it seems, until the bigger, darker picture comes into view. It's a purely imaginative effort, with a level of dramatic- more over cinematic- power that I'd compare with Kurosawa on a level. Princess Mononoke, in its uncompromising way, details the violence without pulling away while also being rather anti-violent in the process. It is also hard to pinpoint on any one level. Visually it's got so much going on to practically experience the abstractions that Hayao Miyazaki folds up into the rest of the story. The story itself trails along with the best of epic fantasy, with this crucial, earth-shattering quest that works on that level of action-adventure (possibly more for adults despite the PG-13 rating here in the States) as well as the mythological side of things. Some have written that it is a bit of a complex film in structure and storytelling, bordering on confusing. I would disagree, though I can see what they mean- you have to pay closer attention than usual of more American films. But on a more profound level, if one could call it such, it's really not hard to follow.The hero of the film, interesting enough, is the type of tragic hero, though with one clear sight amid the chaos on the two sides he encounters- peace. He is cursed by a sort of wormy-jelly demon that runs unyielding in the darker recesses of the world. He searches for something to rid him of his scars while on the human side at some points (mostly dominated by the women impressed- or against- his skills), and with those of the wolves on the other side. The title character is part of the latter, though also human, bringing a little more of the underlying symbolism with a character. Then there are also the boars ready to destroy the humans, even to their demise. Amid the battles that rage on, leading to the significance of a certain 'Deer God' as the centerpiece of the balance of the forests and civilizations, not too much is made explicit. At the same time, the side taken by the cursed hero is even questioned by one character, and with that part connected with the others the story trumps what could have been a kind of smothering over-symbolic representation into what is necessary and spectacular about the film.In fact, I would estimate on just the near bravery of what Miyazaki is achieving in the film, it's one of the best films of its kind. And 'of its kind' in this case is the animated film that breaks conventions and the typical 'good vs. evil' logic. Many times the suddenness of things had me wide-eyed, and each creature or little variance on the creations- both good and evil- are elaborated with out compromise. The digitally-animated worm-Jelly type monsters are some of the more memorable ones, to be sure, as they book-end the picture in different extraordinary ways (the climax in particular probably ranks with the best of the last decade or so). The tiny bobble-headed alien creatures are also a delight as they rattle and gather and multiply and flee all around; this is the kind of scene that is dream-like to a truly weird and bright sensibility. And many scenes that have more of that samurai-movie quality to them (again, Kurosawa) are extremely well-done on their own as then they become mixed around again with the fantasy elements.To say that the film is really a 'family' film might be not entirely accurate, as some of the battle and attack footage is pretty graphic in its own ways, if not as much as other more adult anime like Fist of the North Star or Ninja Scroll. There are even moments I would say that, had I been little and watching some of the more twisted and macabre scenes, I might have cried from it. But this is a credit to Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli; for older kids this could mark as something that is, indeed, foreign to their expectations, at least American ones. It is a work of art, not just animation, that takes chances and isn't afraid to go for the right twists and leaps of creation and at the same time keeping its message noticeable but not overbearing. It's a film I can't wait to see again, and likely my favorite of the filmmaker's too, with the same cinematic drive as in the other works I've seen but reaching the ambitious heights it intends.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Gresh854","22 July 2018","I'm so thrilled that I decided to watch Princess Mononoke for the first time ever on the big screen. Studio Ghibli is just nonstop in terms of their animated quality (leaving most animated studios in the dust) even in times like the 90s when this film was released. The action sequences are crafted with such care and such brutality that it's hard not to be remarkably energized by them. The characters surrounding the movie are so engaging and iconic which immensely supports a deeply fleshed-out and powerfully thought-provoking story. Princess Mononoke is a breathtakingly painted tale of a man on a quest to balance two opposite ends of a war filled with hatred, greed, and violence. The conflict of siding between two teams is quite apparent in the film, and it's resolutions are as beautiful as they are significantly important in the real world throughout human history and especially today.

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Boba_Fett1138","3 July 2012","You really don't have to be into anime to appreciate some of the movies that the genre has to offer. Some of them are being simply so good and captivating that basically everybody should be able to get grabbed by it. And I feel that this is one of those movies, that is being a great blend of adventure and fairytale elements.It's really a movie that speaks to your imagination. It's set in a fantasy world, that still feels and looks a lot like our world and the movie is literally loaded with some great and impressive looking fantasy creatures, with the one even bigger and more amazing than the other. In essence this is a mankind versus nature type of movie, in which nature does a lot of fighting back! I can definitely see how ""Avatar"" got 'inspired' by this movie and it features some similar themes and at times also a similar type of atmosphere in it. And I should say though that I liked this movie far better than ""Avatar""! The themes worked out better and were overall more effective and as a whole the story of this movie worked out more pleasantly.I should admit though that the movie can get quite hard to follow at times, will all of its things that are happening and characters that are in it. But this is a 'problem' I have with basically every anime and it very rarely ever ruins the movie experience for me, so it's no complaint or problem really. The movie has some great strong characters in it that can hold their own, amidst all of the great and powerful looking creatures in this movie. And there really are a whole bunch of characters in this movie but this never becomes anything distracting and the movie also never looses its focus. All thanks to some great storytelling skills of course, by Hayao Miyazaki.The animations are absolutely great looking and help to give the movie a great and effective fantasy atmosphere. What I also like about it is that's being such an easy thing to exaggerated things when your animation it, especially all of the action but everything in this movie feels 'real' and doesn't goes over-the-top with things, despite the presence of lots of fantasy elements and characters in it.Another thing worth mentioning is the musical score by Joe Hisaishi. Some great stuff!Whether you like anime or not, this is a great fantasy-adventure movie for everybody, everywhere!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.nl/","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","seamas","11 January 1999","I saw this film in Japan, in Japanese with no sub-titles, I don't speak a word of the language and I was still enthralled!  It is Miyazaki most visually intense (surpassing, at long last, Nausicaa) and is alive with color and movement the like not yet seen in anime.The story is complex, and after talking with Japanese friends, it is clear that much of it went over my head (particularly that relating to specific Japanese myths), but the important elements came through. Miyazaki's long infatuation with technology verses nature and man's relation to God (or gods) weave throughout the film as does his trend for strong women characters. Even with the language barrier, the film is of such intense emotion that it caries you through to the end. The change in dynamic between the crashing fight scenes and the quiet scenes of healing by the lake is so broad and so well paced that I can't remember a film where my emotional state was so expertly varied.If you have a chance to see this film, in any language, I recommend you do.","

Especially the giant pig suffering of a demonic disease scared the hell out of me back than. But never less is knew that this movie is something special, something I have never seen before. Since then I became a huge fan of Studio Ghibli and watched nearly everything they have produced. But still 'Princess Mononoke' stands out to me as their best work and to me is Hayao Miyazakis masterpiece. The topic of this movie is just as simple as complex. It's the fight between human culture coming with the technologic industry versus the nature and its variety of animals living in it and to this day it's a pretty relevant topic. The way both sides are portraied in this movie is just beautiful. Miyazaki manages to show both sides with all their strength and weaknesses. There's no good side or bad side. Instead every side can be understood by the viewer and even if you don't agree with their opinions you still are able to see why each side acts like they do. The visual work is top notch like always with Studio Ghibli. I love how they create a feeling for nature as one whole organism. I really recommend everyone to go watch this movie. To me this is one of the best movies ever created.","

Depicting the clash between the natural ecological system and the modern urbanisation of mankind. Two opposing ideals and environments that struggle to cohabit in unison. An important environmental statement: be good to nature and nature will be good to you. A fundamental statement that doesn't at all feel preachy, but yet it's ever so present throughout every artistic scene. Strip away the fantasy elements and you are still left with a poignant plot that consistently engages throughout its runtime. Every scene matters, every scene builds upon each other like a stack of bricks to then culminate for an epic third act. The animation is stunning. A work of art. The imagination and creativity that is portrayed on screen is a wonder to behold, and will appeal to everyone. The English dub was well done, all the voice actors suited their roles. San's voice did take some time for me to warm to, but by the end I was on board. Surprisingly, this is an emotional journey. Towards the end where there are a few deaths, I actually felt saddened. The biggest impact of them all was actually the destruction of the environment, Miyazaki somehow creates a personality out of the forest to which I connected to it on an emotional level. Masterful work, it really is. Also, the musical score was mesmerising. Slight warning, its rated a PG but I think it will too much for younger viewers. Lots of severed limbs and bloody imagery that I'm sure will invoke nightmares. Princess Mononoke is the best Studio Ghibli animation I've seen, it's an epic masterpiece that everyone should watch. For that reason it gets the perfect rating.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","jzappa","24 September 2006","Princess Mononoke is a grand, beautifully animated, heartfelt epic. It's a historical fantasy adventure, it's a melodrama, it's a race against time. Its pace is wonderful, taking us climactically through the all-embracing, outspread scope of the story. It has heart, it has violence, it has visual beauty, it has internal conflict.What I like the most about Princess Mononoke is beyond all of these wonderfully delivered elements of a great movie. It's a movie about compassion and understanding towards animals. Yes, these animals are represented by gargantuan, violent beasts, but the movie is about human headstrong influence vs. animal outlook, sense, and behaviorism. It's about how astonishingly much more acute and attuned an animal's understanding is of the world's natural order than that of a human's.I think Princess Mononoke, while being a beautifully made action-adventure, it's an important film, especially for Miyazaki's younger fans. It's important that they take the message of the film seriously.","

Good dialogs, beautiful soundtrack,incredible animation effects (take a look at the rain, at the movement of the grass, hear the sounds of the steps) and interesting characters,who are everything but ordinary. Ashitaka is captivating (what a strength, what a heart, what a soul!); San (the Princess Mononoke herself) is intriguing; and Lady Eboshi is ambiguous -is she the villain? I don't think so. After all, who can blame her? Don't let the over exploration of themes related to ecology discourage you. Go ahead and watch Mononoke. It's a totally new way of treating the conflict between men and nature, which is far from its ending. Definitely, a jewel among the predictable animations of Disney and Pixar's also predictable jokes. There are no jokes here. TAKE A LOOK AT IT!","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","bob the moo","20 January 2004","When he is touching by a demon while defending his village, Ashitaka is sent out to the West, from where the crazed demon originated, seeking a cure for the demon infection that will otherwise kill him.  However, in seeking the domain of the gods he walks into the middle of a three-way battle between the samurai, who want Iron Town's iron deposits; Lady Eboshi who rules Iron Town and is stripping the forest of it's trees to mine it out; and finally the animals and spirits of the forest who must defend their homes, fighting for them is the human Mononoke, a young woman raised by the wolves.It is hard to top Spirited Away, and it is maybe unfair of me to come to this film after I had seen that.  This film cannot match the sheer wonder that I felt when I saw that film but this is still an accomplished film who's story is it's strength and weakness.  The story is a pretty good tale that paints a reasonably good picture of this far off land, although some elements of the plot are a little thinner than I would have liked (namely the samurai).  However it still manages to be engaging despite this - although of course it was never going to be as personal a story as Spirited Away.  The obvious message of peace between man/industry and nature is more than just the usual one; where Lord Of The Rings was very much nature good, iron bad; this film is a lot more balanced and doesn't look at either badly.While this runs in the background everything is fine but, when the film has to tie everything up it doesn't quite manage it.  The ending is strangely very fast in happening and it ends on a morally good solution but one that I found to be emotionally quite unsatisfying.  I must admit that the final 5 minutes left me feeling a little abandoned by the characters.  However other than this the story is pretty exciting and the two hours go by pretty quickly.The characters are interesting but I never managed to really get behind anyone other than Ashitaka.  Eboshi was too unpleasant to relate to while Mononoke herself was too distant despite the occasional times where I felt for her.  Part of this may be down to the voice cast in the US version. In Spirited Away the US cast fitted the film really well, here it is less the cast.  Crudup is, ironically, one of the best voices in the cast.  I say ironically because I couldn't place him in comparison to the more famous cast.  Driver is OK but her character wasn't.  Danes is pretty good and I felt that her character improved due to her good voice work.  Anderson was miscast and her voice simply didn't fit her character at all (even with the echo added).  Thornton was good for the more comedic role but slightly took away from the dramatic impact of the samurai.  Pinkett-Smith brings her attitude to the role well and both she and Keith David are funny.Visually it is as impressive as you would expect from Miyazaki.  It all looks great, the whole land is filled with detail and it flows so freely. The spirits and gods are imaginative and very well drawn and the people show up just how basic stuff like Pokemon really is!  It is a little too gory to be for kids (even though it is rated pg in the UK) but the vast majority of it is as detailed as you wished more kids' animation was.Overall I really enjoyed this film but occasionally found it difficult to get past some of it's weaknesses.  The characters are not all as strong as I would have liked and some of their voices aren't that good.  The ending is a bit of a letdown as I was hoping for a more emotionally satisfying conclusion to the story.  Despite this, it is still a wonderful film and easily one of the best animations I have seen.","

This was shown to them. It was an excellent choice by the Ghibli studio.

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","classicsoncall","12 January 2015","A difficult story to follow and decidedly scary animation at times makes this more an adult film than one for younger fans. It's not too hard to follow in the early going but when the hero Ashitaki makes his way East to the land of the Forest Spirit he's faced with choices that put him on questionable sides of relationships already formed. While trying to save his own life endangered by a poisonous encounter with the boar demon Nago, his overriding mission is to 'see with eyes unclouded by hate'. For this he must valiantly strive to understand the motivations and prerogatives of those he meets, including monk Jigo, Lady Eboshi of Irontown and the wolf princess San, a human raised by wolves. In turn, each of these individuals comes to understand that good and evil are not mutually exclusive character traits, but exist in all to varying degrees. The way this all plays out can be confusing and is not made easier by the depiction of characters like Moro, the large threatening white wolf who by design one would consider a male, but in actuality is the mother of San. It's an intricately woven tale and loyal fans of anime will find it spellbinding, though I must admit, for myself it took a concerted effort to follow and understand.","

Having put that out of the way, there are so many things included here, that even if you didn't know it was from Studio Ghibli, they have their way of telling stories, of animating them, of putting characters into them (and into peril). Mostly with a lot of innocence, but also a lot of violence too. They don't shy away from showing certain aspects of life (like death, the circle of life, with blood and all).So if you can bare that, the struggle is real and it is very well made.

Nonetheless I found myself watching it to find out what all the fuss was about.Initially, I found the film gripping. The old-fashioned animation felt fresh and I loved watching the colourful panoramas play out on screen. The early scenes involving the terrible forest monster chasing the film's hero were vivid and exciting; then Princess Mononoke is introduced.Gradually, I lost interest in the film. I found the story far too slim to support the lengthy running time. Myriad characters are introduced and underdeveloped, and the emphasis seems to be on repetitive action involving the different factions battling each other. Certain sequences are certainly captivating on the animation front - especially the huge, translucent forest god creature - but the story just didn't keep my attention.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","CinemaClown","3 May 2014","This was just... Wow. I'm still mesmerized by the incredibly dense cinematic experience this anime provided from start to finish & I'm still collecting my thoughts on it. Because Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke isn't just one of the strongest feature films put out by the artistic filmmaker or Studio Ghibli as a whole but is a landmark in the world of animation whose quality story, thematic elements & breathtaking on-screen execution makes regular animated flicks look like the works of amateurs.A period drama infused with elements of fantasy & set in early centuries of Japan, Princess Mononoke tells the tale of Ashitaka; a young prince who after saving his village from a rampaging boar-god/demon is stricken by a deadly curse & journeys to the forest of the West looking for an answer, only to find himself involved in the struggle between the supernatural guardians of the forest & the humans who are consuming its resources.The title refers to a young girl who was raised by the wolf-goddess & has a strong hatred for mankind. Written & directed by Hayao Miyazaki, Princess Mononoke is arguably the creative height of his illustrious film career & presents him in complete control of his craftsmanship. The 2D animation is absolutely dazzling, the supernatural creatures as well as forests are vividly imagined, the voice actors have done a fab job & music elegantly moves its story forward.The main theme this film deals with is the effects of industrialization on nature, deforestation & how it affects the species who've inhabited these places long before man's greed laid its eyes on their lands. On an overall scale, Princess Mononoke is an expertly crafted, deftly envisioned, gorgeously photographed, swiftly paced & masterfully composed work of art & entertainment which transcends the confines of animation with its complex story, strong characterization, adult themes & makes its statement heard rousingly clear.A standard of 2D animation, a treasure of world cinema, and arguably the pinnacle of Studio Ghibli's creativity, Princess Mononoke (Mononoke-hime) is strongly, extremely & one hundred percent recommended to each & every film lover around the world.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","crowrobot","15 October 2006","'Princess Mononoke' is, quite frankly, one of the greatest animated films of all time. It's a classic, filled with terrific, eye-popping imagery, complex characters, and it is truly powerful in its dramatic impact. I came close to tears by the film's end.The first thing you will notice about 'Mononoke' is the animation. Animation god Hayao Miyazaki fills his screen with lush colors and bizarre fantasy creatures (personal favorite: Ashitaka's deer/horse steed Yakul). It's a far cry from the increasingly cheap animation we have in America. The movie is ambitious in its scale, and there are some truly magnificent set-pieces, like the near-apocalyptic ending.Also of particular note is the story. These characters and this plot are not black-and-white. Lady Eboshi may be cutting down the forests and angering the gods, but she truly believes it will help her people; she shows compassion to outsiders like lepers and prostitutes, and her regret at Ashitaka's cursed arm is sincere (she did, after all, cause the boar god's madness). San, the ""Princess Mononoke"" of the title, has shades of gray, too: Yes, we sympathize with her desire to protect the forest, but she is not innocent of bloodshed. Even Jigo, a con man/priest who wants the Forest Spirit's head for the Emperor (which is obviously a bad idea), has his reasons for committing what may be considered ""evil"".The English voice cast has divided people, but I liked it. Billy Crudup brings gravity and stoicism to Ashitaka, and Claire Danes is appropriately fierce as San. The standouts, however, lie in the supporting cast. Minnie Driver is perfect as Eboshi, bringing wit and elegance to the role; Gillian Anderson breaks from her Scully persona to deliver a powerful performance as ancient wolf god Moro; Keith David, one of America's most underrated actors, rules as the boar god Okkoto, and Billy Bob Thornton is very funny as Jigo. Thornton's Southern drawl has caused controversy amongst fans, but I think it adds to the character's charm.'Princess Mononoke' is a masterpiece. To find a flaw in this movie is impossible.","

It also has some good insights about the culture and showing the important balance (or imbalance) between humans and Nature. It has some good lessons to learn here.

Quite an accomplishment. Although a fantasy, it addresses humanity's relationship with the natural world, and also the question of how we define good and bad.Even though this is an animated feature, it's not one for the tykes. Far from the ""cute"" stuff often found in US animated features, this movie depicts war and a number of gruesome scenes (also addressing karma and the loss of innocence). But even so, everything is in the movie for a reason, and it amounts to one fine picture.

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","goc6283","3 November 2014","Fun info: This is Miyazaki's first forgo into computer animation, used in the dark ""snakes"" near the beginning and a few other scenes and is also one of his most violent films. It also has a solid English dub.It concentrates on a different type of character than most of his films, a young man, Ashitaka, rather than a young woman. His quest does not change him like in many other films but rather he changes many others. The film leans just enough on environmental issues to show a cause while allowing the graphics and story you desire from a Miyazaki film. Special note to the soundtrack which is one Ghibli's best. It concentrates on an iron-works and the battle between various factions of humans, the beasts, and others.I don't plan on spoiling much else as the films plot speaks for itself. My only complaint is that certain scenes drag a bit too long and if anything a bit too much blood spills at a certain part of the film. Otherwise, this film is excellent and one of his best.9.5/10","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Jeremy-93","11 February 2003","If, like me, your heart sinks at the prospect of another pious, sanctimonious, tub-thumping eco-fable, give ""Mononoke Hime"" a chance all the same. It does have a distinct, and far from subtle, ecological message, of the ""can't we just live together?"" variety, but on the other hand it's far from clear that the answer the film suggests is ""yes"", and there are plenty of nuances and subtleties along the way. More to the point, there's a proper story, well-conceived and well told, there's a memorable, beautiful and violent world, credible characters and a good deal of charm.The animation is mostly very fluent and careful, though not flashy in the way we're getting used to in this CG age. (""Mononoke"" uses cgi, but subtly and with restraint, so that the feel remains that of a group of traditional craftsmen under one guiding hand). Quite often one finds that there are more static elements in a tableaux than you'd expect in a Disney animated feature, but I think this is an aesthetic choice rather than a mere economy: it stylizes and formalizes, while focussing attention on the important elements in the frame. But there is occasional jerkiness, though not enough to detract seriously, and perhaps it wouldn't trouble audiences whose frame of reference isn't so western as mine - I'm not sure.Talking of the western and eastern sensibilities, the Region 2 DVD which I'm reviewing gives you a choice of English and Japanese dialogue, and though I watched the American dub first, I'd generally prefer the Japanese version, for the key roles of Ashitaka and San. Billy Crudup is appealing but too low-key, and Clare Danes strikes me as badly miscast: she sounds a bit too old, and altogether too urban to bring out the core of wildness or the steely sense of loyalty to her world. Like other reviewers, I have trouble with the Texas drawl of Billy Bob Thornton, which is just too regionally specific to match the look of the character (please understand that I'm not suggesting the cast should all have done fake Japanese accents!). On the other hand, it's pretty much a toss-up between Yuko Tanaka and Minnie Driver (who's very closely attuned to the aesthetic of the original) as Eboshi, and Gillian Anderson and Jada Pinkett Smith are just right. Still, overall you get more vividness and conviction from the original voice cast.  Oddly, the lip-sync seems more approximate in the Japanese version, perhaps a fault in the synchronization on the R2 DVD.  The subtitles unfortunately but understandably come from Neil Gaiman's adaptation of the screenplay rather than re-translating the Japanese - one's aware, for example, that Gaiman has added bits of extra, explanatory dialogue.With all that out of the way, let's concentrate on what makes the film work: it delineates a world that's at once mythological and believable, and refuses to sentimentalize or simplify (even if it occasionally allows itself to preach).  There are feuds and failures of trust not just between the humans and the animals, but within each world - and the animals seem as ready as the humans to exclude the other from their world. Indeed the conceit of the film seems to be that language, rather than being a product of distinctly human evolution, was originally shared among mammals at least, and it's as the war with the humans goes on that the animal kingdom becomes more brutish and less coherent. For all the prince's idealism and the delicate rapprochement some of the characters inch towards, one gets the impression that the logic of conflict will be hard to resist.Perhaps the most appealing and intriguing element in this world is the kodoma: the little, voiceless tree-spirits seem to be a cross-between a mushroom, a toddler and a rattle, and I defy anyone not to be captivated by them.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","ElMaruecan82","26 June 2017","I saw ""Princess Mononoke"" twice the same weekend but I'm not sure I grasped half of what makes it such a great movie. Even 'great' is too vague a word; so many 'great' movies are not one-tenth the film ""Princess Mononoke"" in style, content and universal implications. Even after two viewings, I can only provide a superficial overview on the story and a meager but enthusiastic review of what constitutes one of the best animated movies of the last decades. To think that the same year, Disney came up with ""Hercules"" gives you an idea of where the real magic of animation operatedthanks to the most imaginative creator and most accomplished artist of his generation: Hayao Miyazaki. Indeed, imagination and artistry never got along so well since Walt Disney. Now, to the story.Although set in medieval Japan, ""Princess Mononoke"" ventures between the realms of history and fantasy, in a universe where the spirits of a God-like Nature govern the lives of (precisely) all living creatures: animals, plants and even men, they all coexisted in harmony until the age of deforestation. The film opens when a wild demonically possessed creature attacks the village of Ashitaka. And the tone is set from the start: the monster looks like a giant boar recovered by a sort of tentacles looking like writhing snakes, the drawing dwarfs any CGI abomination. You might as well compare a Rembrandt with a 4-year old kid's painting. The film was made in the late 1990's at the dawn of the CGI frenzy and when 3D animation would drive half the box-office grosses, but all the special effects of the world will never hold a candle to the power of hand-painting. ""Princess Mononoke"", the highest-grossing movie in Japan but soon-to-be dethroned by ""Titanic"", required a level of precision that couldn't do without traditional drawing. Miyazaki resorted to computer for a few hundred shots, only 1% of celluloid, but it says something about the man's pragmatism as he could also embrace technology to keep a fair balance between his stylish and narrative visions.And it works. When Ashitaka defeats the monster, everything looks real and the injury resulting from the fight doesn't have the contrivance of a 'magical' plot device. Ashitaka's arm is infected by a mysterious curse that will ultimately cause his death although giving him temporary superpowers (like decapitating someone with his a simple arrow shot). The village's wise woman tells him he must be exiled for his own good, to save his arm with the help of the Gods of the forests. Then starts the heroic and epic journey of the young Prince. From what I read, a few words were mistranslated, he's not actually a Prince and the girl who gives him the talisman isn't his sister, they're actually lovers. It doesn't undermine the comprehension of the story but it shows that the film is impregnated by Japanese culture and some idioms might be lost in translation. Even the title is misleading: Mononeke doesn't refer to the name of the Princess, but her status as a ""possessed monster or outcast"", this description, from human perspective, isn't objective but it reflects her status as someone between two worlds. Her real name is San and she was raised by the Goddess-wolf. San is like a counterpart to Ashitaka, both human protagonists deeply related to the animal world, one by choice and one by fate. While San resents humans for their destructive actions and their effects on animals (we'll learn later that the boar-demon was cursed by a bullet lodged in his body), Ashitaka is a collateral damage of men's actions but he's incapable of hatred, and empathize with both animals' and men's pleas. As usual with Miyazaki, this is not your typical ""good vs. evil"" story. The closest character to a villain is Lady Eboshi, the chief of Irontown, and she cuts trees to make iron and build the fortress where many social outcasts, ex-brothel workers and lepers work in exchange of food and protection. Eboshi has understandable motives and she's also a powerful woman respected by men and therefore, needing to assert her authority. Even the main antagonist, Jiko-bo, a sneaky monk, has a mission: taking the head of the Forest Spirit for the Emperor, he's like a government worker, so to speak. Ashitara is like the centerpiece of an arena where creatures struggle to find peace and harmony; even the Gods Animals are unequally pacific. The environmentalist statements aren't spoken at the expenses of realism. We do root for Nature and accept Miazaki's protection of environment but there's the idea of people defending their own interests, for their own survival. It's not realism, but lucidity. But lucidity doesn't undermine the dazzling visuals: the forest looks majestic, the wolves have that furry amplitude that shows how determined they are, and the magic displayed whether to convey a sense of danger or beauty is hypnotically beautiful. But that's only the tip of the iceberg, there's more to see in the film. Even the romance between San and Ashirata is handled with a sense of maturity that respects the coherence of the plot and our intelligence. ""Princess Mononoke"" surpasses everything Disney made in the last years before and everything Peter Jackson will make, CGI can look fine but you're always tempted to cheat with it, computer does the trick. There was a screen writing manual titled ""Save the Cat!"" and explaining how most movies, especially on the field of animation and fantasy / sci-fi journeys were based on the same structure. I dare anyone to find a usual pattern in ""Princess Mononoke"", this is a film that defies all the conventions and where every frame is original and surprising. To put it simply, ""Princess Mononoke"" is a great animated film with a great story, can you ask for more?","

Upon watching Princess Mononoke, I must say I first thought it would be very difficult to look past the animation style and see it for what it was- a dynamic film directed be the highly acclaimed Hayao Miyazaki. After about ten minutes of dwelling on the follies (and there are, in my opinion, many) of the ""anime"" style of art, I became enthralled with the quickly unfolding plot and the subsequently dire fate bestowed upon Ashitaka, the protagonist of the film. After Ashitaka leaves his village to search for a treatment to remedy his affliction, I no longer cared that this was an animated feature; I was on the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next. I no longer disliked that every character had abnormally large eyes (though not over-sized to the point of utter absurdity) or that the English overdubbing was a little choppy. In fact, I even began to enjoy the accomplished yet subtle computer generated effects interspersed throughout. By the last half hour I was hooked to the screen, eagerly awaiting the conclusion I wanted so badly to end the bitter conflict of the plot. By the end, I realized that this movie carried a powerful moral with it: man's continuous tampering with nature brings about as much savagery as it does progress, as much suffering as it does good, and that a sound compromise must be struck between nature and civilization. I do not harbor any negative feelings towards those who rated this movie poorly, as I used to be one of those people. All I have to say to them is this: look at a both the visual and symbolic attributes of a movie before rating it harshly. If, after observing all these features and idiosyncrasies, you still wholeheartedly hate the film, then by all means give it a one. After all, what would the world be like if we were all did not criticize or question our surroundings?","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Thanos_Alfie","27 January 2014","""Mononoke-hime"" is a movie which has to do with a quest of Ashitaka who tries to find the medicine for Tatarigami's curse, and in his effort he finds himself in a war between the forest gods and Tatara which is a mining colony. In his journey finds also the Mononoke Hime.I liked this movie because for one more time Hayao Miyazaki did a great job in the direction of it and as we can see in the movie his contribution is very big. And I believe that the success of this movie is a result of the Hayao Miyazaki's direction.Finally I have to tell you that I liked this movie very much as I also liked the other movies of Hayao Miyazaki such ""Spirited Away"", ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Howl's Moving Castle"". If you liked this kind of movies then you have to see this movie.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Spleen","14 June 2001","Disney animation has linear detail, economical drawing, and extremely sophisticated motion.  In a word, it's classical.  Japanese animation has vertical detail, heavily etched backdrops that verge on being overdesigned, but rudimentary motion.  Japanese animation is baroque.  (Disney cartoons tend to have better draftsmanship, but this is inessential to the difference in style.)  The styles could hardly be more fundamentally opposed, and you like either one or the other.  It's hard to have a strong taste for both. To lay my cards on the table, I like the Disney style: I consider it more subtle and versatile, and at its best it lives and breathes like no other kind of animated image.  Still, the Japanese style has its strengths.It's essentially a static art: silence and stillness are what it conveys best.  It's interesting to compare ""Mononoke"" with ""The Emperor's New Groove"".  The latter film is unusual for Disney in that silence and stillness are used with surprising frequency, but the effect is always unstable: stillness is a kind of dissonance, something requiring resolution. The moments of silence and stillness in ""Mononoke"" are consonant and complete in themselves.  There are some lovely static tableaux in which the dialogue - if there is any - has as much time as it needs to breathe.The Japanese style is also good at conveying a sense of place.  (Disney can do this also, but neither as quickly nor as economically.)  Usually it's an urban place.  Think of definitive anime, and most Westerners think of ""Akira"" and ""Ghost in the Shell"", which are very urban indeed.  (My personal favourite in the genre is ""The Crimson Pig"", which, if not quite so urban, is heavily technological.)  ""Mononoke"" is different.  Most of the action takes place in the untamed, and I mean untamed, wilderness; now and then we enter a village.  Surprisingly, even these settings are solidly realised.  A single drop of water falls from a pine tree and lands on someone's face, and at once we feel that we are in the middle of a dense, damp, green forest.The story is deeply weird, in the best Japanese tradition - in particular, in the tradition of this particular director - and intensely sad.  The hero's quest is fulfilled, in a sort of a way, but the film does not end in triumph.  Instead of thinking ""good, X happened"", we think, ""oh well, at least X happened"".  -I must admit I was surprisingly unmoved.  Something about ""Mononoke"" distanced me; it may have been the facelessness of the central hero, it may have been the overall style; if the latter, it may have been entirely my fault, which is why I'm unwilling to commit myself to any kind of criticism.  All I know is that, much as I admired parts of ""Mononoke"", I am unable to love it.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Movie_Muse_Reviews","28 January 2009","No one tells a more imaginative, original story than Hayao Miyazaki. While fantasy is a genre with limitless potential, there's still nothing like one of Miyazaki's animated fairy tales and ""Princess Mononoke"" is one his finest.The story follows a young warrior named Ashitaka who gets bitten and cursed by some sort of forest demon. The wound is surely fatal unless he embarks on a journey to find a cure. In his travels, he stumbles across a town of iron miners who are seemingly at war with wild animals, namely a pack of wolves and their princess, San. Ashitaka must try to play peacemaker as the forest's deer god--who both sides seek out for different reasons--might be his only means of a cure.The animation that brings a world of fantasy but also of feudal Japan to life is excellent. So many of the creatures are transparent, the large demons and gods are drawn of individual organism-like things that all move on their own while also making up a whole. The work must have taken forever. The nature backgrounds are also beautifully drawn. While most of the work and figures are in traditional anime style, the magical creatures will amaze you and the action is particularly well-directed to enhance the visual experience.""Princess Mononoke"" is a film for those who either have an appreciation of anime or more simply, an appreciation for imagination. Miyazaki's deer god sweeping through the land, his forest demons consuming people, Ashitaka's living scar, etc. are all things that simply inspire the imagination in everyone.While the film leaves its biggest impression as just a one-of-a-kind fairytale, there is some definite effort made to show that this battle between the humans and the wild animals is representative of man's struggle with nature. It is a fantastical dramatization of how we often upset the balance and harmony between the two. For people who have been exposed to nothing but Western film with Western ideas, this is quite a refreshing theme rooted in Buddhist philosophy and other Eastern religions, but certainly one all cultures can understand.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Vartiainen","23 November 2014","The magnum opus of director Hayao Miyazaki and one of the if not the best animation movie ever made. A film that children can watch no doubt, but which still deals with the themes of loss, sacrifice, the non-existent line between good and evil, war, death and the dying state of divinity and spirituality. It's a heavy movie, yet it's never so excessively dark and brutal that you couldn't show it to a twelve-year- old.For me, this is one of those perfect movies that you have the honour of coming across every once in a while. Because it's really hard to find any faults in this movie.The animation? Superb, mind-blowing, unbelievably beautiful from the very first shot of mountains covered in mist to the last shot of the great forest reaching for the heavens.The music? Haunting, soul-altering, beautiful beyond believe. The main theme has had a spot on my daily playlist ever since I saw this film.The characters? Magnificent. Detailed, fluidly animated, easily having more depth than most live-action characters ever created. I also love how this movie has no clear bad guys. The clash between the spirits of the forest and the civilization of man is the central focus of the film, but you very quickly realize that neither of those sides is in the wrong. They both have reasons for their actions, for defending what they see as theirs. The methods of both are at the same time commendable and questionable. Name one other movie where you've seen anything similar. I bet you have to think about it for a while.If you had to point fingers and say that those are the bad guys, you probably would go with the bounty hunters. But even they're rather likable as characters and are only doing what they're doing because it's their job. So yeah, not even them.And sure, the movie has flaws. No film has not. The eponymous Mononoke is not all that central to the conflict and is easily the most boring of the main characters. The deer god does look silly. Don't act like he doesn't. Other things like that. But they're all really minor. Nitpicks, if even that. Because the film is just that good.Princess Mononoke renews my hope for life every time I see it. It hasn't lost even a hint of its beauty, splendor and impact over the years. If you're ever going to see only one Japanese animation, see this one. Or Spirited Away.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","tedg","15 June 2001","Spoilers herein.The first thing I want is to be transported. The further the better, the more competently the better. This film transported me. It had quite a bit different take on the world -- heavihanded, confusing, illogical, juvenile mysticism, pop morality -- all different than what we are usually served up. Some of this strangeness (I am convinced) is because the director is a poor storyteller.Disney's ethic was that the simplicity in the art corresponded with a simplicity in the story, so much so that one could turn off the sound and get the story. Not just follow the story but follow the WHOLE story. Anime seems to want to turn that on its head, making the animation simpler than anything out of Disney, but blowing up the story complexity with so many threads that kids believe it is profound.No matter for me, the confusion and pseudodepth was part of the experience.But there is another element here, and that really did disappoint me. 'Akira' was genuinely artistic, not so much in the drawings themselves, but in the understanding of motion. I was impressed with how the edges on the screen corresponded to the edges between scenes. Akira had a similarly childish sense of the complexly profound, but the art showed mastery and self-awareness.The vision in this film is just plain unimaginative in how the motion is handled. I'm not talking about the quality of the animation (which is poor), but the depth of the art. And the images themselves lack imagination: a wormy boar as a demon; the nightwalker was straight out of scoobydoo; the wolfgods?; the smurfy sprites? None of this reaches deep.If you want an introduction to anime and are looking for art, go to 'Akira.' Don't even stop here.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","louis1011","10 July 2018","Princess Mononoke was on may radar for some time before I first saw it. Hearing that it was a 'Miyazaki master piece' but not really knowing what to expect. However as I started to watch the opening of the film I could tell from the amazing musical score and the breathtaking animation that I was watching a truly captivating film. As the story progresses you get a more three dimensional look at the characters in the film looking from all points of view seeing whats everyone wants. In particular you get a good look at the main character Ashitaka(voiced by Billy Crudup) as he tries to stop a conflict between San(voiced by Claire Danes) ,a girl raised by wolves, who is helping lead the wolves and other Forrest creatures up against Lady Eboshi(voiced by Minnie Driver) the Head of a village who are gradually destroying the Forrest for the resources the land has.Compared to other films Princess Mononoke should rank among the best animated films as it have a level of grandness that could only be matched by films like The Lord of the rings. Over the years this film has also been compared with other anime films however this film has a completely different tone to most of them as you don't get a shonin vibe or a high school romance. Overall I think that This one of Miyazaki's best films and probably one of the greatest animated films ever. That's why I'm giving it a 9/10","

While allot of his other films are PG or sometimes G. The animation and story line is very well made and planned out. I didn't see it in theaters when it came out in the US of 1999. I first heard of it at my Jr. high school, got the DVD of it later on when I learned more of Miyazkai's films. It's one of those films were at first it seem OK, but as you keep watching it it gets better every time it's viewed. Not in my personal favorites but it's definitely a fine piece of work by Miyazaki himself. I advice it to keep it away from younger viewers cause it's very violent. So it's suitable for like 13 and up.I give it 7.5/10","

The music was equally brilliant.I am surprised still that it hasn't been adapted into a live action movie, the story is a truly brilliant one, it's entertaining, moving, exciting, but it doesn't at any point preach at the viewer, it isn't heavy handed, but it does deliver a pretty big message.It's the perfect mix of art and entertainment, a few sequences make me think it's suitable more so for a mature adult, some scenes may be upsetting for younger children.In terms of the voices, I really liked Claire Danes and Gillian Anderson, I was a bit mixed with Billy Bob Thornton's voice, I'm not too sure it worked with his character.Overall, it was excellent.9/10.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Horst_In_Translation","27 June 2022","""Mononoke-hime"" or ""Princess Mononoke"" is a Japanese animated film from 1997, so this one has its 25th anniversary this year. I think this was not or at least not primarily the reason why it was shown again here at a local movie theater, but it was part of a film series with focus on anime. No big surprise because this is (considered) one of the classics. Writer and director is Hayao Miyazaki who is probably associated with anime movies more than anybody else. He was in his mid50s when he made this film and is over 80 now. I see there are quite a few talented American actors attached to this project and they were part of the English-language voice cast of course. This includes talented folks like Billy Bob Thornton, Billy Crudup and Gillian Anderson, but also less talented performers like Claire Danes or the absolutely unbearable Jada Pinkett Smith. Sad to see her as part of this project. I watched the Japanese original with subtitles, so I cannot elaborate in-depth on the international voice cast here, but the Japanese did fine overall. No more details there either because I am simply not familiar with their names. Most likely my loss. At almost two hours and fifteen minutes, this is a very long film for the genre. It could almost have been turned into a miniseries as well with this duration I guess and could have worked as well, no matter if there had been three or six episodes. You will not really find an equally long Studio Ghibli film. The awards recognition for this film was there, but surely less spectacular than it would have been nowadays where without a doubt it would have been one of the big animation players at the Oscars as well as at the Annies. The English-language version did not change anything about that either.One striking aspect about this film here was that it took quite some time until the title character really became a factor in this film, even appeared in this film. We see her briefly on one occasion when the main character runs into her, but there is not really any dialogue, just him screaming something at her and definitely the male protagonist here is more of a central character. But this is no exception when it comes to anime that they name the film after the most crucial female character, even if she does not have as much screen time as her male counterpart. I think it was an alright decision though. The longer the film goes, the more Mononoke moves to the center of it all, even if the guy also never disappears from the action. They are basically fighting together. And they also need each other. There are several situations when they save each other's lives pretty much. When one of them is unconscious. Honestly, I must say that, even if I did not expect a supernatural power warrior, I was a bit baffled by how Mononoke really got in miserable situations again and again, like also when she is trapped by her antagonists on one occasion and the male character helps here there again too and basically carries her out of the village. How did he get both women unconscious though at the same time? Anyway, this was also a bit of a critical situation because he is shot by one of the women from the village and it was a shot that not many would have survived, but he was clearly on a mission. There are some very supernatural aspects in here, but the two main characters are really as human as it gets. The title character may live with wolves in the forest, but she is still nothing but a human. The guy may be a very strong and dedicated fighter, but he is also not a deity or so. But he is able to take one on when he has to as we see at the very start with this really gigantic boar that comes to wreak havoc to his village. He manages to defeat it and we are informed on a few occasions that the boar was possessed by either a demon or an evil god. We even hear this creature's voice at the end when he leaves the corpse. Some very deep and gruesome voices you hear on a few occasions, also for example when other boars are talking or also when wolves are talking.One special thing about the forest is that the creatures living there are all pretty gigantic. At least the wolves and pigs are. Maybe the monkeys too, they are just side characters, but we see through them that the animals inside the forest are also not always getting along well and they have their conflicts that could even turn violent on some occasion, even if they eventually don't. Then there are two deer creatures, the pretty likable pet (if you can call it that) that belongs to the male protagonist and a really big and powerful deer that is the fleshly form (if you wanna call it that) of the forest god. Not a permanent form because he switches back and forth though and we see him also in his other more spirit-like form and we also get to witness the transition. And we get to witness what happens when said deity is attacked by a human tribe and literally loses his head to their aggression. That was a shocking moment. Maybe not the best idea to do that to a god and the consequences are massive as well. How he goes looking for his head and what happens to the forest at the same time. The ending is almost the now you could say. Green everywhere and the God is all over the place, but not really tangible anymore. There were mentions of said god deciding about life and death and I must say I am a bit curious how he did not kill the woman who did this to him. I will get to her in a second. For now, it can also be said that the male protagonist is not soft at all either. He also decapitates two people early on his journey that are about to commit crimes. Then there is the one who gives him advice that he should be careful when people are following him. Seemed like more of a comedic inclusion early on, but he is also a pretty (head)strong character as we find out quickly and somebody you should be very careful with. We understand this when he eventually returns.Now, as for the woman, I mentioned earlier, she was maybe not really less interesting than Mononoke. You could never be sure what was up with her. On several occasions, she seemed grateful towards the protagonist and not afraid to show it in front of her people, on the other she is a violent schemer who wants to conquer the world. She is not scared of killing forest creatures either. Basically, she goes there to kill the sacred deer even, the god of them all. In the end, she is more of a good character again when after her and her people's home got destroyed she says they will rebuild it. She also supports people with severe deformations and they themselves tell another character (and us) that nobody else except her ever really took care of them and gave them a decent life. Of course, this is also for her to move forward with her gruesome dreams, but still. She is probably also a bit of a feminist if you take a look at how she sometimes speaks about men or also how she paid to free these women, all the female villagers basically, from their prostitution backgrounds. The only thing you can surely say about her is that you can never really be sure with anything she was doing. Seeing her basically as the main opponent to Mononoke is something that also contributed to seeing her as the biggest villain here. But as I stated, there is a lot more to her. Some stuff also confused me, like I have no idea why she was heading to the forest with her men instead of staying with her ""army"" back in the village to protect the place when other enemies were potentially approaching. Instead she was heading out for a fight against nature and took her best men with her of course. She was also a gifted fighter herself as we see, on par with Mononoke. As for the latter, it's a really cool character and I enjoyed watching her for sure, but I still felt her story as well as the film's overall story sometimes tried to be a bit too much for the film's own good, so I cannot really share the overwhelming praise this film has received and also that it is inside the imdb top250. You can see that from my rating. I liked the watch, but not more and I am generally somebody who digs a good environental message and story and this film has a lot to offer in this department.Where it does not have a lot to offer is the comedy. Most anime films, also the older ones, deliver quite a few moments where the audience can laugh, but here these are almost not existent. Maybe you can make a case for the moments relatively early with how the village women are reacting towards the main character and also how they are reacting towards their men on the other hand, but that is really almost it. I guess they kept it serious throughout because Miyazaki did not want to take anything away from the dramatic plot overall and just have the audience focus entirely on ths seriousness of this film. All in all, the characters and the magic of it all are on a level where it is a decent watch for the entire family, also children, but pay attention again to how heads are severed here, also human ones, even if it can be seen very briefly only. I do like the poster here on imdb. Mononoke's somewhat indigenous mask is really cool and I wish we could have seen her wear it on more occasions. Her make-up underneath is fine too though. That is all then. Maybe this is a film that will impress me more on rewatch and I will perhaps see it again at some point, but not anytime soon. As of now, I would say that I found the animals and magic creatures there in the forest really far more interesting than the humans. I must also totally mention those little forest spirits that were so cool with the sounds they were making. There were so many of them, even if when introduced the one we see seemed like a rarity early on. I liked that the film ends with one of those too in the final shot. Pretty cool and I like the idea that our forests are full with these too. Okay, a lot of brainstorming from me in here, but I hope you got the essence. Thumbs-up for this film here.","

I haven't seen the original with Japanese voice actors, but I quite liked the English voice cast. At least they sounded like they were interested in doing their jobs and they did it quite nicely.'Princess Mononoke' is a rare gem of animation, aimed towards a bit more mature audience than your average Dinsey films, that while keeps you thrilled whit the beautiful writing and well fleshed out characters, it also gives you something to think about. It can be seen as a statement of how industrialization is good for people in the short term, but how it will eventually turn the surroundings around us, thus destroying the legacy of later generations to come.While many other animations will wither in time, I'm sure that 'Princess Mononoke' will be remembered as one of the classics of animation throughout the time.","

The animation and story are excellent as one would expect from a Hayao Miyazaki film. Be warned however that this film isn't as gentle as his other films, we see several people having their heads and limbs removed although this is not shown in graphic close-up.I liked the fact that the conflict between the villagers and the forest creatures wasn't depicted as a clear cut case of good versus bad and like most of Miyazaki's films it has strong female characters that are neither damsels in distress nor trying to marry their Prince Charming like many western animated heroines.The film opens with a possessed giant boar thundering out of the forest and attacking a village. The boar is slain by Prince Ashitake but not before it wounds him. He is told that the found is part of a curse that will ultimately kill him if he doesn't leave his village and seek out the Deer God in forests far to the west.When he gets there he finds the forest creatures in conflict with the inhabitants of a village who are clearing areas of forest to find ore for their iron works. It turns out that Lady Eboshi, the leader of the village, had fired the shot that had caused the boar to be cursed. She is not a typical film villain though as she is very protective of her village and employs former prostitutes and lepers who wouldn't be treated so well elsewhere.Fighting against her is San (Princess Mononoke) a girl that has been raised by the Wolf goddess Moro in the forest and despises humans, and various forest creatures. When she attacks the iron works in a plan to kill Lady Eboshi, Ashitake intervenes to stop them killing each other. As he is taking San out of the village he is seriously wounded but she takes him to the deer god who cures this wound but not the curse.As well as these protagonist there is Jigo who has been employed my the emperor to bring back the head of the deer god as he believe it will give him the power over life and death.I can't comment on the quality of the English dubbing as I've only watched the subtitled version so far.","

Basically a possessed boar tries to attack a small village, and as the one who defeated him, the creature infects young Ashitaka (Billy Crudup) with an incurable disease. The only way eh may be able to cure his curse is to travel far east and find either the deer God, who makes all plant life grow, or Princess Mononoke, aka San (Claire Danes), raised by wolf Gods and leading the forest animals in the war. Ashitaka is also trying to intervene with the war between the forest and mining colony Tataraba, as they fight for freedom and resources, with all sorts of weird and wonderful characters, creatures, spirits and Gods getting involved. Also starring Gillian Anderson as Moro, Minnie Driver as Lady Eboshi, Jada Pinkett Smith as Toki, Billy Bob Thornton as Jigo, Keith David as Okkoto and Futurama's John Di Maggio as Gonza.

I really, really wanted to like this film more than I did. I am a big fan of Miyazaki and this is supposed to be his masterpiece, but I'm just not able to go that far in my own assessment of it. It was complex, and beautifully animated (as you expect from Miyazaki), but it left me a bit hollow. Part of it was the incredible violence in the film (NOT for children under 13, IMO), and part of it was hearing Billy Bob Thornton's drawl as the voice of Jigo, but a big part of my reluctance to rate this film more highly is that it felt a bit like Miyazaki was reaching for something that he had already grasped. I think he addressed almost identical themes in a much better way in Nausicaa. Princess Mononoke seemed uncharacteristically ""preachy"" and heavy-handed, in contrast with Miyazaki's generally subtle style. I know it's super popular and has a stellar reputation, but I just can't recommend it when there are so many other great works available from this true Artist of Anime.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","action-6","25 February 2004","""Princess Mononoke"" is a beautiful anime from the one and only Hayao Miyazaki. This is a superb movie with great characters, wonderful animation and music and it also has many important messages for its audience. Characters are not like your black-and-white disney-like stereotype where all the characters are as good or as evil as they can possibly be. No, all characters found here appear to be more like a human being, where everyone possess good as well as evil qualities.  Philosophy also plays an important part here, where one of the movie`s strongest themes is mankind`s relationship with nature. Miyazaki delivers once again a mesmerizing tale that possess both the power to entertain but also to make us think about our role in the world.10/10","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","neil-476","11 December 2011","Princess Mononoke, like most of Studio Ghibli's output, has a Japanese sensibility which is quite alien to a western audience which has grown up on Disney and Looney Tunes. The story hardly matters - the striking visuals rule.The story is perfectly fine, though: its vague ecological message survives the other-wordly weirdness of demons, forest gods, and warring factions kept apart by a pair of unlikely peace brokers.But it looks terrific - character design, backgrounds and animation are all first rate. And its weirdness is part of its appeal. There's no guarantee that you will enjoy it but, if you give it a chance, there is a lot to enjoy here.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","morrison-dylan-fan","5 February 2014","For the first (and thankfully up to now,only time) time ever,I found myself in 2009 becoming completely disinterested in seeing films/TV shows,listening to new music and reading fiction novels,due to none of them really connecting with me at that point in time.Searching round for some DVD's to pick up for a friends birthday in late 2009 at a local HMV,I found myself strangely taken by the cover of a Japanamation title. With having never heard of the film before,I was caught by surprise,when I started to get a strong feeling that I had to pick up the DVD right away.Watching the DVD later that night,I found myself being left breathless by writer/director Hayao Miyazaki's complex,yet human plot,and also Studio Ghibli's, (the studio which Miyazaki founded) animation work being unlike anything that I had seen before.As I started to gather up titles to celebrate my upcoming 500th IMDb review,I decided that my 500th review would be the perfect time for me to take a look at my 5th favourite film of all time,which led to me excitingly getting ready for a very special meeting with Princess Mononoke.View on the film:Giving an intelligent cultural context in a narration adaptation by Neil Gaiman,each of the cast (in the English version) members give passionate performances,with Billy Bob Thornton giving the movie a soulful side as Jigo,and Billy Crudup brilliantly expressing Ashitaka's conflicting emotions on the deadly situation that he finds himself in.Joining the guys,Minnie Driver keeps away from giving Lady Eboshi a heart of iron by giving her a firm,but protective voice,with almost all of Eboshi's activates being linked to her wanting to do the best for the people of Iron Town.Perfectly matching her character design,Claire Danes gives a wild performance as San,with Danes showing the survival of the gods to be the thing that drives San's existence,whilst Gillian Anderson gives the film a meditating side,as the voice of the wolf god Moro.Personally drawing (or redrawing) 80,000 of the titles 144,000 animation cells,writer/directing auteur Hayao Miyazaki gives the last ever title to be filmed on plastic cells an astonishing send off. Showing no fear at all in making the movie mature,Miyazaki superbly gives each of the demonic gods a raw visceral edge by allowing blood to flow from every hole of their decaying bodies,with Miyazaki also showing a real eye for tough action scenes,as Ashitaka uses his demon powers to chop peoples arms off,and for decapitations.Contrasting the gory edges of the action scenes,Miyazaki shows an extraordinary eye for detail,with ever branch and leaf in the forest being individually drawn to beautiful detail that, gives the film a powerful Fantasy atmosphere,with Miyazaki also making the characters brilliantly fully dimensional, by allowing for all of their positive's and flaws to be expressed across their faces.Avoiding the risk of the screenplay becoming preachy,Miyazaki makes the environment issue one that is focused on the characters effects on the location,and not on the location itself. Keeping away from making Eboshi a boo-hiss villain,Miyazaki shows,that whilst Eboshi's battles are extreme,that they are firmly rooted to Eboshi wanting to make the residents of Iron Town's lives better.Giving Ashitaka an infection from the start,Miyazaki shows Ashitaka fight against his infection by developing a maturity in his complicated relationship with San,and also taking on the townsfolk and the woodland residence with an unwavering sense of determination,as Miyazaki reveals his Princess to be an unforgettable film.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Red-Barracuda","21 November 2014","Animals, their gods and humans clash in this fantasy adventure from famed Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki. Consequently, nature vs humanity is a strong theme throughout Princess Mononoke, meaning that this is an animated movie with a definite message. Most of the humans, after all, are from a mining village who rape the earth, while the sympathetic people are Ashitaka, a boy who fights to bring peaceful co-existence between the opposing forces and Princess Mononoke who actively sides with the animal world and lives amongst them. It's quite clear, therefore, where the film's sympathies lie, although the ecological message is never delivered in a trite obvious manner and there are many shades of grey throughout.The tone overall is decidedly more mature than most animation and is one of the films from Studio Ghibli that goes for an older adult audience as opposed to the usual family friendly one. It's even quite violent in places, including several decapitations. But irrespective of the darker material it resembles Ghibli anime quite clearly. In any case this renowned animation studio had already released adult fare beforehand, anyone who has seen the harrowing Grave of the Fireflies will understand this. But in terms of visual artistry Princess Mononoke fits right in to the whole Ghibli cannon perfectly. In fact, this one has to be one of their greatest achievements on this front. The forest scenery is stunningly rendered and the invented creatures are consistently interesting. Of note are the wild boars, the night monkeys and the wolf god Moror but most spectacular of all is the deer-like god Shishigami - the colossal nightwalker. This latter being stalks the land in the twilight and generates a strange atmosphere and ambiance all of its own. The scenes towards the end involving it, illustrate the sheer imagination that Ghibli is famed for. The plot-line is not especially great if I am honest but it allows for the film to cover its themes successfully, while integrating them into a wonderfully rendered fantasy world. Like all Ghibli, it benefits considerably too from evolving unashamedly and organically from Japanese culture and mythology; this ensures that from a western perspective, it consistently remains unpredictable and fascinating.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","cherold","2 August 2005","I was a little startled by Princess Mononoke. Having seen Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle and heard their director Miyazaki referred to as Japan's answer to Walt Disney, I wasn't expecting the considerable violence of this movie. It was suited the movie's story and themes certainly, but it sure startled me.But if you're not looking for a Disney flick, this is one impressive and wildly imaginative movie. Many scenes are absolutely amazing, and the last half hour is truly stunning.The attitude of the movie is very interesting. This is basically technology vs. Nature, but even though the film's sympathies lie more with living with nature, the technology side is not portrayed as evil but instead for the most part as good people with a different world view. The absence of black and white thinking in films is rare and always appreciated.While my favorite Miyazaki films will always be the more genial ones like Totoro and Spirited Away, this is still a must-watch movie.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","emryse","13 September 2022","This feels like a back to basics for Miyazaki, his second film (Nausicaa in the Valley of the Wind) was in a wholly original world but the following few were all our world with a touch of magic. Here the world is full of strange creatures, giant boars, deer with the face of god knows what and weird demon monkeys. This film descends into some pretty trippy stuff. Sadly while these weird creatures are fun I think going whole-hog (pun intended) with the fantasy ends up with us losing out on some of the more intimate human elements and small character interactions. They are still present but not as numerous as in his other works which is a shame.The animation is as always delightful, every subsequent film he makes, the animation just gets better and better. The creature and costume designs here shine through as otherworldly, the star being the spirit of the forest. It's difficult to describe but it's a bit like a deer crossed with a baboon. The main protagonist, Ashitaka is likeable, San, the wolf girl, is fine but it didn't feel like I knew enough about her to become attached. My favourite character was this weird ugly short fella, Jiko-bo. At points it's unclear what he's trying to do or why but he's funny to look at which is enough to please my simple brain.This film is good, but for me it never quite lands the with the same punch that films like Totoro, or Kiki's Delivery Service do. This film feels like an attempt at a slightly more grown up tale, showing us blood (surprisingly) and war, and while it's central message of looking after the environment is good. I think this is one of Miyazaki's weaker films.","

Animation is excellent, directing is well done, scenes are epic, characters well developed, voice acting is spot on for dubbed. There's a sense of tension nearly throughout the film, drawing the viewer into this incredible, weird world that looks strangely familiar. Some comical elements thrown in for fun to break up the heavy theme.Despite all the fantastic studio work and bang-up start, it seems the story & writing begin to unravel a bit, wandering, getting lost in the woods. I've seen the film a pair of times, and the end seems to finish with a shrug. It may be a commentary on the reality of mankind and nature, but needed some kind of anchor or point to making the film for it to earn a re-watchable rating.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","ace-150","11 December 2005","This is a sophisticated film with complex cultural, political and personal themes which just happens to be animated. As in real life, each character has parts that you love and parts that you hate. Ashitaka's impassivity in the face of his fate seems beautiful and noble at the beginning of the film but becomes frustrating, even enraging at the end. Eboshi destroys nature to rescue humans on the brink of destruction. Nobody apologizes for their bias, just like in life. Some critics have accused the plot of being driven by the stupidity of the characters, but this critique holds them to the standards of current US society. Nineteenth century Japan was a society strictly regulated by traditions, traditions that were being threatened by Western incursions into Japan. The characters act the only way that they can act - they do their best in an incomprehensible, unsolvable situation. Personally, I sided with Mononoke, but Ashitaka acts with honor in every situation that he faces. I hope that I would have his inner strength in the face of such problems. Things are not neatly wrapped up at the end. This is only one battle in the war between burgeoning Japanese industry and the ancient gods. The war still rages on in Japan as it does in the United States. Oh, the animation is superb. And, for goodness sake, watch it in Japanese with subtitles. If you watch the English version, you won't see the movie the way that it's intended.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","caseyt-48511","9 April 2019","I have a long history with this movie. When I was about 7 I caught it on tv late at night and was interested but didn't know what was happening. I was traumatized by the violence and scary images. I legitimately had nightmares! So I avoided this movie for years. But, nearly 15 years later and I am a big Studio Ghibli fan. I knew I had to watch it. I was not disappointed.
The story of the movie has the feel of a Tolkien epic. A prince goes on a journey to lift a curse off of him. He meets spirits, gods, a town of outcasts and more. The plot is brilliantly put together and tight. There is no wasted moment. The characters are all well written and developed. There's a lot of ambiguity in the film. No character is a stock character and their motives could be easily commended or condemned. I think this leaves the viewer to interpret how they feel.
The animation is so beautiful. Over 100,000 drawings were used in the film. It's colorful, vibrant and feels alive. It screams animated masterpiece.
There's something about Ghibli films that give you a certain feeling. Kinda like what you get when you watch a great classic Disney film. I can't quite put my finger on what the feeling is. Not quite nostalgic, but it's a good feeling nonetheless.
There's so much to talk about. If you love Japanese animation, or just animation in general, then this is a must see! Be warned though! This can be a very violent movie. If you want your younger kids to see a Ghibli film then try My Neighbor Totoro or Ponyo. But once their older, show them this film. Believe me, it's worth every moment.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","SnoopyStyle","18 June 2015","In feudal Japan, Ashitaka protects his village and kills an attacking demon boar. Part of the curse infects his arm. Village elder tells him to travel west to find a cure and encounters a monk who tells him about the great forest spirit. In Irontown, he finds leader Lady Eboshi who freed girls from the brothels and trying to perfect her guns. She is cutting down the forest and killing its animals. Her holy grail is to cut off the head of the forest spirit. She is opposed by animals of the forest and Princess Mononoke who was raised by wolves.I really like the spirits of the forest. I wonder if the movie needs a true villain. Lady Eboshi is more of a Captain Ahab character. The conflict doesn't have the same punch. The other main problem is the clunky dubbed dialog. It really takes work to make the dialog sound natural and not just simple translations. Overall, this has some great imaginative concepts and spirits. This is a special animated movie.","

Do not watch in English unless you want to watch with with kids under the age of 10 (well, when I was 10 I was already watching everything subtitled, people should not be afraid of subtitles).The most powerful experience I ever had watching anything (be either a film, a TV series, theater or a show) was the second time that I watched this film. The first time I didn't really give respect this film deserves (I though it was a childish cartoon and I watching it for a guilty pleasure) and actually failed to really get it. After watching several other movies I remembered this film and I noticed it was truly better than anything else I had watched lately, so I decided to watch it again, this time really paying attention to it: The first few minutes were already better than the last five films I had watched put together. When it ended I cried and was unable to sleep for 5-6 hours, thinking about how freaking awesome this film was.This film features the most powerful score ever. I would call it truly a heavy score, like Black Sabbath, but more epic and without distortion. Most film scores are just background noise that serves to convey emotion, but here the score has a life of its own. Indeed, the score alone makes this film better than 90% of all other movies.Edit: Today a viewed this film for the third time. It became BETTER than the second time. I also viewed 2001: A Space Odyssey for the third time in the same day, and this film totally destroyed 2001 and I consider 2001 one of the best films ever made, but this film made it look like an episode of Family Guy by comparison.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","pmcollectorboy","23 September 2000","Okay. I'm not a big anime fan. I can't stand the ones that look like Dragon Ball Z. I despise the ones that look like Ghost in the Shell. Pokemon is silly. Sailor Moon turned stupid. And so far, the only show that looks decent is Escaflowne. And Pokemon the Movie was the worst animated movie I've ever seen. I didn't even bother seeing the sequel. I was also slightly disappointed by Grave of the Fireflies. But this. This is something else. This is something magical. It's probably the only anime movie worth watching, although I could be wrong. First the positives. The characters are realistic and well developed. There are no true ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"". The story is also great, sometimes sophisticated. Although the premise has been done to death, this is more than just your average environment movie. Finally, there's the animation. It's beautiful and breathtaking, especially with the backgrounds. The Nightwalker sequence is probably the one of the better animated pieces in history. Now the negatives. While the movie is wonderful to look at, the animation technique is still anime, which drives me crazy to no end. Those used to Disney's fluid style of drawing and animating will find the hyperactivity and shortcuts of anime a tad unrealistic and maybe even cartoonish. The movie also tries to do too many things at once, and as a result, certain parts look unfinished, rushed, or unpolished. Some parts even seem unnecessary. Finally there's the ending. Do all animes end in a wimpy, ambiguous note? Because I'm not used to it. These flaws aren't enough to make it a bad movie. On the contrary, this is a fantastic movie. However, this won't receive a perfect 10 from me, just a 9.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","steve.schonberger","29 November 1999","Princess Mononoke is stunningly beautiful art, with wondrous detail in nearly every scene. The animation is rich and imaginative; the demon forms and the forest god's ""night walker"" form are images I've never seen before, and the forest scenes are full of beauty and wonder. The sometimes-gory violence isn't just mindless action; one can almost feel the pain of characters when they are injured. Even the dubbed English (the only version I've seen) script is matched fairly well to the original lip movements. The voice actors are good or excellent, particularly Minnie Driver (Lady Eboshi), Billie Crudup (Ashitaka), and Jada Pinkett (Toki, a smaller part). Finally, the story is deep and thoroughly involving.The depth of the plot is shown in the way the many factions act. Each contends for its own interests, rather than for an abstract cause of good or evil. Most believe their own cause to be good, and opposing interests to be the enemy; each shows goodness and flaws.In the simplest view, the conflict is between the Lady Eboshi's industrial Iron Town and the gods and animals of the forest. But there are more factions in conflict than just those two.The remainder, except the final paragraph, includes possible minor spoilers.In the introduction, Ashitaka fights a demon -- a god driven to madness by pain and hate. He kills it, at the cost of a curse that will slowly kill him. He chooses permanent exile from his home, the dying idyllic Emishi civilization (elsewhere thought to be long dead). He sets out on his quest with a heart unclouded by hate, in hope of the possibility that the curse might be overcome.He travels West to the source of the conflict that turned the god into a demon, and learns of the numerous factions in the conflict. One major side is the Forest, with its gods and animals, divided into a number of factions. The other major side is the humans, also divided into several factions, most in conflict with the Forest.The Forest is united in its desire to prevent destruction by human encroachment, but divided into factions with different ideas of how to protect their world. The boars favor a frontal assault, to kill the humans or die trying, even though they're somewhat aware that they're more likely to die trying. The monkeys favor a defensive approach, replanting the forest and killing humans opportunistically. The wolves -- including San, the Princess Mononoke -- understand the humans' strength from fighting them, and hate them, but urge caution in fighting such a dangerous enemy. Finally, there are the Forest Spirit and the Kodamas, whose motivations are deep and mysterious.The humans are divided also. Lady Eboshi and her Iron Town are the main human faction. Eboshi is loved by her people, who include outcasts from other human societies: former prostitutes whose freedom she has bought and lepers she has taken in. Instead of conventional women's clothing, she wears a man's pirate coat. A minor faction is the samurai, who seek Lady Eboshi's iron. Another human faction is the monk Jigo, who befriends Ashitaka but seeks (with his hunters) the mountain of gold the emperor has promised to anyone who can bring him the forest's secret of immortality.Finally, there is Ashitaka, who starts out with his own agenda, to overcome his fatal curse. Along the way, he learns to see the good in both the Forest and Iron Town. He becomes a friend of them both, and looks for a solution that allows both of his new friends to survive, while continuing to hope for a cure to his curse.Few movies have this much depth of plot detail. The story is deeply involving, and takes many unexpected paths. The art is beautiful, wonderfully imaginative, and moving. The animation and voices are well done. I could find no flaws. This is one of the best movies ever.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","twofold420","2 March 2008","I haven't seen this movie in a long time, but I still stand by my choice as this being the best film of the 1990s (that I saw anyway). This was simply the most stunning and beautiful animation I have ever seen. Disney wishes they can make a movie that looks this good. From the opening scene in Ashitaka's village to the forest of the gods, and even the factories of Iron Town, Miyazaki never lets up on creating a wonderful piece of cinematic beauty (He drew over half the frames himself). Also his attention to detail with how the rain falls and hits the ground, how characters move and talk, and flies buzzing in the background. Hell, live action movies wish they could do something this good.All that is worth two hours of your time, but now we add a complex story where there are no good guys and bad guys just people. There is a lot of action in this film which is unusual for a Miyazaki film, but the plot calls for it, and it doesn't detract from the character development. Each character is well defined and has real depth. The screenplay is powerful and emotional. Most live action films can't achieve the complexity of Princess Mononoke, and it would have to be even harder for animation to convey real life feelings, but as I watched it, the script and beauty kept drawing me in further and further.The voice acting was OK for the US version, and outstanding for the Japanese version. Billy Bob Thorton was completely wrong for any part of this movie (a southern accent in Japan?). The other American voices were all adequate. Interesting note, the voice for the wolf god that Gillian Anderson does was done by a male for the Japanese version. The music was as breathtaking as the animation, and was a perfect match, especially at the end during the restoration scene. This is one of the best musical scores I ever heard, and I'm surprised it didn't get the recognition it deserved. Anyways, the song (Japanese, not American) was also beautiful. 10/10 for both US and Japanese versions, but watch the Japanese version if you can.","

I wasn't sure what was going on, and who was this movie about again, who is this ""Mononoke Hime"". But as I watched this movie over and over again, the plot started opening, and I began to understand and realize things I didn't notice before. I have always loved the way Miyazaki draws his characters expressions. Unlike some other anime movies I've seen, Miyazakis characters are more easier to read. And this is where the difference of reality and cartoons steps in. Its easy to overdo your characters expressions, and so spoil the movie, and make it look stupid, even childish. This isn't a mistake that Miyazaki would do. A big bonus for that!Mononkoe Hime surpasses even the famous ""Nausicaa, the valley of the wind"". Im totally impressed!","

It was so much more beautiful then the Disney/Pixar movies. After i had seen Spirited Away i tried frantically to find Princess Mononoke on the internet.Princess Mononoke is a story about a prince named Ashitaka. He goes on a journey to find a cure for Tatarigami's curse. On the journey he finds himself in the middle of a war between a human Iron-town and the gods of the woods. He also meets Princess Mononoke, a girl who is raised by wolves and is filled with hate against humans.I think Princess Mononoke was even better than Spirited Away. It outclasses its Hollywood-synonym, Lord Of The Rings. The plot is very good. The soundtrack is amazing, it's a shame that the Academy Award didn't notice it. The animation is beautiful, especially the characters. The only thing i can complain about is the English dubbing. Billy Crudup does a splendid job as the voice of Ashitaka, but they could really have chosen a better alternative than Billy Bob Thornton as Jigo.Overall i give this movie 9 out of 10.","

For the protection of his kin and in order to revert this process, he leaves on a journey. He finds a young woman running a lead mill crafting rifles, with ambitions of rule and no care for the damage she does to nature(and he is suffering some of the consequences). And thus we get the not-so-subtle message(hint: she represents mankind). ""Can't we all just get along"" is the idea, but it does actually take the problem more seriously(with a mature sensibility) than other of these, such as Dances With Wolves, Pocahontas, and most recently, Avatar. This also gets into the theme of anger and hate being self-destructive, not only harmful to one's surroundings. There are a lot of concepts in this, and fully comprehending and following it may require several viewings, time devoted to piecing it all together, and prior knowledge and understanding of Japanese culture. This is not for children, or even teens, but adults, setting it apart from every other Miyazaki production I've seen, which is nearly all of them. The acting is very good, and I urge you to watch this with subtitles, not dubbed. I do wonder why they did not sync up the animals, unlike the humans. The animation is excellent, with memorable designs, and mood expertly built by, among other things, the right amount(and tone, nuance) of light and dark(it also knows when and how to use sound, as well as silence). There is a bit of action, and it's intense, visually appealing and well-choreographed. Sans credits, this is 124 minutes long. The DVD comes with trailers for Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbour Totoro, Porco Rosso, Ponyo, this and Howl's Moving Castle, 2 Promos(coming to a running time of 8 minutes), 3 teasers(2 minutes put together) and 6 TV spots(totaling at 2 minutes). There is a lot of disturbing content, and, what seems somewhat gratuitous, a little violence, blood, gore and hints of sexuality.

His travels lead him to the unscrupulous ""Lady Eboshi"" who has developed a smelting process that enables her to make guns - giving her not only advantage against the other local clans, but also helping her on her quest to kill the gods and the wolves lead by the Princess Mononoke whom they have raised from infancy. The story is great, the colourful and detailed animation moves the fable along well and excitingly with plenty of solid characterisation and action a-plenty. As ever with Miyazaki, there is a moral to the story - and the last twenty minutes exemplify that beautifully. The English language dubbed version has a good cast injecting personality and an extra degree of emotion to the characters too. I did find the forest sprites just a bit too twee, but otherwise this is a great marriage of creativity and legend - and I really enjoyed it.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","FilmCreature","9 July 2007","The first time I saw this movie, I was going to give it a 9/10, but now that I have watched it several more times, I see the epic scale of it all. The animation is just beautiful. Wondrous. Hayao Miyazaki is a genius. I love the story, it's like an ancient tale told through the ages.The story begins with Ashitaka (voiced by Billy Crudup) battling a giant demon. It turns out to be a huge boar covered with black, evil worm-like creatures. Some of the creatures wrap themselves around Ashitaka's arm, and he is infected. ""Though you cannot change your fate,"" he is told by the village wise woman, ""you may rise to meet it."" So Ashitaka begins a journey to be cured of this infection by the mysterious forest spirit, a glorious creature you must see for yourself. Along the way, he battles samurai and makes a stop in Irontown, ruled by the ruthless Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver), and encounters a monk named Jigo, who gives him advice and is friendly towards him. For now.This movie is a fantastic animated masterpiece, as beautiful as Spirited Away in story, and even more beautiful in its epic animation.4/4","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","gbill-74877","25 April 2021","There's so much to love about this Studio Ghibli production, with its beautiful animation and messages of environmentalism and co-existence. It starts off seeming like it will be another fantasy involving a young man going off to fight essentially as good vs. Evil, but we soon see it's not as simple as that. In fact, the character is more often a mediator, so much in the middle that others wonder whose side he's on, which I thought was a nice touch. There are two strong female characters on each side of the conflict, and I loved the nuance in that of Lady Eboshi, the leader of an iron works. She rescues girls from slavery and gives lepers jobs, seemingly a virtuous character defending her operation from the animals which threaten it, but we find that she's also ambitious and her campaign of deforestation is done with ultimate goal of power. She's doing what people do but it's destroying the ecosystem, which is then reacting. Meanwhile there are conflicts within both sides, e.g. Samurai vs. Ironworkers, and apes vs. Wolves vs. Boars. That makes the plot probably a little messier than it should have been, and a film with more action scenes (and associated carnage) than necessary, but it underscores the message that conflict is inevitable, and that mediation is critical to allow both sides to live in harmony. It's all wrapped up in creative visuals done with a wonderful aesthetic, making for an appealing film.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Pjtaylor-96-138044","24 March 2020","'Princess Mononoke (1997)' is a story about humans vs nature, an age-old struggle here categorised by a literal war, that tries to implore a balance between the two intrinsically linked elements but never feels as though it's 'preaching'. The piece works as an epic adventure regardless of its real-life relevancy, chock-full of Studio Ghibli's signature strangeness and odd underlying charm. It's much more serious than the studio's usual stuff, though. Its beautiful animation is as often used to evoke fear as wonder, the piece being surprisingly heavy - and violent - for a 'PG' animated piece. This isn't a bad thing, depending on who you are, because it allows for a mature yet enjoyable tale. The thing is rich and exciting, building towards a genuinely tense finale. Its characters are also rather multi-faceted, never quite conforming to the expectation of their role. It's a really solid story with some great action, resonant themes and interesting animation. It's probably Miyazaki's finest work. 8/10","

This movie is a stunning clash of positive and negative aspects. It's basically blockbuster syndrome where the whole thing looks and sounds stunning but upon closer examination is pretty shallow.Basically everything about this movie is amazing but its script. Visually stunning with its lush setting coming up against the forces of modernity. The sparing but startling usage of CGI to represent the unholy. The mood, switching from epic battle of man and crazed demon to quite reflection as a stone gets speckled in rain. It ebbs and flows from peaceful to fiery that is hypnotic and compelling. The score will be your new guilty pleasure too.I've seen both the original and English dub. It was back at a time where I struggled to rarely take notice of voice performance when I was reading, but the English dub is fine. It's a mix of tolerable performances (like Mononoke and the main guy) plus some rather enchanting ones (the lascivious guy with the wart plusthe sultry english leader of the human forces).Now for the script: it's sort of different to have a protagonist caught between two sides, neither of which is fully in the wrong but this grey-lighter grey-white morality gets pretty sickly very quickly. I liked the apes and the Kodamas, they were all cool. But the message about the poisonous quality of hate was naive.The protagonist is a one dimensional mouth piece for the writer. He experiences no character development and barely expresses any emotion. He just stoically accepts that he's been banished and does so. He gets a little passionate when he gives grand sanctimonious lectures but they have little nuance beyond ""war is bad, environment is good"". I can totally get behind this on principle but it gives me nothing on how to put this into practice.The title character doesn't really do much. You know that kid in school that chastized you for eating meat? She's that. They try to sort of make them romantic interests but...I don't care about either of them.It ends more satisfyingly that its writers movies usually do. I got real sense of high stakes and conflict that wasn't resolved by easy answers.Frozen is a movie for all ages. This was a kids' movie.See it, but but expect a movie by a master animator, not a master storyteller.","

It's pretty easy to imagine that a Miyazaki film would be my favorite for anime. What's really great is how gorgeously beautiful the animation is. Even when you get used to Miyazaki's artwork, you just still never stop being amazed at how beautiful it is. I remember reading a review of ""Pokémon 4Ever"" saying that it's obvious that director saw this movie. Yeah, it's very easy to see that as a ripoff to this movie. I mean, we feature a forest spirit and a lake that heals people and a character being absorbed into a monster.Wow, did they really think they could make something good out of a Miyazaki ripoff? Anyway, this actual movie is amazing. I heard that Miyazaki was good at romance, but honestly, I don't see that much romance in this or his other works. Still, it's a wonderful movie. One of the best parts is near the end, because of how realistic it is. It features the title Princess saying that she still doesn't trust humans but the main character is welcome to visit her in the forest while he goes back to the human world.The destroyed city is going to be rebuilt and I guess it's implied they're going to be better off this time. The spirit of the forest actually ends up dying. There's these great and truly frightening scenes where the giant boar is covered in these blood worm things. It's so powerful and horrifying. We get great battle scenes throughout the entire movie of course. It's cliché to teach about the environment, but this movie does it fine. Everything isn't perfect in the end, but at least we've learned something. ****","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","ThomasDrufke","16 September 2016","A visceral story from the brilliant mind of Hayao Miyazaki, Princess Mononoke is a joyous ride through the eyes of Ashitaka, a brave warrior who finds himself caught in the crossfire of relentless humans and vicious creatures of the forest.Speaking of relentless, even at over 2 hours long, this film flies by with brisk pacing and gorgeous animation by Studio Ghibli. For an animation film, the runtime is unusually long, but the epic scope and beautiful storytelling transcend typical animations. One of my first thoughts while watching was how good this story could be in live- action form. Even if it's a television series, the lore calls for this to be adapted into live-action.The mythology is incredibly well-realized and thought out as well. Each of the several sides to this ongoing battle against the forest have reason for fighting. Yes, Ashitaka is the protagonist, but I wasn't necessarily rooting for any particular side to win. That's when you know the characters have plenty of depth. My only real complaint here is that sometimes the dialogue comes out a bit dull and lacks the gravitas that the very scene calls for. Of course, this may only be in the English dubbed version that I watched, or the script. Either way, the story is brilliant, but the dialogue just didn't match it.Above everything else, Princess Mononoke is a special film. It transcends the usual tropes of animated films by being a viscerally graphic war film with plenty of heart and thought provoking ideas. It's no surprise this is praised as one of Miyazaki's very best films.+So different than any animated film+Meaningful violence+Interesting mythology+All characters have depth87/100","

They all have a certain sensitive demeanor and tone, a very carefully realized world in each one. As it is, it's always a pleasure to get lost within those worlds no matter the circumstances. Here, I saw this one in an English dubbing but it was pretty great. The voices really lend something to the proceedings that is not that easy to really get at by reading subtitles, even though that is always the preferred method.

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Boris-57","18 September 2004","... despite much has been made of Neil Gaiman's dubbed lines, you should absolutely watch it in Japanese with subtitles. The dubbing actors seem not to completely understand the intonations their characters' lines require, which, to me, made the first 20 minutes rather confusing. It was only when I switched to Japanese that it all seemed to make sense. Don't ask me why, like I said I guess it's intonation. Furthermore, it's always daft not to see a movie in its original language. And that goes for anime too, unless you still believe it's not real film.But this is! OK, we've seen the story about nature vs humans before (after all, is that not what the Arthur / Merlin / Morgana / Mob legends are all about?), but what makes this one stand apart is 2 things: 1. no one is all good or all evil; 2. the visuals are stunning and testify of an imagination unbound by logic. These 2 points are crucial, for it is there that most Disney films or plain Hollywood films go wrong - one could say that they're made by 5 year olds. But no, it's just the reverse! Most Disney animation and Hollywood stuff is made by 'soundly reasoning' adults with an emotional life not reaching beyond love and hate, motivational insight not going beyond revenge (or getting laid) and an imagination enslaved to logic. This film isn't, and as a consequence some call it 'difficult'. And not suitable for children. Let me tell you, 5 year olds have, with their boundless imagination, no difficulty getting into this.This film is just so good it's hard to believe someone just sat down at a table, wrote the thing and then drew it on a piece of paper.** Addition ** I've recently read the Nausicaa anime, and it becomes even clearer now that Mononoke is Miyazaki's re-take on his Nausicaa film (which was premature even in its full-length format), with Nausicaa split in two over Ashitaka & San. However, though this is obviously Miyazaki's second best (after Laputa), it remains difficult to pour all the complex musings about man's relationship to nature in 2 hours (the Nausicaa manga is over a 1000 pages long and took him 13 years; when it was finished he made Mononoke). Hence, some things (like Ashitaka helping out Eboshi even after she's done such evil deeds) have left some viewers bewildered. In all, I found the persona of Nausicaa (in the manga) more fit, in her responsible role as a princess, to convey The Message than the split version here. Still, the very idea about man & technology vs. nature and the question of ""is anything ever over"" (ewige wiederkehr, the cycle of life) is at its most nuanced here. In any case, image-wise, I doubt you'll ever see anything as beautiful as this.","

There he encounters a feral young woman, the adopted daughter of a wolf-God, who is fighting to preserve the forest from encroaching human civilisation. Directed by Hayao Miyazaki, the film is a stunning example of anime, with a rich palette and striking, memorable imagery (I especially liked the 'kodama', the odd, endearing little forest spirits). Although a clear message is sent about valuing the Earth and recognising the dangers of exploitation, the story is complex and ambiguous (especially compared to the simplistic morality plays usually pawned off as 'educational'). The look is typical of Ghibli anime (except Lady Eboshi, who looks a bit out of place) and, although the voices in the English version I watched were a bit bland, I found the characters engaging and interesting (although always secondary to the imagery). The music was also compelling and well matched to the mood and action. All in all, an excellent philosophical fantasy-adventure from the incomparable talents at Studio Ghibli.","

The masterpiece that everyone likes! and his praised by critics and reviewers around the World to be ghibli's best film. Why?.. Maybe I was never drawn to the cover art.. I thought It looked like a bad version of Zelda. So all these years have passed And I have watched all his Movies countless times over. So finally My mind was set. I started watching Princess Mononoke. The Masterpiece of all masterpieces praised to the skies! ..Boy Was I in for a big surprise! It totally sucked!! My Eyes wasn't moved to tears, I started yawning to the action scenes several times.. I was wondering..Is this Studio Ghibli? I didn't like the soundtrack, The romance never took off, For one, they didn't know each other nearly long enough to fall in love. the movie just kinda made it up and expected you to believe it. There was zero evidence of actual romance Eboushi just magically changes her mind at the end? The ending was so anti-climactic. So this girl that he is ""in love with"" decides he isn't important enough for her to invite him to live with her in the Forrest. He also doesn't care enough about the girl that ""he loves"" to follow her in the end. He'd rather go help the townspeople he met last week?!? LOL OK. After all they went though they just decide to part ways & visit each other sometimes, WTF is up with the ending??? The ending... what was the Point of cutting the head of the deer god?? so the emperor girl could awake and understand she did wrong?? she had to kill thousands of boars, shopping every tree, kill Everything just to come to that conclusion that it was pointless? The worst part of this Movie is that I absolutely adored Mononoke. But they never took advantage of that, she is Always out of camera somehow you never get to know her, except she hates humans. It feels like they made this Movie for American audience. Is that why it has such high scores? cause of the generic plot, action, blood and all that usual Hollywood crap? sorry buts that the truth. I can't find Another reason why the big fans of Ghibli actually love this one. It's Not that great. It's the worst ghibli Movie i ever seen actually.

Severed heads, severed limbs, and a surprising amount of blood amd gore are featured in the film. No problem with this really, but it can be shocking coming off films like, ""My Neighbor Totoro.""Miyazaki counters this pessimism with his usual happy ending though, and it makes great use of his two major themes.

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","guisreis","10 June 2021","This epic film has the signature of the Studio Ghibli: beautifully animated, carefully working in each minor detail, with well developped characters and immersing spectator in that bright world. It is impressive how each Ghibli film has a deep and encompassing universe from its own. This one, different from others of their films, takes place in a fantastic Japan, not in a place ressembling Europe. In my opinion, this is not among the best Ghibli films (their average level is extremely high), as it is perhaps too long and sometimes seems unfocused, but it is still a quite good movie. What is its greatest merit, brilliant and unique, is its approach about the core issue: there is a metaphoric war between the modern/progress/industry/development and nature. Off course a balance between both is desirable but it is always hard to be measured and achieved. Exploiting nature is recurrently seen as evil, because of all evironmental problems we face. Indeed, greed and irresponsability are common traits of humans and they drove us to this situation. On the other hand, progress is not compatible not to change environment, and reactionary views on that usually do not care about poverty and inequality among people and countries. Nature is not only what gives us our resources, but is also brutal, dangerous, and challenges our survival when we are exposed. All that complexity appears in the movie in the shape of two opposite sides: humans want to destroy the forest motivated by greed but also by keeping their beloved community safe; the savage forces of nature led by Princess Mononoke and some entities want to preserve it untouched and to kill invading civilization. There is no manichaeism. Both sides commit mistakes, have good reasons, do not see the other side as an interlocutor, and may be ruthless. Indeed this is the most violent film by Studio Ghibli I have watched. To resume, this animated film establishes a wonderful ""mithology"" about the layered clash between progress and nature, in which the most they fight, the most both lose.","

What makes this version unique is the amount of nuance in which it tells its story. Avoiding many of the mistakes others have fallen into by refusing to make its conflict easy and offering mature points of view.Youji Matsuda's Ashitaka is the ideal way into this world and war. He's headstrong and morally centred in a way that never wavers. Yuriko Ishida's San is equally headstrong with a mission she's determined to finish. The blossoming romance between them is allowed to take its time without having to commit to a true relationship by the end, which makes it even stronger.Hayao Miyazaki's direction inverts a lot of the usual ideas whilst still delivering pure imagination. There's definitely plenty of that trademark awe inspiring wonder but with a darker story there's also some disturbing imagery as gods morph into demons. Joe Hisaishi's score perfectly encapsulates the beauty and brutality of this world.","

A film that children can watch no doubt, but which still deals with the themes of loss, sacrifice, the non-existent line between good and evil, war, death and the dying state of divinity and spirituality. It's a heavy movie, yet it's never so excessively dark and brutal that you couldn't show it to a twelve-year- old.For me, this is one of those perfect movies that you have the honour of coming across every once in a while. Because it's really hard to find any faults in this movie.The animation? Superb, mind-blowing, unbelievably beautiful from the very first shot of mountains covered in mist to the last shot of the great forest reaching for the heavens.The music? Haunting, soul-altering, beautiful beyond believe. The main theme has had a spot on my daily playlist ever since I saw this film.The characters? Magnificent. Detailed, fluidly animated, easily having more depth than most live-action characters ever created. I also love how this movie has no clear bad guys. The clash between the spirits of the forest and the civilization of man is the central focus of the film, but you very quickly realize that neither of those sides is in the wrong. They both have reasons for their actions, for defending what they see as theirs. The methods of both are at the same time commendable and questionable. Name one other movie where you've seen anything similar. I bet you have to think about it for a while.If you had to point fingers and say that those are the bad guys, you probably would go with the bounty hunters. But even they're rather likable as characters and are only doing what they're doing because it's their job. So yeah, not even them.And sure, the movie has flaws. No film has not. The eponymous Mononoke is not all that central to the conflict and is easily the most boring of the main characters. The deer god does look silly. Don't act like he doesn't. Other things like that. But they're all really minor. Nitpicks, if even that. Because the film is just that good.Princess Mononoke renews my hope for life every time I see it. It hasn't lost even a hint of its beauty, splendor and impact over the years. If you're ever going to see only one Japanese animation, see this one. Or Spirited Away.","

Please understand that I am as surprised as you are when I say that I really didn't like this movie.Now, I don't hate Mononoke. I enjoyed the spectacle, and I recognize that it is very well-made. The story is competently told and the setting is interesting.My problem is with the characters. No one in Mononoke acts like a human being. The prince is a perfect angel who isn't affected by human emotions like fear and greed. He is utterly flawless and boring. I mean sure, he's been cursed, but it doesn't really seem to do much to him. In fact, it only appears to make him stronger. What's he complaining about?The women of Irontown are the most hateful people I could possibly imagine. After the attack, one of them joked, ""If you hadn't been there, we'd all have to find ourselves new husbands."" That's really funny, except to all of the women whose husbands are actually DEAD. What sort of callous, spiteful monster would say something like that? And worse, who would laugh at such an inappropriate joke? That same lady's husband was pushed off a cliff, almost died, and struggled for days to return home to his wife. When he finally makes it back home, what does she do? He calls him a dumbass and berates him in front of everyone. ""I wish the wolves had eaten you! Then maybe I could've found a real husband."" What a heartless bitch! There is no sense of love or camaraderie from anyone. I don't believe that these two have ever actually loved each other.I could understand this if the animals were portrayed sympathetically. They are not. All of the animals are rather dickish about eating and destroying everything in their path. The people of Irontown are only trying to defend themselves and they are made out to be the villains. Sure, they're destroying the forest, but it doesn't appear like the rest of the world is all that bad; just this place.In fact, the only person in the movie who I actually liked was Lady Obashi, the evil gun-toting power-hungry psychopath. Sure, she wanted to rule the world, but she felt like a human being. She was kind to the lepers, took pity on the whores and gave them all new and rewarding jobs. She loved her people and wanted to protect them. But she's supposed to be the villain? I don't buy it.And what about the pig? I understand that the first pig turned into a demon because he was filled with rage, but what about the old pig? The last thing he felt was hope that all of his warriors were still alive. Why did he become a demon when he wasn't full of hate? For that matter, all of the other animals WERE full of hate. All of the wolves, the monkeys, and most of the pigs were hateful, vengeful bastards. Why didn't they turn into demons? It doesn't make any sense.Perhaps the depth of this movie has been lost on me. Perhaps Miyazaki is trying to say that war can make a monster out of anyone, no matter how noble his cause. I suppose that would make for an interesting film, but I don't feel like that's what Miyazaki was trying to say. As it currently stands, I think that this is Miyazaki's weakest film.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","pc95","30 March 2009","Although not among my favorite Miyazaki films, Princess Mononoke must be given high praise for what is the standard for classical animation - Miyazaki. It's story is intriguing, but perhaps the most violent of any Miyazaki film - maybe too much. Despite that, it conjures up an interesting more historically leaning movie pitting man against nature. My favorite ideas in the movie were the kodama or forest sprites living in abundance to mark the health of the natural growth of plants, flowers, and animals as well as the kami-shika (deer god). Both were fantastically creative. The characters in the movie were fairly well done and the lack of romance was appealing. Perhaps more than other Miyazaki movies the hues of green in this movie jump out of the screen in colors as striking as any Miyazaki film. What I found a bit lacking (only in comparison) was some of the wonder and fantasy in other Miyazaki films which carry them to truly magical heights. Nonetheless, Mononoke-hime is a violent cautionary tale maybe meant to be so to jolt his usual audiences.","

In addition to the longest run-time compared to the previous Ghibli movies, the animation was also much more impressive and breathtaking. I was hooked from the opening, which showed an intense chase and fight scene. The story was intricate and made me want to see how it would all unveil. Unexpectedly, there were a lot of gore, which made the action even more thrilling. The theme about man versus nature and how nature can strike back were adamantly clear and impactful not only in 1997, but also now. For me, this is the best movie from Miyazaki so far and it was a phenomenal experience. 9.5/10","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","etg1701","9 April 2007","There have been many times where after watching an anime, I have found myself seriously questioning the value of the medium. Whether due to misogynism, gratuitous violence, or tentacles, I walk away wondering what is going on in Japanese culture. Princess Mononoke, like Miyazaki's other works, is not a vehicle for shameless fan-service, nor does it rely on the tired and implausible concept of mecha as its selling point, unlike so much anime I have seen. Instead, it deals with the age-old tension between human attempts to shape the environment for its own ends and the life-and-death power of nature.Despite its clear point, Princess Mononoke does not stray into obvious lines of good and evil or try to drop the message on the viewer like an anvil. Rather, it portrays both sides of the conflict in a balanced manner, showing the good and the bad and depicting the harm brought by hate on both sides. Perhaps the only major flaw I can see is that Miyazaki's romanticized monarchism, which leads him to again bring out the decidedly clichéd heroic warrior-prince/princess.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Blue-Grotto","25 June 2017","Something is wrong. A shapeless rage and powerful demon appears on the outskirts of a small village. Animals as well as humans are poisoned and cursed at its touch. Ashitaka, a perceptive and valiant young man and peacemaker who is wise beyond his years, recognizes that this demon is blinded by its own agony. He attempts to quiet its rage and direct the sinister power away from the village. Despite his efforts and care to avoid the demon, and his success at saving the village, Ashitaka is touched by the curse. The village oracle encourages him to journey with unclouded eyes and open mind to the source of the demon's rage - a distant forest - where Ashitaka may be able to find a way to lift the curse. The journey takes Ashitaka to an ironworks encroaching on the forest, where people, animals and demons are at war with each other, and with themselves. As Ashitaka looks for a way to lift the curse and keep from harm, he uncovers secrets of the place and characters. This includes a mysterious and beautiful young princess allied with the wolves; Mononoke.Twenty years ago, in Georgetown, a Japanese embassy sponsored advertisement of the film caught my eye. I encouraged my fiancé to come. It was our first Miyazaki film and I was stunned by its insight, wisdom, artistry and beauty. It touched on some of my basic beliefs about human nature, love and the environment. A recent trip to Japan and the remote island of Yakushima (used as a model for scenes in the film) deepened my appreciation for Princess Mononoke.The artistic beauty is timeless and dazzling to the senses. Mist rises from the mountains and ancient forests of gigantic cedars. Rainstorms, shadows, clouds and rivers appear to rush over you as they pass on screen. The landscape character is revealed in the variable light of the sun and moon. The incredible attention to detail is evident in eyes that sparkle in the night, light and ripples on water, wind on grass, haunting bird songs, different shades of stone, the flash of gunpowder and a night sky filled with stars.There is incredible complexity to the characters; female and male, animal and human, earth and supernatural. This complexity is heightened by immersion in the Japanese culture wherein spirits and demons take human or animal form, or something in between - or even beyond - both. Twenty years ago, I ruminated about my fiancé and wondered what characteristics she shared with the fascinatingly intricate, attractive, stylish and spirited female characters. Mononoke and Lady Eboshi, both willful, fearless and independent, deftly navigate the male oriented world. The two are separated by belief. Eboshi is realistic. ""We have more to fear from ourselves than from demons or monsters,"" she wisely maintains. Mononoke is idealistic about the forest and, of course, wolves. Ashitaka, the peacemaker, is respectful and observant of others. He has the admirable ability to see through the eyes of strangers and understand how they feel. Tough and vulnerable at the same time, he helps others and shrugs off aggression.There are so many bits of wisdom scattered throughout the film and in surprising places. One important and recurring theme is the precarious balance of the natural world and our relationships to others. We are connected to the environment and others in all we do, and this film underscores this point. Destruction and violence just create more hatred. The film pushes us to be non-judgmental and hopeful like Ashitaka. New life is always on the threshold and within reach, if we allow it. We may not know what form it takes, but we must leave space for it to grow. We are alive, and we have each other. The film dialogue is delightfully intricate and unpredictable. The competing interests, changing circumstances and shifting balances of life are skillfully portrayed. We cannot change fate, but we can rise to meet it.The story is based in a time when Japan, 150 years ago, was suddenly transforming from the ancient ways, to iron, gunpowder and other technologies and beliefs. Listening to the film in Japanese, with English subtitles, adds another wonderful dimension to the film. One of my favorite films ever.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","planktonrules","11 June 2007","Every movie viewer has different tastes and sometimes a film appeals to one person and not another, or vice-versa. I know that this film set attendance records in Japan and is adored by many and I will admit that TECHNICALLY it is a super well-made film--with nice animation throughout--and in many ways better than the average Disney film. However, despite all this, I just felt very little connection to PRINCESS MONONOKE as the story didn't interest me very much and lacked the charm of other Miyazaki films. Apart from the cute little forest spirits, it was obviously a very adult film and was 180 degrees different from MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, my personal favorite Miyazaki film. So, if you like the cute style Miyazaki films like me, you'll probably not appreciate this film as much as others who want a film with an agenda that focuses on nature and conservation. As for me, I don't want a message film--I want one that is just plain fun.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","EdwardtheBlackPrince","31 March 2021","Princess Mononoke was directed by Hayao Miyazaki and is the 11th film. It tells the story of a prince named ashitaka who after a cursed boar spirit attacks his village is cursed. Traveling east to find the source of the boar hatred. Ashitaka comes upon a town of outcasts and leapers lead by a woman name Eboshi. We learn that the humans of this village are at war with the spirits of the forests, humans are digging up iron ore and Desecrating the forest. As a result, it's weakening the spirits Resulting in many being turned into demons. Amongst these spirits is a human girl name San known throughout the forest as princess Mononoke raised by wolf spirits she aids them against the humans. The most notable aspect of this film is the amount of blood and gore as well the action. This is hands-down the studio's most graphic film with dismemberment, bloody wounds, and piles of corpses. It's rather serious essentially a war movie between men and nature. The overall tone of this movie is that there's not a de facto villain. It would be easy to pin Lady Eboshi as the villain that not entirely true. She's destroying the forest, she has a motive driven out by the Emperor. Caring for the lives of her people. She sees the forest as a new potential for them, willing to sacrifice to prosper. She's more interested in the money not knowing the consequences of her actions. Ashitaka is the Voice of reason stoic and Courageous he's trying to prevent conflict between the spirits and the humans so it doesn't lead to more suffering for others. You believe he's not afraid to die but he still fights to protect everything. Course the last major character is princess Mononoke how design is creative, her stories similar to Mowgli from the jungle book being raised by wolves. Similar to Nausicaa of the valley of the wind she's a warrior and she knows how to fight. Moving swift in the fight offers adrenaline. One of the small downsides is that you don't get much time to know her. The choice in scenery is an excellent choice before the tale of Princess Kaguya this was the only film set in ancient Japan so I always gave it a distinct personality. Playing off of the concept of nature and spirits the Settings are beautiful tons of landscapes panned over there show off the scale and effort put into this world. Huge amount of detail are put into the forest and the water. The design of the forest spirit & Kodama is creative. Princess Mononoke is action-packed and remains one of the best works in animation.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","griffolyon12","28 July 2009","Princess Mononoke is a rare film, one that manages to transcend its animated exterior and become simply an amazing film.Princess Mononoke is an epic fantasy, following the battle between the ancient forest spirits in feudal Japan and the persistent humans that are pillaging their forests. It is a beautiful tale about love, humanity, and the environment.Director Hayao Miyazaki is simply a master at his craft. Not only is the film highly imaginative, well drawn, and has a very tight story; it is also a highly emotional film that will not only make you feel, but also make you think. Miyazaki weaves his environmental message into the story, taking center stage amongst all the epic conflict, making you grow to appreciate the great outdoors even more after viewing this film. Not only that, Miyazaki shows us how awful war truly is, he makes us realize all the sacrifice and loss involved. He does not glorify the battles within this film, he shows them in a very real, almost upsetting fashion (or as real as war can be represented in a fantasy). Though Princess Mononoke is also a story of real love. The romance between the warrior Ashitaka and the wolf princess San is beautiful, and very real in how it unfolds. In the midst of all this conflict, these two opposites come together and form a force that is stronger than all.Even still Princess Mononoke is also a terrific action film. The action set pieces in this film are many, all being extremely inventive and exciting to watch. The opening battle with the possessed boar and San's attack on Iron Town are among two of the finer action sequences in the film. Of course the one that is truly the stand out battle scene is the battle between the humans and the boars. This battle is played out in a very affecting, very artistic way, and is definitely one of the more memorable sequences of the film.This film is easily one of Miyazaki's greatest. It is far more mature than any of his other films, and that might be why it's so special to me. It's a film that is different, but relishes in it, delivering a film that is not just a good animated film, but simply a terrific film in general.I give Princess Mononoke a perfect 10 out of 10!","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","TensersFloatingDisk","4 March 2006","Given all the hype surrounding Princess M., I expected to like this film a good deal more than I did.I tried to like it. Truly. Unfortunately, the producers make it extremely difficult to do so, since their primary conceit seems to have been: ""let's confuse our audience as much as we can."" The primary way they accomplish this is by having every character vacillate back and forth from protagonist to antagonist every other scene. The wolves are good guys. No, wait, they're threatening to kill the hero. Oh wait, they're trying to save the forest. Nope, they're just small-minded bigots. etc. etc.Worse than the mythic figures were the humans: ah, the people of IronTown are attacked by wolves, goodie! Oh wait, they're destroying the environment, I hate those guys! But wait, they're not as bad as these soldiers, so we sympathize again, only now they're shooting at the Princess of the forest, darn they're bad, but wait...And so on and so on. I recognize the desire to present complex characterizations and avoid the black-and-white mentality of so much fantasy work, but this quickly devolved into simple inconsistency. Eventually I just gave up and decided to hate everybody in the film, after which it became kind of bitter fun to watch them spill one another's blood across the screen (which they do in simply astonishing volumes).As for the environmental sub-text of the movie, it was not only severely undercut by all the heavy-handed side-switching mentioned above, but almost entirely buried in the morass of annoying mythological background which plagued the movie. In the last fifteen minutes, it turns out that this mythological stuff has actually been the whole crux of the movie (surprise), providing the excuse for a boatload of visual effects but leaving the central plot, as it has been heretofore presented, in the dust.Final words: confusing, inconsistent, turgid mythology punctuated by inadequately explained violence. Go read Harry Potter instead.","

However, the intrigue dissipates quite quickly as the movie degenerates into a long, rambling adventure with no real themes emerging.

Also, the dubbing of the American voices doesn't help at all. The only one who works is Billy Cudup who voices the young hero--his voice fits perfectly. Billy Bob Thornton is horrible--his Texas accent sounds a little out of place in ancient Japan! (Also his character makes no sense and disappears completely in the middle of the movie). Claire Danes makes the princess sound like a spoiled brat and Minnie Driver's English accent sound uproarious on an evil(?) Japanese queen.

The film is simply flawless in it's storytelling, it's animation, it's characters, and it's emotion. The film is about a boy who is cursed with a sickness that will kill him but, at the same time, gives him superhuman abilities. He ventures out of his hometown to find a cure. In the process of finding a cure, he is caught in the middle of a war between animals and humans and gets involved by the leader of the animals, a human female named Princess Mononoke. The film is an epic work of fantasy. Out of all the Fantasy films I've seen in my time, this is probably my favorite. There is so much imagination at work here with the characters and the action. At times things become overwhelming due to the epic scale and the emotion evoked in the storyline and the action. Some of the images in this film are so strange and indescribable that I can easily recommend it on the note that there are sights that you will never see anywhere else, but I don't want to make it sound like a freak show. What makes the film's bizarre images even greater is how the strength of the animation alone can carry it along with the plot in such a elegant and masterful way. It's wondrous when a person can create such images full of beauty and bizarre otherworldliness. I always love when filmmakers do that. The fact that this is animated allows these images to absorb the viewer in much simpler and extraordinary ways. At times the film is so astonishing in how it's able to carry this stuff that it is emotional.

The story takes place from the 14th to the 16th centuries. Ashitaka's tribe, the Aji, is located in the northeast of Japan. One day a wicked god from the West was going to invade the village where Ashitaka was. This wicked god was transformed from a cursed wild boar god.Seeing the evil god stepping forward, Ashitaka came forward. Although he later killed the wild boar god, he was also cursed by the evil god, and his life could not be guaranteed. In order to resolve the mystery of the curse and save himself, Ashitaka followed the instructions of the witch in his village and went to the west to find out and seek a way out.
On the way, he inquired that the guardian god of the forest, the mountain beast god, could resolve this curse, and he set off to the forest. On the way, he rescued two people who transported iron ore to the valley and met Shan for the first time. These two people were from the iron smelting plant in Abercy.In the iron workshop, he unveiled the cursed fan of the wild boar god: Abbey attacked the forest with a musket, and the wild boar god guarding the forest, the god of Nago, became a demon because of hatred after hitting her musket. That night, Shan came to attack the iron factory. She was actually the daughter of a human being raised by the white wolf god who was abandoned by humans.
Shan was in a critical situation with a few enemies, but Ashidaka was determined to save her, and he was shot for this. His life was in danger. The rescued Shan was touched by Ashidakar's sincerity and bravery. Asidakar was seriously injured, and Shan decided to take him to the forest to let the mountain beast god rescue him.
The mountain beast god rescued Ashitaka, at this time the wild boar swarms that were deeply harassed by humans decided to fight with humans to save their home forest. Shan, who loved the forest, wanted to protect the guardian of the forest and left Ashitaka. , Involved in the battle of the wild boar group and the joint army of Alberti and the samurai.In the battle between Alberti and the wild boar herd, the wild boar herd was almost wiped out. In order to find the mountain beast god, the army and the samurai army put on the wild boar skin and painted the wild boar blood to track the retreating wild boar god and Shan.
As the mountain beast god's island approached, the army surrounded the wild boar gods and Shan and attacked them. The angry wild boar god will soon become a demon, and the shan to save it will also be implicated. Ashitaka, who has just arrived, wants to save shan, but he can't help it.Seeing that the situation is irreversible, the mountain beast god overwhelmed the life of the wild boar god and thus prevented the wild boar god from becoming an evil god. At the same time, Ashitaka rescued Shan with the help of the white wolf god.
Albert West took the opportunity to shoot down the Mountain Beast God, and the White Wolf God saw it, struggling to bite off one arm of Albert West, and then died. The angry mountain beast god absorbs life to get his head back. In order to save the forest, Ashitaka and Shan finally recovered the head of the mountain beast god.The mountain beast Shenyang, who had recovered from his head and lost his head, crashed to the ground and died. With his own death, he gave new vitality to the earth in an instant.
After saving the forest, Shan still couldn't relieve her crime of destroying the forest. She chose to return to the forest. Ashitaka respected Shan's choice. The two smiled in a lush green mountain.","

We should be kind to nature, because human beings want to ""live"", maybe this is our only way out.The characters depicted in Princess Mononoke are also very delicate and profound. They are not simply good and evil. From the standpoint of human beings, She is a great leader and a humanitarian lover. From the perspective of nature, Shan Shan is a firm protector of nature and a simple girl who dares to love and hate.Nature is the god we should be awed by. In front of it, there is no right side.

I mean it's not scary or disgusting it has a gripping effect.The story of love and hate, war and peace, nature and darkness...I saw Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle before and I gotta say this is more realistic than both of them.It is true that tribes of intelligent boars,Kodamas(spirits) in the Deer God's forest, apes, and wolves, along with San (the mononoke princess of the title) who was raised by the wolves looks so mythical but one can evaluate the movie as an environment flick rendered in Japanase mythology.It can be viewed by anyone no matter how old one is!","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","dallasryan","5 April 2013","It's always a common theme from Studio Ghibli in being that we must respect and be kind to nature, just to love everything that surrounds us from animals to a single strand of grass. That man is bad, but some men within man are good. Always very intuitive movies with brilliant writing and animation from Studio Ghibli. But Princess Mononoke is one of the best in the thought provoking department. Princess Mononoke is never too redundant, it's a perfect balance on all points that it's getting across and at the same time entertaining us to the fullest enjoyment. A real special gem of a movie that will bring the viewer into a touching awareness and a smile after viewing it. A movie for all age groups. Subjectively, I'm still a bigger fan of Spirited Away, but objectively, Princess Mononoke is the best of the bunch.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","williampsamuel","10 January 2015","Princess Mononoke is by far the best anime I have ever seen. I've seen Spirited Away, Howell's Moving Castle, Ghost in the Shell, and many others, but none equal the beauty, depth, and epic storytelling of this film. Mononoke features as many fully developed characters as the largest Hollywood ensemble production, slicker fight scenes than many martial arts flicks, larger battle scenes than most war movies, and visuals as awe-inspiring as any ever drawn. The New York Post was right on the money in calling it ""The Star Wars of animated features."" I apologize ahead of time, but there is no way I can fully convey what makes this movie great without including spoilers. Consider yourself warned.The first thing that strikes you as you watch this movie is that dozens of Japan's best animators must have spent months on ending animating this film. The line art, pencils, and coloring are flawlessly executed and richly detailed in every scene. The movements and expressions of both people and animals are perfectly lifelike, individual leaves can be seen blowing in the breeze, and at times hundreds of characters occupy the screen, accompanied by smoke and flashes of gunfire. The writhing tentacles of the boar demon must have taken dozens of hours to draw all by themselves. Even Disney would probably give in and use CGI at this point. Come to think of it, the credits did mention a small computer animation staff, but for the life of me I can't remember a single frame that looked computer generated.Then there are the people. Prince Ashitaka is one of the bravest, most skilled warriors I've seen. His proficiency with both sword and bow would do Link proud. He also possesses wisdom and empathy well beyond his years. He fights and kills when he must, but his utmost priority is to save lives. And he repeatedly risks his life to stop the fighting around him, though it brings the distrust and at times enmity of all sides.Lady Iboshi is equally fascinating. Ruthless, ambitious, utterly fearless, and possessing impeccable manners, she comes off at first glance as the perfect villain. Her position as the region's top arms manufacturer and the revelation that she was indirectly responsible for his curse do little to dispel this image. After his outburst on first meeting her, and the attempt on her life, which ended with the prince helping the wounded assailant get away, I was certain that Ashitaka would side with the wolves against Irontown. And I felt a growing dread that the filmmakers would give in to heavy handed environmentalist moralizing, a la Fern Gulley.Amazingly though, they resist this temptation, instead taking a far more nuanced approach. Yes, Lady Iboshi is ruthless. Yes, she has despoiled swaths of the surrounding forests. And yes, she is in collusion with the film's real villain, whose scheme nearly brings on the ruin of everyone. But she is also generous and loyal to those who follow her. Everything she does, good, bad, or in between is to protect her people or to honor debts owed. Despite early appearances, she's an not evil woman, but a determined leader doing what she feels that she must.But the most interesting character by far is San, the wolf princess. Raised by wolves since infancy, San believes that she is a wolf, and bears an intense hatred of humanity, to the point of becoming violent when it is pointed out that she is human. And make no mistake; San is a very violent, very tough young woman. The first time we see her, she is covered in her adoptive mother's blood, which she is sucking from a poisoned wound. This chick is hard core.With characters like these there is lots of action, and all of it is awesome. The fight scenes are fast paced and beautifully choreographed, if that's the right word to use for animation. The prince's opening clash with the boar demon is exhilarating and more than a bit frightening, and the duel between San and Iboshi is simply breathtaking in the intensity and skill displayed by both combatants. The later battle sequences are likewise stunning in their scale and violence. The charge of the boar tribe rival's the Rohirrim's charge from Return of the King in its thunderous power, and the ending is like something out of Godzilla.Any way you look at it, Princess Mononoke is a wonderful film. It's grandiose, exciting, spellbinding, filled with a rich cast of characters, and possesses a clear message about the need for balance between man and nature, and the destructive power of anger. It may be too violent for small children, and I'm sure there's a good amount of subtext that western viewers will miss, but this is a movie that has something for everyone. I would highly recommend it to all audiences.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","MrPupkin","23 October 2019","First Studio Ghibli movie to mix hand-drawn and CG-animation, resulting in a piece of art and the greatest Studio Ghibli film ever created. A masterwork with compelling characters, a fascinating story and a great message to be learned. Hayao Miyazaki's best film still manages to put many modern anime movies to shame with its amazing visuals, action packed scenes and wonderful soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi. Mononoke Hime avoids the classic black or white morality issue and deals with more powerful themes than other Ghibli movies, turning this film from something that could've easily been a children's book into a fantastic tale for people of all ages. This is, in my opinion, the best anime film of all time.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","jadentortiz","4 December 2015","Princess Mononoke is a 1997 animated film by Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. The word Mononoke is a Japanese word for specter or spirit. The film was received positively by critics and won 4 awards in Japan. A central theme of the movie is the environment and humanity's fear of the unknown. Industrialization is also a key factor as iron town wants to expand mining for iron into the forest. The forest gods do not agree with this and that is how the whole conflict starts. The story revolves around a boy Ashitaka who became cursed by a demon and must rid his curse or die. He travels to the west in search of the forest god to lift his curse. Meanwhile a group of villagers are traveling home and are attacked by the wolf clan. Ashitaka meets the wolf clan along the way and befriends them. Princess Mononoke is the adoptive daughter of the wolf god. He travels to iron town events transpire and the humans and beasts battle for the forest. Ashitaka and San (Princess Mononoke) must save the beasts and humans or suffer the destruction of both.Ashitaka has an understanding of the unknown and knows he must rid the curse he has. The people living around the forest and in iron town, are afraid of the beasts and what they don't know lurks in the forest. How they try and overcome this issue is with guns, burning down the forest, waging war with the forest animals, and killing the forest gods. They don't try and problem solve how they can fix it, they just start shooting the place up. This could be carried over into today as people don't try and solve their problems by working with others and go in head on. Wars and other problematic events occur today because of that unwillingness. Today we have people who care too much and some who don't care about the environment. The issues that Princess Mononoke discusses are still relevant today. The taking of land to expand an empire has been around for a long time. Today we have cities expanding and taking up natural land. San is an example of someone who cares about the environment and will do anything to maintain the peace of the forest and the forest gods. In order to protect the forest San goes to the iron city to kill the leader so they will stop destroying the land. She fails to kill the leader and this drives the conquest to destroy the forest to increase. Ashitaka knows that the forest is a vital part in the ecosystem. He tries to help San save the forest and stop the bloodshed. While in the iron city he takes a bullet and ""dies"" to save San. San takes him to the forest god to heal him. The forest god sees the potential within Ashitaka and brings him back to life. Ashitaka then goes to reason with both parties to save the city. A monk and the leader of the iron city follow Ashitaka back into the forest and kill the forest god. This makes a deadly goo that kills what it touches. The monk takes the head of the forest god. The god forms into a being and takes aim to reclaim his head. Ashitaka then stops the monk and gives the head back to the god. This brings balance to the world and restores the land to a healthy state. Him and San go separate ways to restore what once was. Ashitaka is the example of what people need to do today to protect what is important to them. By going on his journey he shows a motivation to protect what he cares about. He goes willingly knowing that he will not see his family again but that they will be safe. He later learns to care for the forest and does what he can to protect it. He is a strong example of if you care about something you will do anything to protect it. This is a strong character trait throughout the anime genre.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","kikiboo_8","21 January 2022","The movie had some pretty big potential. Which it didn't use. In the beginning the story seemed very compelling. The scene with the boar covered in worms chasing Ashitaka was pretty damn original. The whole idea was. I mean the poor thing was suffering so much and the curse drove him mad and killed him slowly. Ashitaka got the same curse from him and now he's supposed to find a way to lift it. He meets princess Mononoke, lady Eboshi and so on. Then the plot gets rushed, boring and uncompelling. I didn't feel any kind of connection with any of the characters, didn't empathize with them, root for them or found them interesting or relatable at all. So, I watched the whole thing more so I'd finish what I started rather than cause I actually wanted to.Point being, it really could have been much better.","

It is a good movie but I guess I had too much expectation. I'd rate it towards the bottom of Miyazaki movies. My daughter also loves Miyazaki. Her favorites are Totoro and Ponyo. And this one was fairly highly rated so we watched it together. Well, this one is neither for kids or for adults. It's like adult story told by a kid.My daughter was mortified by all the brutal beheadings and body parts flying around. My wife didn't appreciate animated women showing off their cleavages and hitting on a child. And I didn't like how literal the storytelling was. It was basically explaining everything instead of implying it for viewers to think about.The basic plot was good. I even wonder if James Cameron got the idea for Avatar from this movie. The visuals are great and I loved how much detail he put into everything. But that's about it. This movie had so much potential.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","oltmansg","2 October 2000","I suppose I am a glutton for punishment. I've had a love/hate relationship with anime for quite some time now. Despite being disappointed more often than pleasantly surprised. I keep coming  back for more for some reason. I suppose it's because I hope that sometime someone will get it right and finally mix stunning  visuals (of which there are plenty in the anime world) with a coherent plot, and an interesting story (of which there are woefully few).Princess Mononoke fits into this category quite nicely. The visuals are absolutely breathtaking. I would rate it in the same  category along with other fantastic anime like Macross Plus, Ninja Scroll, Ghost in the Shell, and Wings of Honneamise. The framerate was better than average for most anime. The only place I think they could have improved was on the behemoth night-walker spirit, which seemed a little choppy at times.The soundtrack is one of the best you'll hear. The musical score in particlar excels right through to the end of the movie. The sound effects were outstanding also. If a soundtrack CD is offered for this movie, I'll buy it in a heartbeat.Where the movie really disappoints is with the storyline. This is tragic too, because there are so many good characters on which to develop and plot devices (the tree spririts were fantastic) to use. After the first 30 minutes or so, the plot becomes incoherent, with no clear direction, and the characters sink into the not necessarily good/bad roles that has become the norm for anime.I feel that Princess Mononoke scores highly on technical merit, but really lacks when it comes to an involved, entertaining storyline. I hope that anime studios will learn from this, and in the future hire some talented writers to match their artists.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Shilo_R_A","28 October 2021","""Can nothing be done? To simply wait for death...""Princess Mononoke is the kind of film that sounds like a cool metaphor with an important message, but turns out to be much more when you dive deep into it.This movie tells the story of Ashitaka, a young warrior from a small eastern village. While defending his village from a mad demon-god, Ashitaka got cursed, and he has to travel far to the west in order to lift the curse, to save himself.But this is not what this movie is really about, and you probably know that. Princess Mononoke is about the relationship between humans and nature. It's also kinda about the climate crisis, but it's not the main thing so I'll leave it for now.Nature may bring life (""I neve knew that the deer god made the flowers bloom..."") or take them away. It may, and it does.And when we take, nature takes too. That's kind of how it works, and Miyazaki communicates this idea in a very interesting, subtler than expected way, on Princess Mononoke. The whole film is one big allegory, but the way that each character portrays a certain mindset, or the way that a single line of dialogue can add so much to this allegory is quite damn impressive.I think that the score here is solid too, the plot is - though slow a bit at times - quite interesting, and the final act is especially great. You know how much I love a strong ending.Oh, and the animation is decent too. I know that miyazaki went on to create stuff that's by far more impressive visually, but this film is still very well made, and for a relatively small budget this film looks really solid.Issues I take with this film - San's character is a little underdeveloped in my eyes. Especially her relationship with Ashitaka or Moro. Also, I feel like Miyazaki kinda shows a little bit of escapism regarding the climate change towards the end of the film, BUT. I do get that it may very possibly not be exactly what he was aiming for, and the message of the film is still quite important and is communicated in a deep way, and not through one pov only.So, that's it I guess. This film is pretty damn good, and though it has some issues it's definitely worth your time. The message is important, the allegory interesting and the film is very well made as a whole. Plus, a strong final act is alway great. I'm feeling an 8.4/10 on this one.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","lou-50","19 November 1999","""Princess Mononoke"" is pure and simply a morality tale, presented in the finest tradition of Japanese animation with such detail that it almost seems real.  This 1997 film finally made its showing here two years later with the added voiceover of well-known Hollywood stars such as Claire Dane, Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, and Gillian Anderson.  So given that pizzazz, can a film with obvious Oriental themes - the dignity of nature and the consequences of its violation by man and the enduring spirituality that makes life timeless, work on an American audience?  Yes, because ""Princess Mononoke"" skillfully orchestrates the breathtaking outdoors with its mysticism as well as coordinated battles and other action scenes to tell a story both adult and children can understand.  No, because the simplicity of presentation makes some people think it is hokey.  Additionally, love relationships, whether it is between mother and child or boy and girl, are intentionally restrained by Western standards so we feel cheated when the best romantic scene is one where the Princess chews up jerky beef before transferring it to the mouth of her Prince.  Given that, ""Princess Mononoke"" is worth the price of admission just for its well designed animation and its hair-raising suspense, even if we can't appreciate the Spirit of the Forest' and the cataclysmic forces it has on all of us.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Alcaminhante","27 July 2000","After the recent invasion of Dragon Balls and Pokemons, somehow i had in my mind the idea that this was going to be another commercial crappy manga for kids. Despite that i decided to go see it and check for myself why the movie reviewers where praising this movie so much, rating it FIVE stars out of five.Unfortunately, in my country, (Portugal), this movie is playing only once a day in the early afternoons. As usual in Portugal, animation is treated all equal. Animated movies >little kids, and so this movie plays here in the few theaters that bought it (4 ), right about after lunch in little children time slot. What is realy amazing, is that i´m sure the Portuguese distributors of PRINCESS MONONOKE even saw the movie, because if they did, they would notice, (or perhaps not), that this is not a movie for little children. First because there are some very explicit gore scenes, where arms and heads are chopped off occasionally  along the whole movie, there´s violence (and i don´t mean just action violence), reference to more adult themes, (plenty of the female characters are ex-prostitutes) and a few more details like this.I don´t have any problem in taking any kid to see a story like this, but i´m sure there are a bunch of conservative parents out there, that by this time have just forbidden their kids of watching Pokemon, thinking that somehow Mangas are all the same.But PRINCESS MONONOKE isn´t a kids movie just because of this. Above all ,it´s because of its plot and storyline wich gets to complex for little kids to follow. One thing that amused me a lot, was watching some kids in the front row, totally confused because they couldn´t figure out who were the bad guys ! Others were totally bored and only paid real atention to the movie in the action scenes complaining all the time the movie was boring and not very easy to understand.In fact, actually, this movie has probably the best screenplay currently displayed in any movie right now. I wish i could find a non-animated movie out there at this moment with a screenplay capable of touching this one in quality and complexity. Not Mission Impossible for sure. ( And then it´s the animation films who are considered ,stuff for kids ! :-) )I won´t get in the story of PRINCESS MONONOKE because part of pleasure of watching this movie, is going to see it without any clue whatsoever. I´m just going to say, it´s a very ecological movie, set in medieval china (i guess), and where spirits and anything magical, is treated like just another thing made by Mother Nature and not like some supernatural characters that we usualy find everywhere. There are no real heroes in here, and no real bad guy in sight. It´s a slow paced movie, with a brilliant animation, a very intimist plot, a little bit of crude violence (but depicted in a very ""natural"" way, not just there to show off), excelent characters, fantastic landscapes and a pretty good soundtrack that goes almost unoticed. And this movie is BIG. It´s not your regular 75/80 minutes for kids. PRINCESS MONONOKE plays for about 130 minutes.If you like Manga, (and i don´t mean Dragon Ball), real Manga like AKIRA, or WINGS OF HONEAMISE, you can´t miss this movie, because it´s actualy a brilliant movie. Definetely one of the best this year. If you are a fan ,of an old Manga movie called WARRIORS OF THE WIND, then PRINCESS MONONOKE is from the same director, and the style is more or less the same. I read this director is not going to make any more manga movies , (WHY?!!), and that this was his goodbye to animation features. :-(Well let me tell you, this is what we can call, going out in style ! Brilliant movie, (just not for every audiences).Don´t miss it.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","thousandisland","9 May 2001","I don't understand what all the commotion is about with this film.. Yes, it is beautiful to look at and has great characters and artistry, but it's so hard to follow!  It suffers the same deadfall that many, perhaps MOST anime films do.. The plot is just too confusing.  It starts out ok, even the middle of the film is engaging, but by the end of it there is utter confusion:  Too many characters fighting for too many different reasons.  I am even a science major, an adult, and an animation connoisseur, and this film stumps me.  There are all of these different parties going after the forest spirit, but also fighting eachother.  The forest spirit is ambiguous itself, friendly one moment, and then dangerous when its head is cut off. Warriors want to keep the head as a trophy, so they're stirring up trouble for everyone. There are the metal workers who are doing their own thing but inadvertently creating demons when animals get shot.  Sometimes.  Depending on the species of animal which is infected with the bullet. I think.  Then you have the boar people who are fighting everybody and trying to protect the forest.. And the princess and the wolves, who are really aloof and not on anybody's side.  And then there's Ashitaka, who is mixed up with all of them and has the demon infection himself and wants to find a cure. And we have to hurry up and reunite the forest spirit with its severed head, or we're all doomed.Get all that?  Lovely artwork from the characters to the landscape to the action... Breathtaking scenery and mysticism, but a little too muddled to come off triumphant.  This film would be excellent if it were more explanatory, or just had its plot streamlined a bit.  Anime fans may get it, but I think the average American viewer will be up the creek without a paddle.  Or maybe on the shore WITH a paddle.  Anyway, I'm getting dizzy just trying to sort it out.  A for effort, though..","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","perni","23 August 2002","I have always been interested in the field of animation, but one major chunk of the industry has alluded me for quite some time. That would be anime, a genre of animation that continues to be insanely popular in the East but widely regarded as geek-fare over here in the States. My interest rose upon hearing about Hayao Miyazaki and his wonderful films that have broken box office records in Japan. The first film I saw that was directed by him was Kiki's Delivery Service, a charming movie with a leisurely pace and appealing characters. Princess Mononoke is a very different beast, however, and is not a kid friendly fable by any means. It's a very complicated war epic that combines mythology and politics to make one amazing adult film. Sure, there is some great comic relief, but there are also decapitated soldiers, demon boars who puke buckets of blood, and characters who get shot point blank. In short, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU SHOW TO THE KIDS YOU'RE BABYSITTING WHILE YOU GO AND PIG OUT ON PIZZA HOT POCKETS. The only people I see watching Princess Mononoke are mature fans of animation who can handle some gore and a deep, convoluted plot. Your basic summary of the movie's story might go something like this: A prince kills a rampaging demon that tries to attack his village, and in the process receives a deadly cures that will slowly poison his mind and body. He must now journey deep into the forest and try to find a cure, but along the way he meets a large cast of characters who are at war with one another. There's the samurai, who want the ore of Iron Town, a soft spoken warrior who guards that town, and the creatures of the forest, who are led by Princess Mononoke. At over 2 hours long, you can trust that this is just a small piece of the complete tale. The ending is a classic moment involving destruction and rebirth, and is one that cannot be missed. My favorite character had to be the Forest Spirit, a creature with bird-like legs, elk antlers, and the face of a human. I won't say anymore. Just see it, and then check out other Miyazaki flicks like Spirited Away, My Neighbor Tortoro, and Castle in the Sky. ****/****","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","mbhgkmsgg","14 November 2020","Beautiful. Honest. Startling. Those are some of the words that I would use to begin to describe this masterpiece. Princess Mononoke is a brutally honest look at human nature and man's fight against what we don't understand.This movie depicts our relationship with nature more accurately than I would like to admit. Eiter we want to own it or control it, or we fear it because we don't understand it. This is how we have always been, now perhaps more than ever before. We don't care what happens to what is around us as long as it benefits us. And if don't understand it we want to destroy it. Princess Mononoke is, of course, a fantasized version of that brutality, but it doesn't mean that the message isn't accurate.Although this film is full of ugliness it is also exceptionally beautiful. What has never ceased to amaze me is the feel of these films. Achieved with emotional and beautiful music and gorgeous visuals, it's hard not to love every moment and every scene. No matter how difficult or dark a moment in this film is, there is always beauty in it too.It's hard to find any fault in this film. Sure, the story might drag for a bit too long in the middle but you'll forget about that in no time. It's also quite a violent film. Something that might put some people off. Personally, I thought that it was necessary for this film and it drove the message home very effectively. That's something that I have always loved about Miyazaki's films. No matter how crazy or weird his worlds are, the message always shines through brightly. What's more, the message is always important and good.I'm by no means an expert when it comes to Studio Ghibli or Hayao Miyazaki films. I have seen some them over the years and they have always stood out to me from the sea of movies. They have always stunned me with their beauty and made me reflect on the message they convey. And Princess Mononoke is no different.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","IkuharaKunihiko","4 August 2005","Medieval Japan. Ashitaka has been infected with a strange disease when he killed a mysterious demon boar covered with leaches that attacked his village. On his journey to find a cure he meets lady Eboshi, a female leader of a town exploiting the forest and fighting with creatures protecting the nature. The leader of those creatures is San, princess Mononoke...When I first went to see ""Princess Mononoke"" I expected a gentle, romantic, dreamy fairy tale. Was I surprised when I saw the raw and brutal story! This is in my opinion Miyazaki's most violent film, but non the less, it really is an impressive anime. I wouldn't necessary put it on the 102. place on the IMDb's top 250 films, but I admit it has something in it that fascinates me.------- The most clever aspects of the story are the ones about how lady Eboshi is tricking her people into helping her exploit the Forest, while at the same time dismissing the wolf's revenge attacks as something illogical. Also, just watch the sequence where San is being captured inside a sea of red leaches on a demon boar: the part where Ashitaka jumps into that bunch of leaches trying to save San from them, but is being catapulted into the water, is pure dark poetry and romance in one. Also, there's the spectacular image of the gigantic deer god's body walking through the hills.Still, Miyazaki made a lot of mistakes. The middle of the film is repetitive and too long making only the end exciting, the characters are somewhat wooden and the whole mood of the anxious world is way over the top. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone younger than 16. Also, I miss a lot of humor Miyzaki had in his previous films. I got the idea he made ""Mononoke"" just because he was in his depressive ""I hate the world"" phase. All in all, the epic ""Princess Mononoke"" deserved it's success( it's average critic's grade on rotten-tomatoes.com is 7.7/10 ), but in the long term there was still something missing in it's story. What? Just watch ""Being there"" or ""The Graduate"" and you'll see what.Grade: 6/10","

I wanted to like it - the animation was impressive and the creatures and characters were memorable - but I couldn't get caught up in the story. This film wasn't for me, though I understand why others might like it.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","datautisticgamer-74853","29 December 2017","Like with My Neighbor Totoro, this film was playing at the Music Box Theater near me as a New Year's celebration. Thus, I spent the better part of today's afternoon viewing it there. Judging by my rating, you may see where I'm going with this...I was impressed with how this film was presented in its original Japanese language, just subtitled so English speakers could comprehend. It also limits the amount that it can be censored by dubs, which I'm sure other Studio Ghibli movies went through when Fox and Disney dubbed them in the 90s. Anyway, the story is probably where my hardest judgment on this movie is. It can be hard for the common family to understand with its supposed subplots, but they are all written in a way that pristinely intertwine. Just when the second act starts to turn dull (if I had to downgrade this to a 9, it would probably be for that reason, though it doesn't go there), it hoists upon us the epic, heart-stopping third act that had me literally on the edge of my seat in awe. It's an experience I had never really gone through before with a Studio Ghibli film. The music really bolstered this movie, too, since it makes up for not being too tear-jerking with mixing to perfection with the mood and setting, plus beautiful lyrics portrayed by Yoshikazu Mera. The characters contribute to this being a really somber and edgy movie, definitely the perfect contrast to the silliness and light-heartedness of My Neighbor Totoro; they are written in such a way that their overall motives possess several complexities, which admittedly did have me slightly confused. It just goes to show how important the name Hayao Miyazaki is in animation as a whole. Giving us all this is animation that is blowout by anime standards at the time. Glorious environments and character designs come with some of the best incorporation of CGI to hand drawn I have seen in a movie so far. I probably could not make my admiration for Studio Ghibli's animation more lucid than here.You will take something out of this film when you watch it. It is the best anime film I have seen yet, and I want to ensure that more families, especially ones who are ready to expose their children to such edginess, and otaku can view this film. If there is an anime film that one must see before they perish, this is it. I cannot recommend this film enough in a review like this, so stop reading and find a way that you can view it. Once again, Studio Ghibli, I want to thank you for capitalizing on what Akira introduced to us 9 years ago; it was completely worth it.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","joshuafagan-64214","28 February 2016","This is one of the greatest movies created. If you need a film to convince you that animated movies are not just for kids, check out Grave of the Fireflies. If you need a film to convince you that animation is high art, check out this.There are four films above this on my list. But none of them strike me with the same sense of awe that this one does. You know that feeling you get when you watch something great for the first time? I get that feeling every time I watch this film.This was the first animated film to every win the top prize at Japan's equivalent of the Oscars, and that's not for a lack of there being great animated films. All film bodies seem to be biased against animation. So for a film to break through that barrier and win that grand award, it would have so be something really special. And this film is.It became the highest-grossing film in Japan ever upon release. Even after 20 years, it's still in the top six. The film in the top spot nowadays? Spirited Away.I love Spirited Away. It is one of the greatest films of all time. I will watch it twenty more times in the future, and if I ever have kids, I'll make sure to show it to them once they get old enough to appreciate it.But this film is better.Why? It has a lot to do with the kind of stories the films tell. They both tell their stories extremely well, but Spirited Away is more of a small-scale, conventional story about a girl finding her way home. Princess Mononoke is a grand epic about war, human nature, inevitability, resilience, philosophy, and culture.The best description I can come up with is that this film would Japan's version of The Iliad if The Iliad was as sprawling and beautiful as The Lord of the Rings. But that description does not really do it justice. This is a movie I can spend hours discussing and analyzing from every angle. Even if I saw it a thousand times, I don't think I'd ever get tired of it.Our lead is Prince Ashitaka, who in defending his village had his hand cursed by a demon. He must leave his people, who are rapidly dying out, and ride west to in an attempt to get his hand cured by the forest spirit. But there is a war raging between the forest and man, and he must attempt to negotiate a peace between the two sides if he hopes to get healed. He meets up with San, the titular Princess Mononoke, who was raised by wolves after being abandoned by her human parents. She has a nasty hatred for all things human, but she ends up falling in love with Ashitaka, and the two of them put their lives on the line to bring peace and stop man and beast alike from being torn to pieces.Technically, this is an environmental movie, but it's not preachy or one-sided or simplistic or even biased in favor of nature. It simply presents the two sides and lets the viewer think what they will. Even if this movie were bad, I would give it immense respect for that. Whereas lesser movies are afraid of nuance, this film is built upon it.The characters are a great example of this. There is no real 'bad guy' in this film, just forces and players and people with ambitions and people with understandable prejudices. No character is perfect, but every character is relatable, resulting in a piece of complex and nuanced art.And it is most certainly is art. If there were ever a movie that deserved to be calm, it's this one. The story is electric. The animation is gorgeous. The music is some of the best I've heard in any film. The emotions these 120 or so minutes evoke in me are so numerous and complex that I couldn't hope to list them here. This film would be worth traveling halfway around the world to see. That's not something I often say.This film manages to start out great, get better as it goes along, and finish out on a high note. The last twenty minutes are some of the greatest I've ever seen in any film. It takes all the energy and themes that have been present throughout the film and kicks them into hyperdrive. It's so overwhelming, I don't turn off the film until the credits are done rolling. That's how long it takes for me to even begin to unpack the rush that has unfolded before me.What makes it perfect is that the second credits theme, a replaying of The Legend of Ashitaka, is simply amazing. It a perfect piece of music. It's one of my five favorite pieces of all time. Whenever it randomly comes in my playlist, I get chills down my back. When it comes up in the ends credits, I collapse into a glorious fit of emotions and sensual overload and glorious euphoria.From its visuals to its storytelling to its presentation, this is the definitive animated film. It is superb. It is beautiful. It is a masterpiece.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","jackthepgl","1 September 2023","Princess Mononoke is one of the reasons why Studio Ghibli hit the mark on it's predecessor much like Spirited Away later on, this one is an absolute masterpiece and just when I am doing this review, I'm just gonna say that the director who directed before he directed Spirited Away, it is Hayao Miyazaki. He works for Studio Ghibli along with two others like Toshio Suzuki and Isao Takahata. They're the ones who are responsible for making animated films beautiful and impeccable entertaining those who are fans of anime. Now that I got that out of the way, let's continue on. An Emishi village is attacked by a hideous demon and the last of the Emishi who is a prince called Ashitaka, kills it before it reaches the village, but it manages to grasp his arm and curses him. The curse grants him superhuman strength, but it also causes a scar-like mark that will surround him, cause him pain, and eventually kill him. The villagers discover that the demon was a boar god and the wise woman tells Ashitaka that he may find a cure in the western lands where the demon came from, so he goes out on the journey to find a cure to cure his arm before he dies. Along the way he comes across a young woman named San played by Claire Danes, who was raised by the wolves and feels hatred for humans. Yeah, a woman who is raised by wolves and has hatred for humans. You can see where this is going whilst you kept watching but all I can say is, she's a human too. The only way he can get the cure from his arm is from the Great Forest Spirit who is a deer-like animal god. After the day I watched Spirited Away, I was actually going to go for the ones that are highly rated which of course being Spirited Away itself which is why it's being one of the more impeccable ones that are on that category. That being said is like I said before if you have your own account from many movie websites you will see many lists of highly rated movies you've seen and haven't seen. You cannot go wrong. Despite being a PG film, some of the scenes that can be quite brutal. Well, not to worry, at least they have their uncle's with them. Hahaha. If you're looking at the environment of the message that it contains and you're thinking the same thing like ""Did I ever hear this message before?"" Yeah, like you're thinking about man and nature. And like you're thinking the same story like thinking about this as the Japanese Pocahontas, the Japanese FernGully: The Last Rainforest, the Japanese Dances with Wolves and the Japanese Avatar. Well, I think you guys are having with your head. Next! To be very frank here, this is not the case. There is no character that is considered an antagonist. The way it tells the story is astonishingly extraordinary. Princess Mononoke is absolutely one of the more impeccable animated films and much like the ones I've seen so far when I was a kid and adult which are nostalgic and much like Spirited Away however, this is one of the more powerful films I have ever seen period and that's saying something. This'll be like Star Wars of anime even when you're looking at engaging characters, impeccably beautiful animation and an epic story. For any anime fan, animation fan and film buffs, this is an absolute must-watch. It has every right to be an epic masterpiece and so many who are looking for something powerful and something more engaging, then seriously go see this movie right away. It is everything you want in anime. As much as I love Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke is the absolute spectacle of animation heaven.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","bellino-angelo2014","28 April 2021","Before I go into discussing the movie, I have to point out that before I saw PRINCESS MONONOKE I had never seen an Hayao Miyazaki before and I wanted to begin with this one. It's among his lesser movies but it was ok for me as an introduction.The movie is set in feudal Japan. In the beginning young prince Ashitaka protects his village and kills a huge demon spider. A injury infects his arm and so he has to travel for finding a cure and a monk talks about him of the great forest spirit. In the village he finds Lady Eboshi who is cutting down the trees and kills the forest's animals. Her major objective is to cut off the head of Okkoto, the forest spirit. She is opposed by the animals and by Princess Mononoke.I have seen the movie in the English dubbed version since I hadn't studied Japanese and for dubbing the characters they picked some famous stars of the 1990s-2000s' movies (such as Jada Pinkett Smith, Billy Bob Thornton, Gillian Anderson, Keith David who also narrates the movie, Minnie Driver and Claire Danes) and it has quite great animation for its time. However at times felt a bit too long and it should have been trimmed of at least 30 minutes as at times I even felt bored. But in the end, I kinda liked it mostly for its message.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","FlorisV","2 May 2003","I have seen plenty of Anime films and have mixed feelings about all of them. This one is no exception. Most Anime suffer from vague or erratic plots. Altho this film was actually relieving in that part, it still could have had a more tight plot because it was sometimes confusing, there were so many enemies the humans in the forest were fighting against. The animals, the forest spirit, the wolf girl, the demons, the other human tribe...a little bit more focus would have been nice. The movie is over 2 hours long, which is pretty exceptional for animated films, and in this case too long.Good about this anime was the a-typical hero who kept hoping for peace. Also, typically anime, no distinction between good or bad, just opposing forces who get in each others way. It's a good tale about the destructive force of hatred, in the form of leech-like demons. The animation is top-notch. Altho I'm not the biggest fan of the particular drawing style, it is original. No huge eyes or cheap, lazy animations here!I give it a 7,5/10","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","cbentrott","3 February 2023","STORY: The movie isn't really centered around princess Mononoke, so that's kind of misleading. It's more focused on a poisoned warrior who is sent away from his hometown. The whole movie seems to be a metaphor for deforestation, industrialization and environmentalism. While the movie gets the point across, it's a bit on the nose. Along the way, there is endless creativity with characters and scenery, which is refreshing and reminds me of the true capabilities of anime. Overall it's a compelling enough story but not really surprising or eye opening.ACTING: The English dubs of the movie were honestly my biggest qualm. I feel like Minnie driver and billy bob thorntons voices did not match the vibe of the characters at all. It was distracting. I recommend watching the movie in its original language with subtitles.","

Grave of the Fireflies is a rough one, and I will immediately go and write a review on it after this one. Anyway.Mononoke Hime is a powerful movie, and I have seen it countless times. Unlike Grave, it is extremely watchable and approachable. The story isn't subtle, but neither is it simplistic. There is no 'bad guy' in this story as everyone is open and upfront with our hero, an unbiased observer, we can quickly learn that everyone has relatively decent reason for what they do.Still everyone is consumed with the fervor of war that even poisons the land itself, and we the lucky viewer get to watch a man who barely remembers the war, but did know its effects. All of his best works speak on and condemn war, and I can respect a man who is so vocal and honest about the horrors and destruction it brings.Not his best telling of the story, but definitely the easiest and most enjoyable to watch. If you don't know who the man is. Do yourself a favor and start here.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","benjamin_lappin","24 July 2006","Complex, simple, emotive, stark, bleak and truly brilliant, Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke is a work, not only of animated art, but truly a landmark in cinematic achievement. Miyazaki, first bit the conflicted notion of human nature versus Mother Earth in his 1986 work of Nausicaa of The Valley of The Wind and truly brought this issue to the fore in many a persons mind. Mononoke, is the defining glory, capsulating over ten years of thought and hard effort. It is intrinsically deep, and powerfully moving, with the notion and human sensibility of love, being the driving force, and, like in many a Miyazaki movie, is the answer to the problems. Compassion and understanding, key humanitarian traits, that we as a species often take for granted, and fail to utilise. After suffering infection and contracting a fatal disease from a dieing Shisigami, or demon, Ashitaka our films major protagonist, sets off on a journey to travel far to the west, leaving behind his native clan and position of prince to discover the source and cause of an old gods transformation into demon. Driven by determination and honesty his search brings him to Iron Town, and a sacred Forest, where he must view an on going feud with ""unclouded eyes"" and bring peace to a region, so fraught with hate and war. Paragraphic summaries, however, do not credit this film nearly enough. It is a landmark film, and while Akira alerted the world to the presence of anime, it was Mononoke that smashed through into the mainstream to enable this joyous art form to be enjoyed in the West. Princess Mononoke encapsulates the very essence of what it is that makes us human, yet Miyazaki understands there are two sides to every coin. He does not skirt over the issue, that we as a race have the ability to destroy, to act for our own selfish needs, instead he forces the issue, while concurrently highlighting that we also have potential. The ability to make things right, is buried deep within our psyche, it is intrinsic to humanity and the differential between us and animals. He shows if we cling onto our ethics and morees we shall prevail. A must for any fan cinema.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","lucianomarzo92","10 November 2015","Princess Mononoke is, by far, the best animated movie I have ever seen. From the very beginning, it captures the viewer's imagination and continues to captivate even as its length exceeds the two-hour mark. The film is well-known for its environmental message and stunning animation, but it deserves equal praise for its well-drawn characters, dynamic action sequences, and compelling narrative.Princess Mononoke tells the story of Ashitaka, a courageous warrior who, soon into the movie, battles a cursed boar god on a rampage in his homeland. Ashitaka is able to slay the beast, but just before he does, it latches onto him and afflicts him with its curse.In an effort to lift the curse, which he soon finds is deadly, Ashitaka heads west. Along the way, he discovers several mystical creatures in the forest, one of them being the beautiful San, a young girl who lives among wolves and despises humans, yet who must somehow reconcile her antagonism to mankind with her own humanity and her fondness for Ashitaka. After emerging from the woods, Ashitaka becomes acquainted with the workers at a mining colony whose weapons, he learns, have inflicted this curse upon him.Finding himself in a conflict between the workers of the mining colony, who wish to advance their civilization at the expense of the natural world, and the forest gods, who have declared all humans as the enemy, Ashitaka must choose between fighting alongside the forest gods as well as San, whom he cares deeply for, and defending his own kind.In a riveting war between man and beast, the creatures of the forest are left with no choice but to retaliate against the humans' progressively hostile and encroaching way of life. An epic battle ensues, one that, while rooted in the fantasy genre, is surprisingly relevant to the world at large. In its depiction of the disconnect between civilization and nature, the film possesses true allegorical significance as, even amid great chaos and suffering, it contains rare moments of healing and peace.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","willeasyer","20 July 2020","A true masterpiece that contrastes Miyazaki's genius. For me this film represents life with its ambivalence, like true life seen on a microscopic level there's no good or bad, no final Victim or offender since everything is a matter of perception. And princess mononoke shows this perfectly by not setting any true antagonists. Since all the sides of this film are doing what they're doing for a convincing reason, for their survival and ishitaka serves as the mediator in the middle of this storm trying to find harmony. It's also more relevant then ever because the way it addressed industrialization and its desastrous effect on earth, the human thrust for more resources will lead to his end, and our stiving to survive might be, ironically the reason of our extinction. The film is very savage, brutal and dark, it's definitely not a kids film because i don't see a kid comprehending it. Still the animation is stunning, the details, the colors the movements this movie is a work of art, and it's really a statement of how animation can provide a complexe and solid substance that live action features can't. This movie will wow you, and honestly we need it now more then ever before.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Nigel St. Buggering","2 November 2003","Not only better than anything you're likely to see from the Disney school of factory filmworks, but quite possibly THE best animated film ever made. The sheer imagination, artistry, and detail in every frame of this work is breathtaking. I applaud Miramax for leaving the American release unedited, both for length and content.Of course, serious fans of Japanese animation will be watching the subtitled version in the original Japanese language.  But given that the majority of American viewers will go with the default dub, a few comments on that version are in order.  The voices are a mixed bag; Danes and Crudup are merely adequate; nothing any competent voice-actor couldn't have pulled off, but a bit lacking in passion at times.  When emotion is expressed, Danes can come off a bit on the whiny side. Thornton's southern accent, though he tries to conceal it, is a bit distracting set among the visuals of historical Japan. Minnie Driver and Gillian Anderson are both quite good, however, and bring great gravity and dimension to their roles. Flawed as it is, it still stands as one of the best dub jobs imported anime has to offer (though not up to the standard of the excellent Akira dub on the special edition DVD).Thematically, this is like a return to Miayazaki's roots.  Its elements of man's declaration of war on the environment, and the environment subsequently fighting back are reminiscent of his first film, Nausicaa.  Of course, the animation, breathtaking background work, and sheer attention to detail bring a level of beauty that Nausicaa couldn't match in its day. Also worth noting is composer and longtime Miyazaki collaborator Joe Hisaishi, who presents one of the best works of his career here.For fans of Miyazaki, the brilliance of this film will not come as a shock, but for everyone else, it should be quite an eye-opener. Just don't show it to your children expecting a Happy Meal cross-over with cute sidekicks and musical numbers.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","dwpollar","13 September 2009","1st watched 9/12/2009 – 4 out of 10 (Dir- Hayao Miyazaki): Complex and slow-moving battle between humans and the forest gods didn't really play that well to me. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I'm not that in tune with the Japanese culture, but I just have to call things as how I see them and this animated movie by famed director Miyazaki didn't cut it for me. I think the main problem is that he didn't make us care for the characters involved and any movie that misses this part, I usually don't recommend. Miyazaki definitely winds an inventive story with unique animation and interesting demons and creatures as he usually does but the heart comes across missing. The story is about a group of humans who want to take the forest back from the animal gods who currently inhabit it and sometimes cause havoc with they turn into demons. This situation occurred early on and the prince of the story becomes infected to the point of having a curse on him that will eventually cause him to die. He's sent west to a forest area to hopefully get cured by the Deer God. He then meets up with Princess Mononoke, who is a half-human, half-wolf protector of the forest and tries to combine with her to help the cause, eventually. Battles ensue, and we do end up getting a happy ending – which we knew we'd see eventually, but two hours of the preparation for it was too much for me. I think the purpose of the story was to get us to see how we need to protect the forest, which I think we know, but the slow moving narrative ruins the purpose. So, a beautiful film again by the director but this one didn't hit home.","

This was the subtitled version and I really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, Film 4 chose to show the dubbed version of ""Princess Mononoke"", presumably because it was broadcast in a prime time slot. Despite a script treatment by talented fantasy author Neil Gaiman, the dialogue was pretty lame in places. Some of the so-called voice talent was pretty poor as well. Minnie Driver must have literally phoned her performance in as Lady Eboshi, her voice registering as much emotion as an automated response. Jada Pinkett Smith sounded pretty incongruous as a Japanese iron worker and Billy Bob Thornton just didn't work as the sort-of villain. I enjoyed what I could understand of the plot and the imagery and production design were wonderful. I'd give the original Japanese version (subtitled in English) an 8 but the American dubbing drags ""Princess Mononoke"" down to 6.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","the_horned_owl","14 April 2016","If I had to summarize this movie in a few words, I would say – Breathtaking, Magnificent, and Brilliant. It is one of my top ten favorite films. One of the many things that make this film great is the story. The film is set up in the Iron Age in ancient Japan when the humans used to live in harmony with nature. But the discovery of Iron and selfish nature of humans led to the mass production of weapons which altered this balance. Princess Mononoke is a movie about Nature versus Humans. It also takes elements from Japanese myths and folklore and shows us the great ancient Japanese culture.The opening scene of Princess Mononoke is jaw-dropping. In the beginning, we see a strange creature and thousands of snakes (or whatever it was) coming out of his whole body. This strange creature goes berserk and tries to wreak havoc upon a nearby village. A young lad named Ashitaka tries to stop him from going to the village and send him back to the forest but things go wrong and Ashitaka kills the Creature. The strange snakes grab Ashitaka's hand and leave a mark before vanishing into thin air. It turns out that the creature was a giant Boar who turned into a Demon God. He was cursed and the curse of the Demon God was now transferred to Ashitaka.They find a metal piece in the remains of the Boar and come to know that someone shot the boar with a gun and that is why his agony and hate for humans turned him into a Demon God. Ashitaka, knowing that he has only a few days to live, goes out on a journey to find the person who shot the Boar and was responsible for this heinous act. This journey leads him to the west. There he meets Lady Eboshi who rules a piece of land called Ironworks and was responsible for the Boar's death and Ashitaka's curse. She has thousands of workers working under her. She knows how to make gunpowder and weapons which were responsible for the Boar's death. She does not hesitate to kill anyone who tries to stop her. She wants to rule the forest but is she a bad person? You will have to decide for yourselves because Miyazaki does not let you judge the characters easily.Ashitaka also meets Princess Mononoke or Mononokehime – a wolf-girl, born human and raised by wolves. She despises humans because she thinks that humans are filthy, selfish and pathetic creatures. She has vowed to kill the humans and take back the land of Ironworks that once belonged to the forest. She is always looking for the ways to kill Lady Eboshi and her people. Now what happens, you will have to watch that for yourselves. I am not going to spoil the film for you.This is just the basic plot of the film and let me tell you that the storyline is much more complex than this. There are so many characters and subplots and all the characters are well developed. Ashitaka's character has the proper depth, warmth, kindness, wisdom and courage whereas San's character is developed as an angry soul who just wants revenge. Lady Eboshi's character is given different personalities so you won't be able to judge her. You will also get to see the Deer God AKA the Forest God, The Spirits of the Forest, Humans, Wolves, Villagers, Boars, Apes and other creatures. Princess Mononoke is a story about how messing up with nature can lead to devastating results and it delivers the message successfully. The story is epic and the scale is huge, but the storytelling is what makes it brilliant. Miyazaki takes you to this great journey where you can feel everything. Any other director would not be able to achieve such depth and beauty. Miyazaki had a great understanding of animated films and that is why the people at Pixar and Disney worship him and see him as their idol.The animation work in Princess Mononoke is hand drawn and the result is breathtaking. The scenes that take place in the forest are outstanding. Each and every frame is having great details and beautiful colors. They pop out of the screen and make you want to live in the world you are seeing. At the top of that, the 3D rendering adds more depth and beauty to the handmade drawings. You don't just see the world of Princess Mononoke, you experience it and live in it during the whole runtime.The score of Princess Mononoke is one of the best scores I have ever heard in a film (The Lord of The Rings and Princess Mononoke are my favorite). I have seen this film more than 5 times and I cry every time I listen to the Theme. Joe Hisaishi, you are a genius. Overall, Princess Mononoke is a once in a lifetime experience. I loved it the first time I watched it. Then I listened to the OST and watched it again and loved it even more. I love it more and more every time I watch it. So it is a kind of movie that grows on you after multiple viewings. I was not a lucky guy because I couldn't watch it on big screen but I seriously want to watch this in theaters even if it costs a hefty amount. You cannot go wrong with Miyazaki, can you? May his soul Rest in Peace.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","sme_no_densetsu","1 October 2008","""Princess Mononoke"" tells the story of a young man's journey to seek a cure for a curse that will eventually transform him into a demon. When he finds what he's been looking for he also finds himself in the middle of a struggle between the forces of nature and industrialization.The story is highly interesting and artfully told in a mature manner. The mythology makes for a highly imaginative story that is nevertheless eminently accessible. I have no idea what kids would make of it but, as an adult, I found it much more satisfying than the usual animated fare from America.I originally watched the movie with the English dubbing done by Disney/Miramax. At the time, my only complaint was that Billy Bob Thornton was badly miscast. Now, having watched the film with the original Japanese dialogue, I can't see myself wanting to go back to the English version. I watched a few clips afterward and the English dialogue just seemed forced and, at the same time, too Americanized.Visually, the film is splendid. The scenery is often quite beautiful and the action is generally well animated. Musically, the film is decent but not especially remarkable.In the end, when you consider the whole package (animation, voice acting, storyline, etc...) I think that ""Princess Mononoke"" makes a strong case for being Miyazaki's best film, though I admit that I haven't seen all of them (yet). This is definitely a must-see and not just for fans of animation.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","paul2001sw-1","5 December 2010","I'm not normally a huge fan of fantasy, or of animation; but I'm prepared to make an exception for 'Princess Mononoke'. And not just because it's absolutely beautiful; but more because it has a level of moral ambiguity not normally seen in either of its two genres. The story features a protagonist who spends most of the story watching events he can't control; a town inhabited by vigorous ex-prostitutes, lepers, and useless men, led by a fearless warrior queen but whose future depends on environmental destruction; awesome, but vengeful and frequently misguided gods; a girl raised by wolves who hates humans; and various squabbling animals. Even the villain of the piece (and this is surely an obvious parable for own own world) is less a figure of evil but rather a buccaneering adventurer who puts his own self interest above the greater good. At first, watching a version dubbed into English, I was put off by the non-Japanese voices; but in time, I fell into the world portrayed anyway. And when, near the end, with their fates hanging in the balance, the hero puts his arm around the heroine, I found it strangely moving in a way that I didn't expect to feel about what is, after all, just a drawing.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","stamper","30 April 2005","Generally I am a real fan of animated films and since Hayao Miyazaki's films seem to be of very high quality I recently felt to give one of his films a try despite not being too keen on Asian anime. The only film I really liked was Vampire Hunter D to be honest and I can assure you that I've seen my share of Manga 'classics' (Akira and Ghost in the shell). I had a feeling though that Miyazaki's films would be more mainstream Hollywood style, since he has become something of a trade name since making this film and the academy award winning Spirited Away. After seeing this film, I was somewhat disappointed. Despite the fact that the film had some of the makings of a great adventure film, I just could not get used to the many fantasy; god/demon elements. From the start I felt that the films core the film had a dangerous equilibrium, which it managed to maintain during the first hour. The first hour was pretty exciting and interesting but in the second hour the weight on the 'boring' scale just got bigger and bigger. It was not as if Miyazaki did a bad job directing, but I felt that he put too much weight on the whole moral/mystical part of the film where more emphasis on the action would have made the film tighter. Maybe though it wasn't the emphasis alone, I also felt that some of the scenes were excruciatingly long. Or maybe it is safe to say that I'm not into the whole Asian 'spirit thing'. I mean I didn't like The Ring or Ju-On one bit and I didn't care much for this one either. The only thing I actually can appreciate in Asian (specifically Japanese) films is the amount of violence they use and the way in which it is often comic. There were a couple of instances in this film as well where I felt the violence was so over the top that it became funny. Too bad that isn't enough to keep a film interesting for 128 minutes. Miyazaki should have kept this one standard Disney-length (with a maximum of 85 minutes).5,25 out of 10 post scriptum: the English subs were really bad, cause last time I checked 'arigato' meant ""Thank you."" and not ""Good luck.""","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Rebochan","25 June 2001","Yes, you read that right.  And the irony is that Disney brought it over.  It bombed thanks to them, because they realized that the movie was not typical kiddie krap-no songs, the cute creatures don't even talk (they click and fortunatly don't distract), and there's no hit-you-over-the-head moral in it.  Simply put, this is the best movie ever made, animation or otherwise, and Disney couldn't handle that.The characters in this film have incredible depth that even live-action films don't attain.  There's no characters that are outright good or bad. Eboshi at first glance would be the haughty villainess, but while she does commit evil by killing the gods, she also does great good by buying up the contracts of women forced to work in brothels and caring for lepers without even fearing for their illness.  San, whose name is the ""Princess Mononoke"" of the title (Trivia: Mononoke means ""Ghost"" a name that shows the depth that Hayao Miyazaki uses in his films), while she is trying to save the forest, is quite bloodthirsty.  The gods, who protect the forest, are also very warlike, and despise humans.  The fact that there is no real line of good or evil in the movie is what makes it so powerful.That is not to say the animation isn't impressive.  They pushed the limits with this one-the final sequence with the mutated Deer God is so real you forget that your watching a series of drawings that are only an illusion of motion.  The worm demon-gods would be impossible to create in live-action-only the realm of animation make them seem plausible.This movie proves what animation can do, and also shows a sad fact-while animated films have been around for about a century, their potential has been severely overlooked to the point where the most crude of drawings and pointless of plots are considered to be ""art"" and are relegated simply to the realm of ""mindless kids entertainment"" (or worse-EDUtainment:P).  Disney would do well to learn, but they haven't-they're still not releasing the other Miyazaki films they bought the rights to.  Perhaps they realized that if people saw how bad their own animation hsa become that they'd have to spend the extra time to make GOOD movies instead of the mindless drivel or pathetic made-for-video sequels (Little Mermaid II anyone?) they keep pushing out to us.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Jeremy_Urquhart","22 August 2022","This was the second film in a double feature watched at my local cinema tonight, with the first being Akira. I think I may have preferred them in the other order? My general preference is to have the faster paced and/or shorter movie of the two in a double feature go second, but Princess Mononoke following Akira still worked alright.I do think this is Hayao Miyazaki's best movie, and I think at this point I've seen all the features he's directed, too. It's got those unique visuals and characters that only he could ever come up with, and it's surprising that such a rich and intricate world has only been explored in one movie (surprising in a good way. I think the fact there are no sequels or spin-offs or prequels make Princess Mononoke feel more special, and watching it today made me wonder whether the film would be left alone as its own thing, if made today).Miyazaki movies leave me a tiny bit cold when it comes to characters and story, but I feel that the least here. I don't think his films get to me as emotionally as they do other people, but Princess Mononoke is probably the one that comes closest for me at least. The story is well told and the environmental message really comes through, and even if the ending feels a bit rushed, it still hits hard and feels appropriate.It's also just a beautiful movie to look at and listen to, and much like Akira, the world is so awe-inspiring and an experience in itself to witness. Even if Princess Mononoke isn't one of my personal favourite animated films, I still really like it, and understand its status as a classic.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","dee.reid","12 August 2005","""Princess Mononoke"" is Japanese animation at its peak. It's full of dazzling visual delights, kinetic action, magic, mysticism, epic-level storytelling, and it is frankly quite difficult to not get swept up in it all. It made me laugh, it made me cringe, it scared me, and it moved me and it touched me, deeply. This is one of the most thematically deep and touching animated pictures I've ever seen. Lastly, it's also one of the most violent.Now I don't mean ""Princess Mononoke"" is violent in the same sense most Anime' is. This is not a 134-minute gorefest; it's ""PG-13,"" for crying out loud! But yes, people do get impaled, shot with arrows and bullets, forest animals transmute into swirling masses of life-sucking snakes and the blood does flow, but it is all done in a fashion that drives home the point of man's eternal conflict with nature.It helps to realize that Japanese animation is a lot more complex and daring than American animation cinema. The Japanese animators put forth enormous effort and strive for absolute perfection in their cinema, which places it on a level that will never be reached here in the United States.With that said, director Hayao Miyazaki, who is one of the most revered animators not just in Japan, but in the whole world, personally saw to it that ""Princess Mononoke"" made a successful transition from the drawing board, to the big screen, and finally to Japanese and American audiences. And in relaying ""Princess Mononoke's"" epic vision of man's conflict with nature to American audiences, comic book artist Neil Gaiman wrote the English script, and a fine cast of talented actors were brought in to voice the characters. Of course I'm talking about Billy Crudup, Gillian Anderson, Claire Danes, Minnie Driver, Jada Pinkett Smith, Keith David, and Billy Bob Thornton.Set in medieval Japan, the film opens (after a lengthy narration by David) at a small village that's fallen under attack from a mysterious creature that emerged from the dense forest outside its borders. The daring and heroic Ashitaka (Crudup) takes on the animal, a giant boar amassed by hideous snake-like creatures. It's defeated but in doing so, however, Ashitaka is wounded - his right arm badly scarred.The wise woman in his village reveals to him that he's fallen under a curse as a result of his battle with the boar. The boar, which was once a forest god, had been transformed into a demon as the result of being wounded by an iron bullet found in its skeletal remains; the bullet then drove the boar mad, sending it on a killing spree throughout the forest. And because he had fallen to the creature's curse, Ashitaka is forced to cut his top-knot and leave the village forever. His journey: to venture to a far off place in an attempt to find a cure for his curse.Accompanied by his loyal elk-like steed Yakkuru, he goes off. He stumbles onto Iron Town, a mostly female-run colony that serves as an iron processing station, and it's run by Lady Eboshi (Driver), who has a sort of trustful mother-like relationship with the women workers (many of whom are mostly former prostitutes) and an uneasy alliance with the male workers.Lady Eboshi is a strong and determined female, the likes of which is rarely seen in Japanese animation. She has surrounded herself with loyal workers that she treats with the utmost respect, and she commands enormous respect too. I really like Miyazaki's treatment of her character, and a great amount of admiration can also be laid upon one of her most trusted women - Toki (Smith).But Lady Eboshi is at war with the forest gods, in particular the wolf clan (which is headed by Moro - voiced by Anderson - and her adopted human daughter San - voiced by Danes) and the boar gods roaming outside the colony's gates. Her iron works is destroying the forest and the gods living there are angry. Lady Eboshi thinks it will all end if she is able to capture the head of the Forest Spirit, the spectral entity rumored to control all life in the woods where most of this conflict is taking place, and she aims to do it with the help of a lowly hunter named Jigo (Thornton), whom Ashitaka had encountered earlier on his journey to the colony.""Princess Mononoke"" is a wondrous achievement in animation. It's breathtaking, with an amazing story about the rise of technology, man's embracing of it, and the war it surely enough started with nature. ""Princess Mononoke"" carries the same weighted messages you might find at any ecological protest here in the U.S. but it's done in such an even-handed and fantastical fashion that you can't help but be taken in.The animation is flawless, as I read Miyazaki personally redrew over 20,000 cells. The voice actors do a tremendous job of translating Miyazaki's words and relaying it to us for consumption and comprehension. I first saw this film back during the summer of 2001 and I easily remember the feelings I had when I viewed it. It was one of the most stunningly realized animated pieces I'd ever seen, as it made me understand the true power of animation, in any form.It's one of my top favorite Anime' films, as Miyazaki would surpass it in 2002 with his superior epic ""Spirited Away,"" which rightfully earned the Oscar that year for Best Animated Feature. Hayao Miyazaki is currently one of the greatest animators, as he has made one of the most beloved Anime' films of all time. It's my thoughtful prediction that one day he'll make a superior animation piece that could be the one to top them all off...10/10","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Enchorde","11 March 2007","Recap: Suddenly a great monster leaps out of the forest attacking the village. Ashitaka, with a steady hand on his bow, slays the monster but is at the same time stricken by its curse. He must leave his village and travel far to find the Deer God, deep in his forests, and hope that the Deer God will save him. Once there, he finds that humans and animal gods are fighting. Humans are destroying the forests in the process of gathering iron and the animals are fighting back. In the lead is the wolf Moro, her two cubs and Mononoke, a girl raised by the wolves. Ashitaka finds himself in the middle, and also find himself attracted to Mononoke.Comments: Rather good actually. The tempo in the movie is not high, but not so slow either that you get bored, a problem I find with a lot of other animés. I also liked the story, as it really had a beginning, a comprehendible and motivated plot, and an end. But it still is an animé where the scenery takes much space and focus in the movie. Small creatures that have really no place in the story comes and goes. But they never gets overhand over the actual story and just enhances it with some cute mystery. There evidently also is an idea with the story, a message but I will not comment further on it. So I haven't very much more to say actually as the movie to me was quite average. Pretty good, but not spectacular.7/10","

And remembering that it's produced in 1997, it makes me honor and respect this movie even... even better. The characters are lovable and hateable, that's how characters in movie should be like. Some characters are just so ""human"" I want to slap them in the face, and by saying some, it already includes the good and bad characters. And the imperfection of the characters stance, that is another element that makes this movie works for me.The storyline is not a plain one character's problem which is typical and weak, it's a multi-sided one that makes you able to view everyone's ""importance"" in what they are doing and therefore understand the ""why"" in their actions.Without forgetting that, what I love most from this movie is the fact that it encourages people to love the environment and not being so greedy with our human's ambition, and it teaches us to understand that our prejudice about what we don't know sometimes is the thing that makes us do bad things, and it shows why people do some bad things and why war happens and... oh my, I can't arrange the right sentence of how great the movie is.Just watch it!!!","

Princess Mononoke is no exception to this kind of discovery. James Cameron got inspired by this movie, and then made AVATAR.The film is set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. Just kidding. It's set long ago in Japan when the land was ""nick-named"" the ""Land of the Gods"". The movie has an instant start. It's one of those good instant starts in a film; it doesn't rush itself.When I saw this movie on DVD for the first time last year, I was blown away by how unexpectedly good it was. Hayao Miyazaki has to be one of the film worlds top geniuses. I haven't seen My Neighbour Tottoro, but I plan to do that soon. This felt something like Spirited Away mixed in with Lord of the Rings, mixed in with a John Ford western.The main character Ashitaka encounters an evil god which he has to kill at the beginning of the movie, but the god wounds him giving him an infection that gives him mysterious superpowers. Later he encounters the titular Princess Mononoke, the girl raised by wolves. This movie shows A+ character development, drama and animation.That's all for the plot. The movie was awesome in all aspects, using the technique of a film genius.

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","WondrousMoose","18 July 2017","In a cinematic landscape inundated with sequels, reboots, and adaptations, it's refreshing to step back a decade or two and watch something wholly original and incredible. Princess Mononoke was Hayao Miyazaki's seventh feature film and remains the longest that he has directed. At 134 minutes long and with a story as grand as the world it depicts, Mononoke is far from the standard animated output of either the US or Japan. This one is violent. It is epic in the truest sense of the word. It shows us all the world in which we live, only completely different, and it does so brilliantly.We hear two distant drum blasts, and the film opens on vast, forest- covered mountains. Trees fall and plants die as a monster passes through the them. This, we learn, is an angry demon in the form of a giant boar, and it charges to attack a nearby settlement. Prince Ashitaka (Matsuda/Crudup) meets the monster outside of his village and defends his people from it, but not without sustaining a cursed injury. He must leave his village and head west to search for a cure.As he travels, he comes to Iron Town, which is under constant attack from the forest that it has been destroying. Leading this attack is San (Ishida/Danes), a human girl who was raised by a wolf deity and has vowed to kill the town's matriarch, Lady Eboshi (Tanaka/Driver). As the conflict escalates far beyond the town's mountain, Ashitaka must choose where his allegiances lies and how he can end the war.I consider this to be one of the few truly great, mainstream environmental films. Its treatment of the nuanced issues at hand is equally nuanced, and unlike the easy ""nature good/people bad"" moral of so many others, Mononoke is able to leave us with the message that there is a balance that must be maintained. Humanity will always develop and progress, but it must do so with the knowledge that our lives and our resources all depend on the world that we inhabit.This film pulls no punches. Limbs and heads are shot clean off, and hard questions don't get easy answers. Perhaps most challenging, though, is the character of Eboshi. She acts as the antagonist of the film but is benevolent toward those in her town, buying prostitutes out of nearby brothels and offering lepers employment and respect. She is destroying the environment surrounding her land but all for the sake of her people. The cultures and relationships depicted in Princess Mononoke are uncharacteristically real for a blockbuster release.Mononoke's animation is top-notch, even compared to Miyazaki's other works, as the landscapes, characters, and monsters are given incredible life and depth throughout. Joe Hisaishi's score is epic and has got to be among the greatest scores in an animated feature. The sound design as a whole is incredible; through it you can feel every arrow landing around you and smell the dust as it flies up from the feet of Ashitaka's elk. Princess Mononoke was supposed to be its director's last film, and while I am glad that he changed his mind, this would have made for a fine final work.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","jakimiku","28 March 2010","I first saw this film some years ago and it instantly became one of my favorites. It simply has one of the most beautiful plots. I am truly fond of Miyazakis creation and Princess Mononoke is by far his greatest film.The ""ground-breaking motion picture"", as it is described in the trailer, is about a young prince, Ashitaka, finding cure to a deadly curse put on him by a giant demon boar. On the road to salvation he meets Princess Mononoke (San the wolf-princess) and Lady Eboshi the mistress of the Iron town, who is on a campaign to destroy the forest gods for richness in the ground. As Ashitaka is torn between a brutal war between the forest and humans, he tries to make the right decisions and falls in love with San. The film is really about the conflict between nature and civilization. Somehow i feel that Mononoke has such a great story and that Mr Miyazaki has come up with something absolutely extraordinary.The animation itself is beyond doubt, exceptionally amazing. The little details of the forest and its creatures, the whole nature, is just astonishing. Disney and Pixar have a lot to learn and bow down to. The character development is pure and believable. There is no clear villain: everything has both evil and good inside, and that's what makes the story so good. You watch the movie and its magic just absorbs you into the films depth. The soundtrack too, is great and flows with haunting beauty.I truly believe that Princess Mononoke is the best animated movie of all time, it is just so good. The film touches you and makes you forget everything else. It brings a great message and is a masterpiece. The most beautiful picture i have ever seen.","

It is odd obviously seeing how it is anime and if you seen anime you know the story lines are strange but this one is not so crazy.On a journey to find the cure for a Tatarigami's curse, Ashitaka finds himself in the middle of a war between the forest gods and Tatara, a mining colony. In this quest he also meets San, the Mononoke Hime He soon sees hes stuck between sides.This movie is really good. Like I said it is a bit strange so a lot of people will be turned off because of it but if you like anime and then you will know what to expect and you will love this movie for sure.","

Spirited Away is also another excellent movie, as is Kiki and yes, I am a 40 year male. But I like nice stories and Kiki was that, a nice story.Everyone raves about this movie and maybe that was the problem, maybe my expectations where too high. I have seen a number of Studio Ghibli movies and had enjoyed most of them (except Tales of Earthsea). But I'm sorry, but this movie sits with that one, at the bottom. The story dragged on and on and really, none of the characters where really likeable. It was way more violent than I was expecting too with severed limbs and decapitations etc.It's probably the whole underlying environmental fluff that made me dislike it so much. The ""anti-human"" tone was annoying. I think I also got annoyed with the back and forth of, this person is bad, these wolves are bad, now everyone is good and now they are bad again. Pick a lane.Anyway, I'm obviously in the minority in my view of this movie. Like I said, love a lot of Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki movies. This one, certainly isn't one of them. Do yourself a favour and watch Laputa, Castle in the sky or Spirited Away. Much much much better movies.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","sadrec1","11 October 2004","Another film by Hayao Myzaki, Princess Mononoke is a prime example of what a skilled animator can do at the prime of his career.Plot: Like the best of his work, with the execption of Castle of Calligostro, is based heavily upon Japanese Shintoism and Mysticism. Myazaki was enchanted as a child by the traditions of his island country, and it has been an endless source of inspiration. Although a monotheist and a Christian, I enjoyed the film because the god characters, much like the gods of Homer and Aesop, act upon such human feelings as blind hatred and jealousy. Though probably unintentional, Hayao shows what happens when imperfect beings try to create perfection: a god in their image, male and female. The rest of the plot is a standard Man-with-no-name wanderer-type story, whos travels to a mining town to find a feud he's caught in. More time could have been spent on the histories of Moro, San, and Nago, but in the end, Hayao creates an enjoyable time.Animation: For one of the first times, Miyazaki uses digital animation in his films, and very tastefully so. The forest is given his trademark another world look, which I cannot describe beyond it reminds of the Como Conservatory (minnesotans will know.) The Kodamas are adorable, and the animation of the Ape clan at night sent chills up my spine.Voice characterization: Like most translated anime, not perfect. Don't get me wrong, Billy Crudup is talented. Any Big Fish fan will tell you that. He just has trouble with pacing the translated script. He reads very quietly and quickly, lacking clarity sometimes. Claire Danes is slightly better, but still suffers. Minnie Driver, familiar with animation through Tarzan, is very good. The real gems, however, are Billy Bob Thornton and Gillian Anderson. Thornton, a musician, reads his script with amazing clarity and pacing. Jigo's, his character, mouth matches almost all of the time. Anderson, on the other hand, has one of the most beautiful voices of a animation vocal talent I've ever heard. Her haunting, slow reading of the words of the tortured wolf goddess Moro is perfect.Overall: Miyazaki has made family adventures with Castle in the Sky, growing-up films with Kiki's Delivery Service and My Neighbor Totoro, and even slick, 70s crime romps with The Castle of Calligostro. He successfully adds a Yojimbo feudal Japanese epic to his belt with Princess Mononoke.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","moribana","12 April 2001","Miyazaki-san has taken the soul of the Japanese landscape and its attendant Shinto mythos and spun a mighty tale.  It still has the wonder of his other features, but this one is different, mixed with a kind of Shakespearean grandeur and tragic intensity.  It's almost ruthless in its lack of sentiment, but because of this it achieves, at least to this viewer, a visionary breakthrough into unfamiliar territory.  This one will stay through the years and if you attend well enough, haunt your dreams.Kudos to Miramax for taking it so seriously and doing a good job with the dubbing.  Still, the American English just does not really match.  It is too laid back, softened and rounded.  It really dulls the impact of this film. The Japanese in Mononoke hime is quick and powerful, full of meaningful silences that the painting harmonizes with.  In English this basic rhythm of the film is all out of kilt.Anyway, you can tell I liked it!","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","anicerman","14 November 2006","This film may not be as fun as Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi and Howl's Moving Castle, but it's still my favourite because of the great plot.The film started with the Prince who gets a curse from ""boar king"". He then leaves the village to find a cure for his curse. Coincidentally he arrives at a iron-mining town and later meets Princess Mononoke on animals' side in the war between animals and humans. At last, in revenge for the death of the boar king, the boar god starts the war.You'll see there's much Japanese mythical imagination throughout the film, but it may not be the kind of film for family as you won't find much or even any laughter in the film but the illustration of the devil, blood and wounds. Anyway, Miyazaki tries to remind us of the importance of environment protection. Humans' greed may get the life-taking deer god's revenge in return.The whole film runs very smoothly yet slowly, but what I like best is the whole theme and also the way it's presented. You'll just enjoy the film itself as a kind of imaginative story, or give it some more thoughts because it's not usual to find many in the industry comparable to the works Miyazaki produces.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","blackmamba99971","12 April 2010","This is a great example of how the earth is so important. What we see is a land in Japan going industrial in the Shogun era. People under the tutelage of a woman who runs iron town. Basically a business woman who oversees her workers mining and smelting the iron to make fire arms or other forms of artillery. In the middle are two would be hero's, one is called San and the other Ashitaku, a lone man who was exiled from his village for being poisoned by a god turned demon. In his investigations he learns that the iron town was responsible for cutting down the trees and mining ore. But never gave back to the forest which made the gods angry. Seeing as the gods were going to battle, one lone schemer among the chaos only wanted the head of the forest spirit, to give his life a reprieve from the emperors sentence. Through it all San and Ashitaku try to achieve a goal of coexistence between the forest gods and humans, but all for not. Both sides went to war and the humans were winning their place in history. To see such grand scale imagery as well as a well thought out story I have to admit, this was a great teaching tool of ecological disasters. It was sad to see the forest spirit die to let the humans take their place alone in the world. To never again rely on the gods which had protected them for thousands of years or for that matter before time. But gods know that humans can endure the most riddled hardships handed to them, and must step aside to allow the human race to make mistakes themselves and to recover. I liked the way how the animals began to forget their own comprehension's and began to DE-evolve to ordinary animals of the wild. Brilliant picture, and brilliant cast.","

And there is nothing more to be said about it. Some will precisely say it's annoying to watch a movie (almost) everyone loves, but nevermind. More than ever the message of it all is so strong, so deep no one could forget it: The spirit of Nature lies way above our comprehension, but we despise and keep on killing it slowly. Period.

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Demetrius_Stork","20 December 2015","Wow. This movie blew me away, to say the very least. All of it was captivating; the animation, the characters, and story, all of it done to perfection. Hayao Miyazaki, whose work I'm only beginning to take notice of, is truly a genius in terms of bringing landscapes and it's many creatures to life.The plot revolves around Prince Ashitaka, who is told that he must leave his village and never return after he is cursed by a horrible demon. Ashitaka, along with his red elk, Yakul, sets out on a journey to ""see with eyes unclouded by hate,"" as he puts it and his journey brings him to see many things. He comes across a prosperous settlement that produces iron, fittingly named iron town, and its leader Lady Eboshi, voiced by Minnie Driver. Ashitaka finds that Iron town is at war with the creatures of the forest due to the human's attempting to settle in the forest to create prosperity, which of course the forest dwellers aren't happy about. Ashitaka later meets the princess of the wolf tribe San, who happens to be a human despite her title. Ashitaka becomes caught in the middle of a dispute as old as time itself, man versus animal.Several other characters are added to the mix; a strange little man named Jigo, voiced by Billy Bob Thornton, the lieutenant to Lady Eboshi Gonza, voiced by John DiMaggio (the voice of Bender), Moro, the god of the wolves, and Okkoto the god of the boars. These characters are all brilliantly written, and all have their own likability. One thing that this movie does well is that there isn't really any main villain. All of them have reasonable motivations behind what they're doing. It would have been so easy for this movie to throw in a tired message about how man is evil and how we should save the environment. Many may argue that this movie is trying to set up this message, but I don't think so. Lady Eboshi isn't necessarily a bad person. She's a strong person, who doesn't back down in times of adversity. She's a good leader who protects her people and only wants the best for them, giving a home to the lepers, fighting for the lives of her people against the boars, and sticking up for her fellow women's rights and honor. While on the other side the wolves aren't the villains either; only wanting to protect the spirits of the forest and their home from what they perceive to be their worst enemy, the humans. It's understandable why both sides feel this way, they all have a reasonable motivation and likability.The animation in this film is breathtaking, the creatures just fly off the screen with how they're drawn and how they move. The creatures in this world are all just so creative and beautiful in their designs. The Spirit of the Forest is one of my favorite designs in animation history, especially when the sun goes down. Even the designs of creatures that already exist, like the apes or the boars, all have a unique design and charm. This movie could honestly be watched on mute and still be thoroughly enjoyed.The story of this movie is unbelievably fantastic and deserves much more recognition than it gets in the U.S. It's a fantastic movie by a fantastic animator and is now, after seeing this for the first time yesterday, one of my all time favorites.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","KFstudios2009","4 September 2023","Mononoke-hime is kind of movie that I usually don't comment. But since this is a review, I have to tell you about my thoughts and general opinion. From Studio Ghibli, this is a very bad movie. From the beginning, I didn't like it, in the middle, I didn't like it, and the ending was just something that was a big disaster, really disappointing movie. It tells us that we have to protect the forest and that when you fight with a team, it is better than fighting alone. I think the message that they tried to show us, was good. The music soundtrack and a few of the action sequences were good. But about the bad sides, well, badly introduced characters, I couldn't enjoy them and learn more about them, they just went right in. The animation was poor, and believe me, I think anime animation is good, but in here, it felt incomplete and fast drawn without any potential. That annoyed me a lot, watching this poor animation. Generally, the action and the whole movie were too long, I really got bored the last 30 minutes or so. The animals, the voice-actors to the animals, were amazingly bad. Didn't fit the character's type and attitude. A movie that didn't entertain me very much. Very boring, weak animation, but some good action scenes and music sound were good. The moral about keeping and protecting the forest was good, But haven't we seen that before? Very weak movie, expected more potential, but got a big disappointed instead.","

So, Japanime isn't always popular with me, but I really like this movie. I relate to the main character because he cares about others and does what he can to help. And the movie showcases cooperation between animals and humans well... think horses. Yakul, Ashitaka's red elk, which looks like a Tauntaun from Star Wars, carries him from place to place. At the beginning of the film, actually, he is riding Yakul when Nago, a wild boar covered with a horrible spirit, attacks a small village. Ashitaka helps a small group of villagers escape from Nago, who looks like he is covered in a heavy, thick, amorphous black oil, but upon closer inspection, it looks more like a pool of worms. These worms shoot out of him like tentacles. A piece of the black spirit shoots out from Nago and strongly twirls, lightly grabbing Ashitaka's right arm. He pulls away. While a small amount of the sludge is on his arm, he is able to release an arrow into the monster's eye, killing him. After his first fight, as his arm rots, this wound glows and he needs help to heal it or else he will die. Find out how iron is killing the animals and see how Ashitaka helps save the forest while preventing his own death.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Nifune","1 November 2018","""Nature vs. Human"" is one of the central topics of this film. What many people misunderstand is that, however, this ""human"" (symbolized by ""Jigo"") includes most of the ordinary people in the world who live in a wood-made house, drive a car exhausting gas, and use plastic-made goods, not only the hopeless money-driven people who typically make a golf-course by cutting woods.From the bird's viewpoint, modern capitalism or neoliberalism is coherently and thoroughly criticized, for San (Princess Mononoke) symbolizing ""nature"" is consistently not compatible with ""human"" until the end. Ashitaka intends to reconcile ""nature"" and ""human"", but unfortunately, his way is to accept the conflict and discrepancy of them with his endless struggle. So the dog-god Moro strictly advised him to ""live"" beforehand.In the mid '90s, a continuous economic decline, ""lost 25 years"", were just beginning in Japan when people committing suicide were increasing in the locked-up feeling. On the other hand, people who lived in the Muromachi era around 500 years ago always deliberated their views of life and death facing daily deaths. The strong and catchy message of this film, ""survive"", thus having a double meaning, must be widely accepted 20 years ago.After 20 years still in the economic decline and left behind the global economy, Japan rather seems to recover its harmony with nature and human or anti-capitalism compared to that time. So far partly and still fashionable though, no golf and no cars, increase in young people loving more rural areas than urban ones, development of ecosystem such as electric cars, the advent of minimalism and sharing economy... probably these new trends would be life sprouts after their economic death as if caused by Shishi-gami!","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Jeremiah-8","29 November 1999","Hiyao Miyazaki brings his poetic sensibility to `Princess Mononoke,' the latest from Studio Ghibi. The film is an ecological fable about the conflict between man and nature, but offers no solutions or preachy messages like most animated films. In addition, it doesn't provide the usual scapegoats or easy targets we are used to. The genius of the film lies not only in its pure cinematic excellence (each image is stunning in its beauty and detail), but its willingness to provide clear and understandable motivation for the consumers/exploiters.Lady Eboshi (voiced elegantly by Minnie Driver) runs Iron Town, a mining village which is reaping its raw material from the Great Forest, taking it by force against the will of the Animal Gods, who battle to regain control over their habitat. Traditionally, Lady Eboshi would be an unrepentant villain who needs to be taught a lesson: destroy the environment and we destroy ourselves. Easy to say, right? Try telling that to the women who work the factory, who were once prostitutes before the lady took them in to work, or the lepers, whom no one but she would hire. Suddenly, the issue becomes clouded. And we understand that technology is both a friend and an enemy. Where would we be without industrial progress? (Miyazaki himself has understood in other films the wonder and glory of these advances, having a fascination for flying mechanisms which runs through his entire body of work.)However, industrial progress comes with a price, and the film unflinchingly portrays Lady Eboshi's cavalier destruction of the forests and disregard for the lives of the Animal Gods who live there. The Boar Tribe is almost entirely wiped out. The Ape Tribe is afraid to plant new trees for fear of the fiery man made catapults. The Wolf Goddess is dying from a poisoned bullet, grimly accepting her fate.San (Princess Mononoke, voiced by Clare Danes) is one of the key defenders of the forest, raised by the Wolf Goddess to despise all humans. The iron bullets are transforming the Gods into vicious Demons, wrecking everything in their path, and the damage is going beyond the Forest and Iron Town, into remote villages throughout Japan.  The film's protagonist, Ashitaka (voiced by Billy Crudup) comes from such a village, attacked by a mad Demon Boar and leaving him with a poisoned wound which will slowly infect his entire body and corrupt him. Ashitaka rides into town and attempts to bring both sides together in a compromise.As you can see, the mythos heavy plot requires you to keep up, but the film is consistently entertaining.  It features epic battle scenes which rival those of the master, Akira Kurosawa (an admirer of Miyazaki's work), and an understanding of how animals behave which is believable throughout (in body language, gesture and, seemingly, in thoughts.)  The adaptation by Neil Gaiman is remarkably vivid, unlike most translations, which seem to lose something special from the source. The voice characterizations range from excellent (Driver, Crudup, Gillian Anderson as the quietly ferocious Wolf God) to questionable (Clare Daines is a bit too cutesy as San, and Billy Bob Thornton is at first seemingly a strange choice as Jiro, a sneaky monk, but neither of them are too distracting. Billy Bob actually grew on me.)`Princess Mononoke' was one of the finest films I've seen this year.","

The animation work is great and rich in details, again as always from Studio Ghibli. But especially I liked how this movie contains some of the most beautiful still set drawings of backgrounds. As stills, they look so realistically beautiful, which also a bad side that it makes the foregrounds and moving animations seems too distinctive and don't blend well.

But it's not a favorite of mine. The movie's certainly ambitious, once again tackling an ecological story and adding a sense of ambiguity; good-and-evil isn't so simple, and the real struggle is for a balance between industry and nature. My problem (and I speak solely for myself) is that I couldn't get ""Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind"" out of my head for most of this runtime. And I think that that film is entirely more potent with a well-defined heroine. Here, there's a split between Ashitaka, Lady Eboshi and Princess Mononoke, and even though the tone is definitely more adult (with the violence to match), the prior movie had the more effective characters. Is that fair? Maybe not, but again, it's just me. But like I said before, this is impressive on a technical level. 6/10","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Sankari_Suomi","15 July 2017","This haunting tale of two young hearts trapped in a world gone mad will linger long after you've turned off the TV.The art style is classic Ghibli: fluid movement, realistic proportions, a strong moral component and the traditional clash between noble protagonists and immoral antagonists.That said, it's also pretty dark. Mononoke Hime revels in scenes of wanton violence, involving severed limbs, decapitated heads, copious amounts of blood, and that old Japanese favourite, the orifice-probing tentacle. Perhaps the boldest aspect of the story is its lack of a clear victory for the hero. Resolution is achieved, but it comes at a terrible cost. The most powerful character—a nature god—is presented as benevolent, yet seems almost indifferent to the plight of the forest creatures that worship him. His goals are clear, but his methods are harsh. He shows no interest in evening the score between oppressor and oppressed; he simply seeks to restore the balance, without any regard for the price that others will pay. There is no sense of fairness here. The deer god is an wild spirit; an animist's god from the ancient times. He does not issue judgement; he simply does what needs to be done. 'Justice' is a luxury for the gods of theists.I rate Mononoke Hime at 29.97, which works out as an orifice-probing 9/10 on IMDb.","

This movie is the kind of thing that Disney used to put out back in its glory days. Unique tale of man vs. nature stepped heavily in Japanese mythology. The characters are well realized and Miyazaki refuses to make them purely good or evil. They all posess shades of grey that you don't often see in characters in most modern animated fables. The English version of this movie is very well done. The translation is quite accurate and Neil Gaiman was the perfect choice for writing the English screenplay for a movie like this. The dubbing, which could've easilly killed this film, is good for the most part. The best performances come from Gillian Anderson (whose husky voice suits Moro perfectly) and Minnie Driver, who does such a fine job you don't even think about someone speaking with an English accent in feudal Japan.I'm glad to see this movie not only getting released in America, but actually being shown in theaters al well. This is a movie that should be seen on the big screen, as it best delivers the full visual effect. I really hope that Miyazaki makes another movie.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","toqtaqiya2","19 October 2010","Director Hayao Miyazaki spent twenty years considering the story that would eventually become Princess Mononoke, transforming it from something more obviously linked to fairytale and folklore into a passionate plea for us to learn from history instead of simply repeating it. It's an uncomfortable film, full of ambiguity. Ashitaka is the perfect hero, brave, strong, unpretentious, and kind, yet he kills when he has to. San - vicious, unreasoning, and utterly focused - ought to be a villain, but Miyazaki refuses to allow that simplistic label, insisting through each of his characters and their relationships that instead of name-calling we should be cooperating, because the only alternative is destruction. Princess Mononoke is a primitive film in many ways, both violent and pessimistic. The woodlands in which it is set are full of strange spirits and gods, beautiful, but threatening. The score by Joe Hisaishi supports this sense of threat, with a closing theme that's an eerie counter tenor solo that sends chills down the spine. It's also the first Studio Ghibli film to make extensive use of computer animation, a decision taken by producer Toshio Suzuki to meet an otherwise impossible deadline at the end of the three-year production process. Unlike other Miyazaki films this one is not for small children - there's too much violence, bloodshed and death for that. It's a complex, legendary tale, but one that is easy to follow, thrillingly exciting, and never less than beautiful to look at - like a detailed painting brought to life. Though it was Miyazaki's subsequent effort, Spirited Away (2001), that won the Oscar, Princess Mononoke is probably more worthy of it.","

While certainly a well-animated and relatively unique picture, Mononoke Hime is far from a great picture.It suffers from too major problems: Corny dialogue and pointless elements. While the first might be do to poor translation, the second surely is not. Ideas are introduced but not developed several times.  Other apparent plot elements disappear without explanation, never to return again. 
Yes, there are much better animated pictures out there.  Antz, for example, has many significant advantages over Mononoke Hime.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","DonaldDooD","27 July 2014","Princess Mononoke is one of Studio Ghibli's most acclaimed films, only behind Spirited Away. And few films deserve so much praise. Princess Mononoke is beautiful, emotional, and surprisingly violent. When I first watched it at 13/14, it was like nothing I'd ever seen, and it holds up.Miyazaki's films, especially Castle in the Sky and Nausicaa, focus on man's relationship with nature. But in these films, its clear that the environmentally-unfriendly military men are the bad guys. There is little characterization to them. Princess Mononoke is the ultimate evolution of these ideas, where neither side is portrayed as good or evil. Lady Eboshi, the leader of the mining town, is callous towards nature, but kind to her people, taking in those society has thrown away. The gods and beasts of the forest exhibit similar love and hate. This balance makes the world more realistic, and the danger more terrifying. And while some sort of peace is made between the sides, Miyazaki doesn't force a perfect answer.But its more than environmental commentary. The animation is among the best. Combined with majestic backgrounds of nature and a dramatic orchestra score, only other Ghibli films come close to matching Princess Mononoke's beauty. The action is thrilling, with perfect dramatic tension and intimidating creatures to face against the humans. Its one of the hardest PG-13 films I've seen, so don't show it to underage kids.Princess Mononoke is an anime classic. Everyone whose a fan of animation has seen this film. I'm just another voice gushing over it. If you're not a fan of anime, I promise you it doesn't fall for its immature tropes. If a 9-star film had to be a 10, I'd choose this one.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","tomfry-10237","8 May 2019","Hayao Miyazaki isn't a name synonymous with fantasy epics grand and aggressive such as the Lord of The Rings, yet in a pleasant twist of fate it appears as if the renowned director has yet another genre wrapped around his finger, intertwining a vast yet personal epic with a profound message for the younger viewer in 1997's 'Princess Mononoke'.Suffering a cursed injury, Ashitaka, the last Emishi prince of the Emishi village, finds himself on a journey Westward bound to try and find a cure for his ever-worsening ailment. Along the way we meet a colourful cast of characters including the titular Princess Mononoke (San) and her band of wolves.Venturing into the wild Ashitaka discovers a town destroying the land around them, the home of the wolves, in order to develop iron, growing exponentially in power and wealth. Should this trope sound familiar to you it would be for good reason. For many years the issue of defamation of the natural world for the prosperity of humanity has been a frequently touched upon issue, yet from the get-go the beauty in this film is in its initial reluctance, and then outright refusal to take a side.The destructive mentality of the people of the ironworks is merely a community attempting to find its place in the world; they destroy to prevent themselves from being destroyed (as it is established clearly they are not the most powerful force in this world). They destroy in fear of being destroyed, in many ways a reflection of the aggressive animals they kill rather than a binary opposition. Following this train of thought, even the animals are not without fault. The forest is divided into tribes of different species, and amongst them it is clear that there is conflict. They bicker and fight all in a desperate bid to survive, much the reflection of ourselves.This conflict is centralised through our connection to Ashitaka whom from the first scenes retains a clear reverence for nature, smiling and gazing in wonder at its otherworldly beauty. He acts as us, the everyman, looking on in horror as two worlds that he adores and is familiar with crash together In fire and blood, a desperate bid for survival where no survival is guaranteed. He fits his role very well and plays off San well also, however if I did have one flaw with the film it would be that: in earlier scenes he seems to develop a connection with San that is only apparent to them and doesn't translate to the audience very well (yet one could always argue that the reason for this is as what they represent thematically usurps what they represent in emotional connection.)Speaking of fire and blood, this is by far one of the most unexpectedly violent Studio Ghibli films I have ever laid eyes on. From the first scene blood is abundant, limbs are lost and death reins over the land. However, unexpected as it threw me, out of place it was not. The violence perfectly reflects the theme previously mentioned; the disarray of the conflict at the centre of the film between the growth of industry and nature, senseless and heart-breaking.This profound melancholy surrounding the theme yet contrasts itself with joyous human moments sprinkled throughout the film in romance, friendship etc. all heightened by a mesmerising score and Ghibli's signature rich vibrant visuals, which both make the world we're exploring feel full, truly living and breathing.Princess Mononoke is a film which takes risks, hovering in-between the side of nature's right to rule and the roaring progress of industrialisation, yet never wavering in its resolve. It knows that the issue isn't black and white, with dynamic elements frequently affecting the actions of both man and beast, with violence resulting from confusion, and a sense of pensive grief hanging over the film. Through all this conflict, neither side overcomes in the end, with the beauty of life itself being the true victory, a truly profound message for both children and adults alike.","

The story is simple, modest and at the same time, groundbreaking and epic for its mix of reality and fantasy (actually the premise is very similar to Nausicaa's). The characters are also very simple. However you can't help but sympathize with them, even with the antagonists, each one of them is unique, well developed and with its own fundamented and reasonable goal. The visuals are simply stunning, I will go and say: the best the 90's anime have seen. This movie will entertain you and make you think, there's a lot more to it than gods, demons, ecological messages, smooth and violent action sequences or beautiful emotional scenes. Watch how every character's action in this story can affect everyone and everything around them.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","chuck-526","20 October 2009","Watching this classic hit Princess Mononoke now (2009) means DVD. The Region 1 DVD has lots of choices for sound, so you can either watch the ""American"" version or the ""Japanese"" version (or watch both or even switch), perhaps depending on whether or not you're an anime geek. The DVD has both the original sound track and the ""dubbed"" English sound track (and a dubbed French sound track too). It has two separate sets of subtitles, one also called ""captions"" that matches the dubbed English translation, and the other also called ""subtitles"" that are apparently the original transliteration from Japanese to English. (Be careful though that although both original and dubbed soundtracks are on this particular DVD, this is not necessarily true of other DVDs. For example I've heard, although I haven't yet seen for myself, that the only way to get both original and dubbed soundtracks on the same media for Ponyo is to get the Blu-Ray version.) The dubbing is very high quality. Although there are lots of opinions about exactly how it should have been done (or even whether it should have been done at all), it's clear it wasn't done ""in a hurry"" or ""on the cheap"". Although various people take issue for different reasons with different voices used for dubbing, the appropriateness and quality of the voices seem good to me.The original English subtitles are severely abbreviated, almost schematic. Comparing them to other translations available on the web (I don't speak Japanese) shows they're invariably much shorter. They minimally sketch in the story line while letting the viewer focus on the visual.One even suspects the original English subtitles weren't given careful attention, as frequently they are a bit awkward or stilted, and it seems they don't even try to carry nuances. For example, the Emishi village is led by an old woman; she helps think for the village, and when necessary she predicts the future too. The dubbed translation calls her the ""wise woman"", whereas the original subtitles call her the ""oracle"". Surely a better word naming a leader than ""oracle"" was available.A definite plus of the original subtitles is they're very good at conveying the (assumed intentional) ambiguities in the audio. Sometimes words can be understood two different ways, and every once in a while it's not clear which of two characters in a scene spoke some of the words. For example ""forget it"" can mean either ""you aren't understanding me"" or ""don't remember what you think you just saw"" (or both). The original subtitles are very good at conveying this sort of thing.You can switch between the various subtitles with the usual DVD button. But for some reason you can't use the usual Audio/Language DVD button to switch between dubbing and original; you have to go to the Menu, change the Spoken Languages setting, then select the Return to Film option from the menu.The music is almost exactly the same (except for translated lyrics) in both original and dubbed sound tracks. My guess (I don't really know) as to how they did this is the creators of the dubbed sound track had the complete original score, and had the whole thing performed again. The sound effects are largely the same too, although in the dubbing the intensity and timing of the sound effects are frequently modified.The English dubbed soundtrack is not just a literal translation, but is slightly different in quite a few ways. (The very simplified mouth movements of anime characters make it easy to change words, or languages, or even to make a silent character speak.) Types of differences in the dubbed soundtrack I noticed include: perhaps most importantly, the plot and symbolism of the story is made plainer; some of the dialog is a little more colorful; simple cultural differences are bridged painlessly (by contrast, more complex cultural differences are wisely ignored); ambiguous language is made clearer; a sexual innuendo (the only one I noticed) is softened so much that it disappears; and sometimes elements of the story thought distracting are simplified.And a very few times it appears the translators just plain blew it (or tried to change something I don't think they should have). When in the Emishi village the girl Kaya calls the departing Ashitaka ""older brother"" and gives him her jeweled dagger, the dubbing just translates the words literally, which means treating the girl as nothing more than a little sister. As a result, much later when San is given the jeweled dagger, she can't say anything more than ""pretty"". The original term though is one of those words that has both an archaic and a modern meaning. The archaic meaning is something closer to ""respected elder"", making it clear the girl is not his blood sister but rather his village sweetheart. And her jeweled dagger is a symbol of ""eternal love"", like a gold locket to Americans. Thus Ashitaka later giving the jeweled dagger to San plainly states his choice of his one true love. Unfortunately the dubbed sound track misses all this.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","x_manicure_x","14 August 2021","Got a chance to rewatch ""Princess Mononoke"" after years thanks to the Japanese movie theaters initiative to bring back Studio Ghibli classics to the big screen. I was surprised to find it way more mature, grim, and violent than I remembered.The film deals with the relationship between man and nature as a problem that cannot be ultimately solved. Mankind's instinct is to progress, destroy and conquer, but is ultimately doomed to extinction like any other species, no matter how advanced their weapons become. Nature, represented by the gods of the forest, can be dominated and manipulated by mankind, but still remains the only irrational force that can give and take arbitrarily. Ashitaka's position is neutral, he is just doing his best to keep living aware of his condition as a human being and avoid conflict. None of the characters is truly good or bad, but conflict is inevitable as part of our nature (corruption even drives Ashitaka to unwillingly kill people).The art direction is flawless as always, this time focused on the equivalent of Japan's medieval age and its animistic beliefs. Every Studio Ghibli film has its own unique atmosphere, but the mystic, grim mood of ""Princess Mononoke"" is still unsurpassed. Joe Hisaishi's soundtrack also heightens the epic quality and intensity of the film, with some of his most famous compositions. Gives me goosebumps every time.My only complaint is that, like in most of Studio Ghibli's films, the ending felt a bit rushed despite the long, slow-paced buildup.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","buzzerbill","6 January 2006","Last night I watched this film. Just before the credits rolled, one of my cats got up, gave a disdainful sniff, walked into the bathroom and into his box, and delivered his own large and malodorous comment.I have to go with my cat on this one. My immediate reaction to this film when it ended was, very simply, ""Great looking, but the dumbest story I have seen in a long, long time."" I have to admit to a few criteria here. I am not an animation fan. For me, animation pretty much begins and ends with Warner Brothers and Chuck Jones, who taught us all that pretty pictures and trembling leaves and water droplets always get trumped by a great script. Jones's best work, combining a linear and somewhat abstract style with high and low comedy, is the best. Disney--let's face it--is gooey. And many other recent animation hits have been 15 minute shorts exploded into features, like ""The Triplets of Bellville,"" which would have been far better if it had stopped after the first 15 minutes. (Okay, okay, I did like ""Toy Story"". And ""Fantasia."") ""Princess Mononoke"" gets points for two things. First, it looks good and often looks wonderful. Second, it does sustain itself for close to two hours. And credit is due for trying to be serious, while still catering to the core kid demographic. However, Miyazaki's script is, to put it charitably, a mess. Its civilization vs. nature theme is very, very tired, and most of the time it just does not make any sense. A single example: Forest Spirit's head is removed. FS turns into a Japanese version of the blob and destroying the forest. FS gets head back--dies and crushes Irontown--and the forest grows again. Someone please convince me that this can make any sense whatsoever. If you are going to the trouble of creating a film for adults with capital-S Significance, you ought at least to make your case persuasively. You can call it ecological consciousness; you can call it Shinto animism; I call it pretentious, ill-digested crap.This has been touted as one of the great films of our time. Sorry, this reviewer will generally agree with his cat's tribute. Seek it out if you are an animation junkie and enthralled with the techniques. I certainly cannot recommend it as a film.","

You know,having seen ""Howl's moving castle"",""my neighbour totoro"" and ""spirited away"" beforehand made it seem intense. but you know that's the only way they would've been able to illustrate how senseless human atrocities are. The first time I saw it,I didn't make much of it,but it kept playing in the background of my mind. And that's where the genius of it lies,in my opinion. I mean,any movie that keeps you thinking afterwards is a successful movie. My takeaway from it was,other than the obvious ""humans,stop messing with mother nature"",it was most importantly the terribleness -if I may - of hatred and anger. What I learned from it is that when people feel hurt,they can become toxic if they choose not to forgive and hold on to their grudges. Like, that boar literally turned to a demon and was infecting whoever came close to him because he let hate get the best of him. Also,it made me realize that,indeed,like the movie pointed out,hate does feed on anger and fear. Also,it highlights the idea that each story has two sides,and we should really drop our prejudices in order to make room for understanding. All in all,this movie is a piece of art that you don't have to understand or appreciate from the first time,but that gets many messages through.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","siderite","12 November 2023","This is one of the most celebrated Miyazaki anime productions ever and for good reason. In a way it's a simple story, a feudal magical plot where traditional Japanese folklore and spirituality clashes with the realities of being human. However the attention to detail, the way each important character is portrayed as main, with little to no judgement, letting the viewer decide who is what and which decision or path in life is better, that is what makes this film great.The plot goes like this: a prince from the East defends his village against a monstrous demon, thus getting cursed with something that rots him from inside out and eventually will kill him. The young man must journey to the West to determine the cause of the curse, the source of the mysterious iron ball that killed a god and perhaps find a cure for his curse. But upon reaching his destination, he gets embroiled into tribal conflict between multiple factions, human and spirits. Maintaining neutrality will take strength, or maybe weakness. The movie is such that you are free to choose any option. There are no villains and no heroes, just characters set on their path by their own beliefs and narratives.If there is something that I did not like is the name. The main character is not Princess Mononoke. In fact there is no indication of why she is a princess and for what and most of the time she is just a love interest and a secondary character. The lead role falls upon prince Ashitaka. Why was this not called Prince Ashitaka, then? Don't know. Also there is something to be said of people always killing minor characters and letting the major ones live or do whatever. A trope that I personally don't like.Bottom line: I was blown away by this when I watched it 20 years ago. Watching it again I wasn't as awed by the film, but I enjoyed it tremendously and saw it in a new light as well. Highly recommended.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","benkoferenc","31 January 2006","My favorite Miyazaki movie! Maybe not as good as Spirited Away, not as innocent as the Totoro movie and not as European as Howl's Moving Castle. Maybe that's why I like it! It's filled with excellent characters, beautiful music, outstanding animation, and so on. Sometimes less is enough. The other positives are maybe that it's cannot be fully understanded - that's what I love in Miyazaki. He never explains everything, never tells us what to think, but after one of his films, we always feel that we've learnt something very important. And the biggest positive thing in him: he still believes in hand-drawn animation, and all we should do is thank him every time he makes a movie.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","paulclaassen","10 February 2024","Ashitaka is a young prince who saves his village from a demon god, but he is badly injured during the attack, and the demon curses him. Unless he finds a way to lift the curse, he will die. In order to do this, he must journey to the far west where the demon comes from.And so Ashitaka's adventure begins. His journey takes him into the forest of the Deer God, filled with magical creatures. The Deer God is a mystical creature that looks like a deer by day, but transforms into a giant Nightwalker by night. In the forest, Ashitaka encounters San - dubbed Princess Mononoke - a young girl who's soul was stolen by the wolves. Now, she is nor human, nor wolf, and hates humankind.Nearby is Iron Town, where they mine for iron. Cutting away a great deal of the forest, they caused conflict with the boars living in the woods. The mining is lead by Eboshi, who was responsible for a giant boar, Nago, to turn into the demon god that attacked Ashitaka's village.As Ashitaka's injuries worsens, he is running out of time before he, too, turns into a demon. The film therefore becomes an exciting race against time.The film has a beautiful score and is wonderfully animated. It almost looks as if 'Princess Mononoke' could have been inspiration for James Cameron's 'Avatar'. As the film developed, it also felt like a 'Lord of the Rings' fantasy adventure. Japanese anime are nothing like Hollywood animation. Due to the film's violent nature I can't really recommend it for kids. This is also a long movie that might challenge a kid's attention span. 'Princess Mononoke' is for a mature audience.'Princess Mononoke' just gets better and better as the film progresses, and delivers a fantastic action-packed climax. This is an epic film well worth seeing.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","invisibleunicornninja","27 August 2018","When I sat down to watch this movie, I was expecting it to be some kind of masterpiece due to all the praise it's gotten. Instead I got a boring but beautiful piece of work that honestly isn't worth watching. Characters - None of the characters have any personalities or depth. Everyone has one motivation to do a thing because of the plot. There are no complex relationships or interesting exchanges between the characters. The villain wants to destroy the forest because she wants to. The hero wants no one to die because that's what he wants. The creatures want to protect the forest because they want their home to remain. It's quite unfortunate that the writers just forgot that to make a story interesting, everyone needs reasons for doing what they do and not ""because movie."" Plot - this movie's story is a bit vague and pointless. Basically some people want the forest to die, the forest is against this, they fight, no one wins. It's pretty simplistic and uninteresting. There's a pointless romance thing in there and some other random story threads that mean nothing. Animation - this movie is absolutely gorgeous. I wish that the animators could've animated something good. They're clearly talented and it's sad to see such talent wasted on such a garbage and meaningless story.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Schro","25 May 2008","This is one of the most overrated anime movies of all time. I think most of the high ratings comes from people who were either stunned by the animation or give it a 10 just because it's anime. If you don't believe me about the second part, just type in the name of any generic shallow shonen anime and I can almost guarantee it will have at least a 7/10 rating. *cue 1000 ""No this review was not helpful"" clicks* To get this out of the way: The animation is great and overall it's not a bad movie. It's worth a watch. However it's also really slow and dull in many parts plot wise. There are several times where I just wished it would get to the climax so the movie would end. The main characters are pretty 2 dimensional(San and Ashitaka) and I found myself wishing that the movie would spend time on the side characters who are more interesting. San is the heroine who was raised by wolves and hates humans. If you've seen any anime with a generic tsundere(Wikipedia if you don't know what I mean) girl then you basically know her character and everything she'll do right away. Ashitaka is the hero who really has no back story and has a painfully dull ""PLEASE EVERYONE STOP FIGHTING"" personality. The point of the movie, like a few of Miyazaki's other movies is that the environment is cool and we shouldn't burn plastic in our full size SUVs while spraying aerosol cans out the window. While that's not a bad message for a movie to tell, Princess Mononoke does it really heavy handedly and seems like it wants to make you feel bad for human progress.Anyway, most of this ranting is to offset the hundreds of ""THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST THING EVER"" reviews and I honestly don't dislike the movie THAT much. I just think it could be a lot better for what the hype surrounding it promises.","

It goes back to the struggle of nature versus man. Throw in some gods, demons, curses and magic to create quite a spectacle.I found only two major weaknesses in the film.1) Some of the voices for the English version are horribly miscast. I would rather have heard an expert, non-famous, voice actor than some of the star-studded cast choking their way through the dialog.2) The ending was rather weak.

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","SAMTHEBESTEST","7 January 2024","Princess Mononoke (1997) :
Brief Review -An outstanding achievement in telling a long-narrated fantasy through animation. Hayao Miyazaki Cinema has a separate fan base. Some of his films are hailed as all-time classics, and even though I disagree with it, I still found some of them really good, and some are very good. I don't want to get into the Miyazaki fandom battle and watch his films as a neutral because I believe I can't be stuck with one filmmaker and his style when I have 50 more and bigger legends from world cinema to explore. I won't even waste time mentioning his other movies and my views since I have already written separate reviews. Let's talk only and only about Princess Mononoke in brief. So, it's a long narrative, like I said, and that's what makes it different from other animated flicks. Hollywood has made us accustomed to 90- to 100-minute animated movies, and they have been highly impressive, especially Disney and Pixar. That's why Miyazaki cinema is different. He takes the story round and round, visits every corner, confuses you with over-the-head theories and numerous characters, and then adds human/animal emotions to it. Princess Mononoke is a fine example of that long and difficult storytelling. It's an outstanding achievement when it comes to execution and vision. The visual effects look real, not fiction, because the filmmaker has convinced you to believe in that fictional world. At the end, there are emotions that flow just the same through humans and animals' blood. It's a story of human vs. Animal, civilization vs. Forest, and it's all set in a fantasy world. The hero and heroine are both underage, which makes the story relatable to a smaller age-group audience. Despite the longer runtime and a few drawbacks in the climax, Hayao Miyazaki delivers an A-class product in his own genre. This one can be skipped by others, but not by those who love Hayao cinema.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","clarkaaron-98947","23 May 2023","Truly a fantastic movie. The visuals, the characters, the plot, soundtrack, all compelling. As I said, not only is this the best animated movie I've ever seen, it's one of the best movies I've seen period. Definitely a top 10 all time favorite for me.If any movie is proof that animation is a viable medium for serious films, this, along with Studio Ghibli's other great movie Grave of the Fireflies, is it. But not only is this proof that animation is merely viable - it is also a perfect example of how animation can sometimes be the better medium for a movie than live action. This would likely be cumbersome as a live action movie.Princess Mononoke is great because of its animation, not despite the fact that it's animated. The drawings of the wolves and landscapes and the Nightwalker are simply sublime. Add the fact that it's largely hand-drawn and it becomes even more awe-inspiring - this movie is art.I'd recommend this to any lover of great movies and would urge anybody with reservations about animation as a medium for serious, adult-skewing movies to give this masterpiece a chance.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","sophiavladimirovna","15 November 2008","It may be true that the only similar film I have watched is 'Sprited Away', but I think I can still say that 'Princess Mononoke' is something worthy of being called art. The plot simply glitters with such complexity, thoughtfulness, maturity and action, that makes even the best of Western animation seem like child's play. The story carries a powerful, yet not preaching, ecological message, asking the question of why the human and the animal worlds cannot live in peace with one another. And what is remarkable, is that there is no true villain: all the characters, as well as the storyline, are very ambiguous. Some of the film's beauty also lies in the fact that the action is NOT non-stop: it is often the quiet, tender scenes that capture the viewer's attention. The animation, being of course chiefly hand-drawn, is nothing short of exquisite. From the calm beauty of the forest pools to the smoke and grime of the iron factories, not a single minute detail is overlooked. The characters, be they humans, stately animal gods, cute but eerie tree spirits, hate-filled apes or simply mice, insects and raccoons, all possess a certain beauty and credibility that is not always easy to come by in this day and age. The soundtrack is spine-tinglingly beautiful. And oh, the power of the silence as the Forest Spirit approaches, plants springing up in his wake... However, I must add a word of caution: this film lives up to every ounce of its PG-13 rating. The story and visuals are dark, violent and disturbing at times: People and animals alike are slaughtered in vast numbers with arrows, rifles, hand cannons and mines; profusely bleeding giant boars are invaded by tentacled demons. Death, as well as rebirth, and the horrors of war, are recurring themes. And the film is over two hours in length, so some children may become bored and confused by the plot. But do not be put off by this: 'Princess Mononoke' is pure brilliance from start to finish.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","sol-","2 September 2017","Attacked by a wild boar and infected by the madness that drove the boar insane, a young warrior stumbles upon a war between human villagers and intelligent wildlife in this animated drama from the imagination of Hayao Miyazaki. The film benefits from having no clear-cut villains or heroes; both the humans and the wildlife merely want to use the same territory for their own means and the project as such comes with some positive ecological messages in terms of trying to be sustainable and live in harmony. The most fascinating character is the title one though - a human raised by wolves as one of their own. Oddly enough, considering that the film is named after her, the Princess is only ever a supporting character in the proceedings. Furthermore, the film only ever lightly touches on the intriguing personal identity issues that come with being raised as something that one is not. Fortunately, the infected warrior is a curious enough character with his resilience in the face of impending death that the film still chugs along well. It is also refreshing to see an animated fantasy film that dares to show graphic carnage in order further the story-line. If not quite as dark and impressively nightmarish as 'Watership Down', this Japanese offering certainly comes close to it. In short, this is a relatively engrossing tale if not nearly the best thing that Miyazaki has ever done.","

There is a general tendency among adult audience to not take animation seriously, but I would be shocked if this movie did not leave a huge impact on anyone. This is one of my first reviews on IMDb, this movie has to be watched and internalized by everyone who is concerned about her future. If anything can move humanity to not inflict further harm and damage against mother Nature, it is this movie. If mother Nature had a form,it would closely resemble what Miyazaki has created in this movie. Even the thought of this movie chokes me, the stark unending sadness truly captures what Nature's wildlife is going through because of human activities. If humans ruin the planet in the near future to the extent that it becomes unlivable for all, this movie has the exact elements which can guide us all.","

A masterpiece is ineffable, much more than the sum of its parts. It's not that every part of it is perfect, far from it inevitably, but the whole is transcendent, and as such it transcends even its own limitations and problems. The characters in Princess Mononoke are living and breathing, full of life and profundity. It is partly in the characters themselves, and partly in the way the movie gives us to understand them. Through voice acting (the English version is marvelous, I can't speak for the original), music, dialogue, facial expressions and body language, and more. The imaginary world's symbolism doesn't let us down either, as do most. It is wonderfully coherent and rich.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","matthewssilverhammer","20 July 2018","Don't be fooled by the outward appearances of Princess Mononoke. Don't be fooled by the Studio Ghibli tag, or the Disney distribution, or its princess-fantasy genre, or the animated format. This is far from a kid-friendly film. It's intentionally paced (aka ""slow), jarringly violent (decapitation, ripped-off limbs, intense physical transformations), and almost oppressively heavy in tone. It's also one of the most lush, colorful, and beautiful creations of Miyazaki's astounding career, combining his undeniable animation skill and boundless imagination with overwhelming success.
Oddly enough, Mononoke isn't our protagonist here. Instead we follow Ashitaka, a recently cursed Prince who, in his search for a cure, finds himself mixed up in a battle for the future of the forest and its inhabitants, both animal and spiritual. Its effortless mixture of compelling story, well-placed humor, naturalism and fantasy is like great literature, only told with unspeakably perfect hand-drawn animation. Each cartoon cel and 2D creation is given its own character, style and care. Possessed-like apes with blurry skin. Cute but unsettling forest nymphs with Picasso-inspired faces. Snake-like demons drowning giant boars, personified wolves and blood-covered humans with chaotic precision. 
Not that its all style and no substance. Miyazaki and writer Neil Gaiman are running the gamut on thematic presence here, much of which will be familiar specifically in the bible belt. Fate versus chance, the relentless power of hatred, the danger of false prophets, the difficult power of choosing good, life springing up from death, the frustration inherent in being an ephemeral creature. It's all presented with a wonderous mystery, only suffering from moments of over-explanation. Princess Mononoke represents an entirely imaginative spirit rarely surpassed in storytelling.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","drqshadow-reviews","25 June 2020","I'm convinced this is the film Studio Ghibli spent its early years building up to. While previous efforts like Castle in the Sky and My Neighbor Totoro contained mythical elements - sleepy deities, spritely spirits, magic-tinged talents - the influence of god-level beings often feels secondary, relegated to a few enchanting (yet fleeting) glimpses. In Princess Mononoke, such divine creatures are essential, active participants. They speak, argue, swing their weight around. We aren't left to guess about their opinions or motivations, because their words and actions carry such a resonant influence. It's mesmerizingly effective, a contrast between the seemingly petty concerns of human tribes and the mass and muscle of a much heavier entity.Mononoke represents a huge step up for the studio, particularly in that sense of scale. Rather than maintaining the quaint, intimate essence that typified their early output, this time Ghibli has gone sweeping and epic. Everything, from the ambitious, enveloping symphonic score to the wide, gorgeous landscapes and distinct environs, emphasizes this point. We've left the village to find there's a broad undiscovered world out there. Yet the distinguishing little touches and unspoken human gestures haven't been lost in the transition, either. It still looks and feels like a Miyazaki movie, calmingly earnest and heartstrong, but the canvas is larger and more potentially powerful. And man, do they make the most of that promise.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","dfranzen70","13 July 2016","Hayao Miyazaki, the animation legend who brought to you such awesome films as Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away, and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, strikes again with this eco-friendly tale about the struggle between man, animal, and god within a deep, dark Japanese forest.Prince Ashitaka (voice of Billy Crudup) of the Emishi, stricken with a curse foisted upon him by a rampaging wild boar that was possessed by a demon, heads west upon his trusty golden elk Yakul to find a cure. He's also out to possibly save his people, as the appearance of the demonic boar portends grave consequences for the village – the gods and demons are reclaiming the forest.Ashitaka attempts to buy some food in a neighboring town with a gold nugget, but the shopkeepers do not quite believe that the nugget is a valid form of currency. Our fair prince is saved from further embarrassment by a monk named Jigo (Billy Bob Thornton), who offers his assistance to Ashitaka. Ashitaka learns from Jigo of a town called (in the English version, anyway) Iron Town, since they mine iron. Jigo also mentions that the forest gods still dwell around Iron Town, a fact that is certainly not lost on Ashitaka. He heads out the next morning.Meanwhile, a long column of men and oxen, carrying rice back to Iron Town to feed the denizens, is attacked by two giant wolves – one of whom bears a masked girl. Leading the men is Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver), who orders her men to fire their brand-new muskets at the wolves. The wolves are driven off, but their mama, named Moro (Gillian Anderson) soon arrives and lays everyone to waste. Half of Lady Eboshi's men fall off the mountainside.Further down the mountain, Ashitaka hears the battle above and comes across two men in the river. He pulls them out (one unconscious, the other with a broken arm) and carries them both through the ancient forest to Iron Town. On the way to Iron Town, Ashitaka encounters the wolves and the girl by the river side. The girl is San, the Princess Mononoke, i.e., the Angry Princess. Why is she so angry? Because Lady Eboshi has been killing all of the animals, which has been causing the forest to fall into disrepair and has angered the forest gods. She kind of has good reason to be mad.The reception at Iron Town is mixed, as many distrust the newcomer Ashitaka. Ashitaka learns that everyone in the village helps mine the iron, with the women operating the mighty bellows themselves. Lady Eboshi also explains that San really has it in for her (because of the forest damage Eboshi's caused) and that when the Forest Spirit himself is dead, San will become human (although to the viewer she looks perfectly human as it is). San, raised by wolves, is not on board with this eventuality.All of which leads to everyone fighting everyone, with mass destruction guaranteed. Iron Town is under siege by Lord Asano and his samurai, who wish to control the iron ore. The Iron Town citizens are left to defend themselves against Asano while Eboshi and Jigo the monk seek out the Forest Spirit; Jigo has a letter from the Emperor himself that guarantees a large sum of money if Jigo can bring the Forest Spirit's head to the Emperor (who believes it will grant him immortality). Then there are an entire tribe of huge wild boars who want to avenge the death of one of their own – the boar that wound up cursing Ashitaka to kick all of this off – as well taken on the humans for being humans. Oh, and apes who also want to kill the humans, particularly Ashitaka, whom they want to eat so they can gain his strength.There's plenty of action, in other words. In fact, the violence is a bit more explicit than you might expect in an animated film. When Ashitaka is first dealing with his curse, he fires an arrow at a soldier who is attacking him; the arrow cuts the man's arm clean off. Ashitaka doesn't know his own strength, it would seem. There's also a fair amount of blood, and a couple of particularly icky scenes: one in which San removes a bullet from Moro by sucking out the blood and spitting it out and another in which San helps Ashitaka eat by first chewing beef jerky and then passing it to him by mouth (he's very weak, you see). I understand, but eww.Princess Mononoke has plenty of strong-willed characters, and many of them are female: San, Lady Eboshi, and Moro, plus Ashitaka and Jigo. The Forest Spirit is a wonder to behold, too, appearing to be part human, part ape, part deer, and probably parts of lots of other animals as well. And the visuals are about what I expected from the maestro Miyazaki, although I think they weren't quite as well developed as they were in some of his other works, like the earlier Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. And it's also possible that there are just too many characters and plot lines and conflicts in Princess Mononoke to easily track. But overall, this is an unquestionable triumph of animation.","

This was unexpected, so I spent quite a bit of time surreptitiously observing my 9 year old viewing companion for adverse reactions. We also had a good debriefing conversation on the way home from the movies. I feel confident that I did not return her to her parents scarred for life (once again >phew<). Apart from those concerns, both she and I really enjoyed the movie. The artwork was superb, the characters were well drawn, the action was fast paced, the suspense was compelling, the voice talent was superb. Truly, is there another studio that surpasses Ghibli in its field? I give the film an 8 (superb) out of 10. {Anime Adventure}","

""Princess Mononoke"" was no different. I watched an hour and 15 minutes of the movie before I got up and left the theater.While I found the look of the animation to be nice, the storyline was just to boring for me to watch any longer. Also, I only found the animation to be average. I bothers me that Japanese cartoons always seem to have a jerky, jittery look to them. There was nothing special to this movie. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't good either. I'll give it a straight down the middle 5 rating.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","dannylee-78082","4 January 2023","I was shameful that I called myself a Ghibli fan after watching Mononoke. I didn't realize that there were many other Ghibli films outside of Totoro and Spirited Away. I also was amazed at the depth of this film.Mononoke features a beautiful score and animation art as expected of the studio. However, it goes far beyond that and tells of a complex story. I won't bother explaining the detailed summary but will in a couple sentences. Prince Ashitaka tries to create a world where the natural world and the technological, industrial can coexist. It's open to interpretation whether he succeeded in that. What's fascinating is that this film does not feature a typical human vs nature environmentalism narrative, where humans are portrayed as the antagonist and nature as the protagonist. It shows that the ""human"" side is not only greedy and ambitious, but also compassionate and caring, characterized by Lady Eboshi. The ""nature"" side mostly is composed of suffering animals at the hand of human technology, but also features the ""God of Forest"", who ends up consuming most of the things in its way, hence also coined ""God of Death"".In this complex conflict, I resonate a lot to what Miyazaki was trying to say - ""Yet, even amidst hatred and carnage, life is still worth living. Is it possible for wonderful encounters and beautiful things to exist.""Nothing in life is black and white, even in this crusade for environmentalism. Princess Mononoke tells us to find the beauty in the gray and live for the wonder of life. Hopefully, I can live in that way as well.","

I swear the Japanese culture loses something in translation: the characters are so annoying. The Japanese probably like their young male characters to be all mopey, melancholic, effeminate, Emo's, and the young female characters to be clingy, whiny, immature brats! However, Princess Mononoke isn't quite as bad Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away, Ponyo, Tales of Earthsea etc, but it's still pretty bad. At least this one has something that remotely resembles a story and characters that (sort of) make sense (but they're still annoying as hell!) - heck, there's even a subtext!","

The chemistry between San and Ashitaka are perhaps the biggest of interests in the film. The artwork is meticulous. Studio Ghibli is employed with wizards of anime who always seem to blow us away with their style. Strong characters and dialogue.(all languages voiced excellently, by the way)And an intelligent, emotional story.(yet confusing for some)All together make in my opinion one of the greatest animated films of all time. Easily one of my favorite anime films. A must see for any fan of animation.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Squidd","22 October 1998","The king of Japanese animation displays his (as of yet) most carefully crafted work.  As in all his movies, the audience must be prepared to enter into a magical world, where the background scenes are beautifully painted in a realistic manner, but are imaginary and fantastic...  To be taken to a mythical Japan where wolves have two tails, where forests are inhabited by head-ticking spirits, and where boars can be cursed with hatred, seems at first to be an exciting adventure.  But we find that this world is all too real.  At the center of this epic is a battle between man and nature. People kill animals and trees... as well as each other.  Trees are burned for iron, iron is used for guns, and the guns are used for war.  People die, animals die, and spirits die.  But Miyazaki is a messenger of hope.  He claims to want to show children not how the world is, but how it could be. His characters are neither evil nor good, and so they allow for change. Disney could learn from this.  The magic of Disney lies in its abiltiy to tell happy tales of good people vs. evil people.  The magic of Miyazaki lies in his philosophy.  His love for craft, and his relentless passion for animation and story-telling allows him to produce movies that are original and breathtaking.  The effort that he places in the creation of his art guarantees that his work is worth watching, at least once.  And for that effort, we as an audience should put in the proper effort to try and understand what this director is getting at, as well as the effort of appreciating the animation itself.  There are scenes in this movie that Disney cannot do (at least not yet) simply because of the technique. Miyazaki deserves a place with the masters.  He has shown that animation is no child's play.","

Granted it's not as epic as ""Nausicaa"", the superb action sequences, the terrific accompanying score by Joe Hisashi, and the gritty harshness of its dramatic themes made ""Princess Mononoke"" a much tighter package, as well as a more elaborated version of the message put forth in ""Nausicaa."" I understand that Miramax's distribution and marketing of the film up to this point has been rather low-key, but I hope somehow this film will reach enough people to make a change in the mindset of the American public. A note to parents, this is not ""My Neighbor Totoro"" or ""Kiki's Delivery Service."" There is some violence in ""Princess Mononoke"" which may startle younger audiences.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Filmboy-14","21 January 2000","Princess Mononoke is the most breathtakingly artistic film I have ever seen. It ranks among Fantasia and Pinocchio as the greatest animated films ever made.  The story line is beautiful and complex.  It's not your normal, boring, conventional, and predictable Hollywood plot that everyone seems to want nowadays.  Some people had trouble with Princess Mononoke, I think, because there are no real good guys and bad guys.  You can't really take sides, every character has different motives with good and bad intentions. But that's one of the things I liked about Mononoke.  It's not the good old simplistic Disney tale where there is a definite good and evil.  Princess Mononoke is not about good vs. evil, or even man vs. nature, but about how we should all reach a certain compromise and try to work together and help each other.  You won't find too many themes like that in movies, especially animated features.  Princess Mononoke is not for small children, not just because of the violence, but because it will probably go way over their heads.  It is geared toward adults and older audiences.  The love story between San and Ashitaka is very subtle, moving, and even profound.  It's not conventional Hollywood.  Princess Mononoke is #1 on my ten best films of the year list because I believe it is a landmark feat in the animation genre.  I think it will eventually change the way Americans look at animation; that it's not just limited to the family and small children, but can be for adults and only for adults.  Mononoke shows that animation is just another form of expressive filmmaking, it can show things on film that could not possibly be filmed in live action.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","tuomas_gimli","16 November 2012","If Studio Ghibli's fantasy films were a menu, Nausicaä and Laputa would serve as appetizers for the main course which is Mononoke. It is a grim, adult fantasy epic which deals with heavy themes in a mature way. It doesn't ask simple questions, nor does it give simple answers and its only moral shades are of grey. It is fantasy fiction at its finest, and magnificently realized.Which sadly makes the few flaws it has all the more apparent.Mononoke has a theme of man vs. nature. However, instead of going the Avatar route, Mononoke presents both sides as fully fleshed out, and neither of them seems better or worse than the other. This is perhaps Mononoke's greatest strength: real-feeling moral ambiguity where wrong and right are shady at best.Mononoke has also a multitude of other things going for it: the animation and art are gorgeous, and don't seem dated in any way. The music is among Joe Hisaishi's best, and that is not something you can say lightly. The action scenes are perhaps the most visceral and thrilling in all of the Ghibli films, and Miyazaki's imagination outdoes 99% of mainstream cinema.Mononoke has only two major flaws, but sadly they can't be ignored. The first is the main characters: they're believable and well developed, but there's an odd lack of emotion to them. Ashitaka, for example, doesn't seem to display much else than cold indifference or steely determination. I also would have liked the hinted romance to have been explored a bit more. It clearly is there, why not go for it? The second, and biggest, problem with the film are its around last 45 minutes. In short, the whole story and all plot threads are solved in one long, intense action sequence which takes up most of the film's second half. The intensity is kept high for the whole time with little pause for breath, and eventually it does get tiring. I think it could have been done better. Also the ending feels quite abrupt after the long action sequence, as the ""what happened next?"" question is answered with only a few short scenes, and then we cut to the credits. There could at least have been an image montage during the credits like in Totoro.Recommendation: Despite my criticisms, Mononoke is in the end a great film and practically obligatory to see for any who consider themselves anime fans. Must-see for Ghibli fans, heartily recommended for anyone else","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","sharky_55","19 September 2017","Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke is big, brash and lyrical, bringing together several different ancient worlds into a new order where co-existence seems impossible. The film has been called the Star Wars of the east, but surely it is more than simply that, with a confidence and fluidity in its action-driven world building that immediately signals to us that these clans have existed for a very long time, and want to desperately continue that tradition. Then one day man discovered that iron ore could be forged into new and powerful tools, and the earth was broken to excavate it, and lines were drawn in the sand. Miyazaki has never been shy about his moral lessons. His debut Nausicaa, from way before Studio Ghibli was even established let alone a household name, pitted its eponymous heroine in a post-apocalyptic wasteland where toxic fumes (man-made, presumably) had corrupted nature and its beasts, and only underground gardens housed plant life. Here in Mononoke you can see its influence from the beginning, in the way that the boar god Nago has been corrupted by an iron ball shot into his stomach, and how the evil spirits writhe and attempt to consume him. Their movements, each individually hand-drawn, become a furious, teeming mass that is immediately reminiscent of the gigantic, mutated Ohm with their churning legs. Like the Ohm, Nago is an intelligent creature that has been reduced to baser instincts because of humanity's stain. The apes likewise have taken on a hellish appearance, and resorted to eating unnatural things. Made 13 years later, Mononoke is Nausicaa but matured in almost every way. You could never equal the original imprint of 80s tone and mysticism, backed up by a Joe Hisaishi score that found beauty in the strange, alien landscape (the haunting children's choir is a testament to that). But the allegorical tapestry of Mononoke has no animated equal; it attempts no less than to account for every horse in the race for the forest, and in doing so lifts early didacticism into a universal fable. Seeing it on the big screen for the first time, I marvel again at the artistry of Ghibli's animators. They twist beauty and corruption into one with their matte backgrounds; the whole damn world is under the curse of evolution and technological advancement, and the untouched nature is slowly bearing its scars. An early shot of an oxen delivery inching its way across a spiky mountain range and fog is reminiscent of the magnificence of Herzog's Aguirre, and how the opening dwarfs its tiny humans. In the midst of pure streams, still lakes and thick forests they draw cartoon violence that is undeniably shocking for the medium. Even Ashitaka trembles at how his corrupted arm lends him an otherworldly strength that allows his arrows to cleanly behead a chasing samurai. The pale Kodama seem cute at first, until they twist their heads all the way around and shiver, sending unease down our spines. And no one animates emotion quite like Miyazaki. When his characters run, they stumble and grasp for the ground, and almost leave skid marks turning corners. There's no run cycle in sight. Look how he evokes anger through the whole body; eyes widen, brows arch like caterpillars, hair bristles up as if charged with electricity. But nothing quite compares to the anger of the forest spirit in search of his stolen head from the invaders of his domain. Watching it I am filled with both thrill and fear; to have Miyazaki unleash the figurative fury of mother nature is to rebuke all previous images of the serene, gentle spirit. Does it simply give in to those who are poisoning the land? No, it has lived in peace for millennia and has not yet been challenged by individuals so powerful and careless at the same time. It launches a self-destructive last resort. It seeks to consume. There is Miyazaki's caution of the modern world, of its unchecked progress and uncertainty, but this time around he also sees how it can bring new life for those previously downtrodden. Lady Eboshi rescues the women from filthy brothels and gives them good, hard work, and entrusts to the marginalised lepers the most important job of them all. She is not simply evil incarnate, but perhaps short-sighted. Her arrogance in her tools leads her to believe that she can kill a god, and she loses a hand for this. But she learns, and the town grows again. Ashitaka and San are the ones to bring true balance to the war. San herself is a discarded product of the conflict, neither fully wolf nor human. She reacts initially with an almost animalistic, blind rage, like that Okkoto, who has been fighting too long to see sense. And in the end, although she comes to accept that their must be give and take for both sides, cannot forget what the humans have done on behalf of progress. It is refreshing to see a film not so easily discard its character's convictions. A western film might have poised the romance as dramatic resolution. Yet Ashitaka knows that such atrocities are not quickly forgotten, and that only time can begin to heal them. One day that seedling may become a tree.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","El_Rey_De_Movies","7 April 2008","Disney has always dominated the animation market here in the States with their popular, streamlined, well-crafted series of films aimed at children with a little extra thrown in to keep the parents interested. But it's a different story in Japan, and one look at ""Princess Mononoke"" will show you the exact reasons why. Whatever you may think about Japanese animation (or ""anime"", as it's popularly known), one thing you have to understand is that it's definitely NOT aimed at children, and that the level of animation is far superior to anything the House of Mouse has ever produced. This film, which I consider one of the greatest ever made, is the story of young Prince Ashitaka. While defending his tribe from a rampaging demon, he is infected with its' venomous hate. The infection is lethal, and the only hope for Ashitaka is to leave his ancestral lands, venture into the west, see what caused the entity that attacked his people to turn into a demon, and ""to see with eyes unclouded by hate"". His journey takes him to Irontown, a village of miners and metalworkers, and their struggle with the Great Forest Spirit. At that point, it becomes a moral fable about how humans coexist (or more often, fail to) with the natural environment and the price that they pay for trying to control the elements of nature. It's a tremendously fast-paced and exciting story, full of strong and well-rounded characters voiced convincingly by the likes of Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Gillian Anderson, Minnie Driver, Jada Pinkett-Smith and Billy Bob Thornton. The animation can only be described as jaw-droppingly beautiful. If you've never heard of director Miyazaki or have never seen anime, this is the place to start.","

I admire that the movie manages to contain so many story elements while it also keeps its structure intact. I think it struggles a bit with its pacing in the second act, but other than that, it's intriguing. It's my first animation movie that has such brutal violence and I love it. It makes the action and its outcomes much more realistic and darker. Although comedy isn't its biggest genre, it also has a nice touch of it because it decorates the story in an entertaining way. In terms of story, I think it has a good balance of character development, divinity, mystery and action. The world-building feels enormous and small at the same time, but it's the animation that mainly holds onto your attention. The movie also has a very good use of its sounds, especially when it comes to the epic action, like the scenes with the gods. So overall, this was a great watch!While this movie might stumble slightly in pacing, its breathtaking animation, immersive story, and impactful action sequences solidify it as a must-watch.

First of all what a brilliant animation (not like your Disney).The entire film was moving ,action packed and very well paced .And if u don't understand watching it first time its OK , give it a another try u will see a deep story and strong message in movie.Movie starts off with Ashitaka protecting his village from possessed boar/god during which he gets infected .Banished from his home town ashitaka seeks to find a cure for his curse before it kills him .He heads east to find forest god and ask for him to lift his curse but he gets caught in war between Tatara,mining colony and animals of forest lead by san,mononoke hime who is human raised by animals.Ashitaka falls in love with san and with people of mining colony but whom will he side with ??. well that's beautifully directed by miyazaki. The movie deal with both nature and humans.Even though Spirited away is my miyazaki's fav , princess mononoke is much more epic in story wise, animation,music,direction.If u haven't seen it u are missing true art ...!!!!","

I bought the DVD to this movie because I have been reading great reviews of it. I was expecting to be blown away. Unfortunately the movie is too confusing to be truly enjoyable. The plot is confusing and hard to follow. The look of the film is great, but without a coherent story it left me cold, so it went back to the place that I bought it from.

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","alasdairdavidson1987","9 January 2007","This film would be inside the top 10 films of all time were people in the west only more aware of it. In England we grow up on an unappealing diet of Disney tripe, but we don't realise it is so shoddy because it's all we have. This is because we don't have a strong animation industry of our own really, with the possible exception of Aardman Animations, and we are gripped by America's commercial stranglehold. The lower classes in this country love America and anything it produces, because they are ignorant, pure and simple. The sad fact is that the average person in the street has not heard of Studio Ghibli or Miyazaki. Consequently they think that Disney films are the acme of animation, and show their children Disney films and take them on holidays to Disneyland. It was such a revelation for me to see my first Studio Ghibli film (Spirited Away) and when I watched more of Miyazaki's masterpieces, most notably Mononoke-Hime, I realised what animation can and should be. There still persists in this country the idea that animation is somehow a lower art form than live-action films, but the more people see this film, the more things will change. Using animation allows a director to fly effortlessly into the realms of fantasy, and Miyazaki is masterful at it. It amazes me that although western animation has been commercially successful for so much longer, the greatest imaginative leap the directors seem to able to make is talking animals. Brilliant. The Studio Ghibli films, however, are not afraid to make films where almost all of the characters are people (Kiki's Delivery Service) because they are not afraid to take on live-action films on their own territory - they don't feel the need to retreat to the safety of talking animals, where live-action will not usually follow. But the thing about Studio Ghibli films is that they have people and fantastical creatures in the same film, and what's more, interacting with one another.But I'm speaking too generally. Mononoke is for me the best of the best - see as many Studio Ghibli films as possible, but I think this one is the most brilliant. Personally I prefer the Japanese versions of Studio Ghibli films with the subtitles which match the Japanese script, because the American cast are pretty poor. It is definitely the most beautiful film I have ever seen, fantastically well drawn, but it doesn't hide behind a pretty facade. The story is cracking, great action scenes mixed with truly poignant ones, and the overall environmentalist theme of the story gets more and more relevant with every 8-mile-to-the-gallon American SUV sold.In a word: stunning. In two words: see it.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","avik-basu1889","23 May 2015","Hayao Miyazaki is a legendary name in the genre of anime film- making. What sets his films apart from the rest is the fact that although his films may be animated which is generally considered to be a cinematic medium directed towards kids, but he makes his films profound enough for adults to enjoy too. The kids will find the vibrancy of the visuals enjoyable while the adults will get enough thematic and allegorical depth. Princess Mononoke is no different.Miyazaki deals with the age-old relationship between human beings and nature. The movie I believe is set in Japanese Civil War era. Miyazaki beautifully uses the fantasy-like storyline to promote the messages of tolerance, coexistence and unity and the denouncement of hatred. Man and nature have the right to exist together without any harm coming to either. The script does get a bit too preachy at times, but the visual subtlety and beauty of the film overwhelms the minor issues with the script. The film could have been a little shorter. The film ends beautifully with optimism and with a hope for a new beginning. I had minor reservations with the script, but nevertheless the mastery of Miyazaki's film-making is visible throughout the film and Princess Mononoke is must watch for everyone irrespective of your feelings towards the genre of anime.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","J5iftY5iveXtreme","17 August 2005","From acclaimed animator Hayao Miyazaki (""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" ""Castle in the Sky,"" ""Porco Rosso,"" 2002's ""Spirited Away,"" the recent ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" etc., etc.) comes one of the late 90's most acclaimed films - ""Mononoke hime"" (better known by its English title, ""Princess Mononoke""). Taking place in Japan somewhere in the late medieval times to the early Renaissance in Europe (you can tell its time period since you see guns), this animated epic tells the tale of Ashi-taka, the young prince of a lost Emishi Tribe.The tale begins when Ashi-taka slays a boar demon and saves his village from that monster. But in slaying the beast, he gets cursed, and a wound appears on his right arm. In search for a cure, he journeys, with his ""red elk"" Yarraku, out from his village, never to return.He eventually comes upon Irontown, led by the feisty Lady Eboshi. He is welcomed in that town, and meets several people including Gozo, Eboshi's brute henchman, Toki, a feisty woman worker (like all the women in town, formerly a prostitute until Eboshi bought her freedom), and Toki's husband whom Ashitaka saved, Kohroku. It is in Irontown that Ashitaka learns that Eboshi was was the one who accidentally caused the boar demon to attack his village, since she shot the former animal god and caused it to become angry.Irontown is a modern town and its inhabitants produce rifles, cannons, and other modern weapons introduced to Japan by Westerners. Irontown, a symbol of machinery and metal, sits near an old forest inhabited by spirits and animal spirits, who constantly wage war against Irontown, whose citizens are constantly destroying the forest. It is in this forest that Ashitaka meets San, or, as the rest of Irontown calls her, Princess Mononoke. San was abandoned in the forest and raised by wolves, under the guidance of Moro, the wolf spirit of the forest. San hates human beings (even though she is one), and is determined, under the point of death, to protect the forest from human beings, who are constantly destroying it in an attempt to modernize Japan.San and her fellow nature-loving animals are at war with humanity. Amidst a series of events and many characters, lovable and loathsome, Ashitaka develops a close friendship with San and attempts to bring peace between man and nature.""Mononoke hime"" is a very complex film. Its script, handwritten by Miyazaki using his storytelling talent, is filled with many issues, mostly concerning the role of man in protecting and defiling nature. Although ""Mononoke"" may seem like a simple environmentalist film, its issues are actually deeper than that. The cast of characters is great, filled with lovable (and loathsome) people, all of which are three-dimensional. It's great that Miyazaki chooses to make his characters complex. There are no true good or bad guys in this story. Even the ""bad guys"" are have redeeming qualities. Eboshi, the leading antagonist of this tale, is actually a caring person and houses detested lepers, even giving them a life in Irontown.""Mononoke"" is a very fine film. The animation is gorgeous and beautiful to look at. While in the West, animators are resorting to CGI (i.e. Pixar films, and I love Pixar), Japan retains a traditional method of hand-drawn animation, and thank God for Miyazaki's genius! The score, too, is excellent, and the composer, Joe Hisaishi, is a genius. Combine the score with breath-taking cinematography, gorgeous hand-drawn figures, stylized action scenes, and a powerful story complete with memorable characters, ""Mononoke hime"" is a treat for every movie-goer. This is a mature film in terms of story and content. It even has a few (non graphic) be-headings and dismemberment's, earning it its PG-13 rating in the US.Originally released in Japan, this film featured Yôji Matsuda as the Ashitaka and Yuriko Ishida as the title character (Mononoke/San). It was translated into English, featuring the voices of Billy Crudup as Ashitaka, Claire Danes as San, Minnie Driver (in one of her few notable voice performances alongside Disney's ""Tarzan"") as Eboshi, Gillian Anderson (X-Files) as Moro, Billy Bob Thorton as greedy monk Jigo, and a large cast of English-speaking actors. This English version, alongside the Jap version, was a success. It remains today as one of the best animated features.Miyazaki, we salute you!134 minutes Rated PG-13 for images for violence and gore","

He is banished from his village and is told he will die,but might have a chance if he can find the spirit of the forest.On his journey he meets different people who all seem to have one track minds and he seems to be the only voice of reason in the whole film.He also meets a girl who can talk to animals and seems to be bloodthirsty for humans even though she's a human herself. That's maybe because she was raised by wolves,and that humans especially one B*tch in particular has been destroying the forest and animals just so she can make iron.Anyway this movie will definitely p*ss you off,and if that was it's intent it succeeded.Oh,but the ending SUCKED. I mean really could it have been any cheesier? Visuals: Looking at the visuals from a 2006 perspective they weren't all that great. Better than old Disney cartoon visuals,but definitely not better than anything that has been put out since we entered the new millennium.Characters: You will feel for the characters especially the main character.I quite liked him, and hated others. On a superficial note he has a sexy voice too.LoL! Bottomline: This movie is rather drama orientated,and really violent in some scenes. If you like those sort of things you'll fully like this movie. I have hated so far all this man's movies with the exception of Howl's Moving Castle.So for this movie to get a 5(Neutral) from me is saying something.Basically see this movie if you love drama.

I tried to change the channel but the remote controller was too far away from me so I decided to keep watching the film. It was Mononoke Hime.I leave in the bask country in Spain, where we have a terrorist problem (it looks like it is solved now), and I am tired of films in which when someone believes something, he/she must fight till death for that belief. This film says the opposite. When one believes something, one must GIVE in order to get the best solution to a conflict. This way of approaching a problem, cannot be better displayed than Ashitaka in the film. Wonderful. I've seen the film in Spanish so perhaps then sentence is different, but the one saying ""I've come to understand without being influenced by hate"" could be very profitable for human kind. After the film I watched all Miyazakies, and I must say that the only one that is almost as good as this one is Naussica. Regards","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","honeybounif","3 January 2024","When I was young, this film was more of a beautiful spectacle of animation rather than a interesting plot. The art to this film is beyond any doubt one of the best in animation history. This alone could make me rate this a 10/10 film, many could argue movies like your name or suzume could surpass the art. Hayoa miyazi prides himself in hand drawn animation, as seen in most of his films, and this to me brings this movie up a lot.Beauty of art aside, the plot to this film is insane. Though the only negative I would have is how slow the beginning is, putting a lot of people off. A plot where the character is neither in the ""good"" or ""bad"" and rather helps everyone and is then seen of a bad guy from both sides. The good and bad side is completely the choice of the viewer (though most would be on princess mononokes side).The antagonist to this film is arguably the most ambiguous character in the film. Is she really evil for the pain she has put on the land, or is she a good person for the service and valour she has given to her own kind?Hayao miyazi also produces well thought out, powerful female characters with faults and development that many films these days lack.There is so much to unpack in this film its ridiculous.I would generally call this film one of the best. And I recommend it 100%","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Bob Pr.","8 October 2000","(AKA English) ""Princess Mononoke""I'd read good reviews of this and long wanted to see it so got it when my local video shop had it. I found it worth seeing but a little uneven.Much of the artwork, especially of landscapes and atmosphere and weather, is stunning. Some of the artwork, to my taste, is too crude (e.g., as in the drawings of the wolf mother and sibs to Mononoke).Perhaps those growing up in Japanese culture absorb a supporting fabric that makes the story line more natural and understandable to them than to an American audience. I'm appreciative of the idea that it does not have to be Man vs. Nature (as some industrialists view it) -- that there can be a co-existence or maybe even a symbiosis? The storyline presented realistic conflict among the forces on both sides (nature & animal vs. man) but while the motives of the conflicts on the nature/animal side were understandable, those on the human side were far less so.*** WARNING -- SOME WILL FIND THE FOLLOWING SPOILS THE OUTCOME ***Generally, I often find story lines with supernatural forces are interesting, especially when they deal with moral issues as this does. I can accept that folklore has gods with different levels of power. But it did bother me that the supergod of all Nature, capable walking on water and special powers of healing, of transforming shape from day to night, of spreading out an ooze over the whole land that would injure humans, of living and functioning without a head -- that a god with such powers has a head that can be chopped off by humans and can not find it if humans keep it in a box.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","slowcando","17 June 2023","My first Ghibli. However I've seen a few japanese animes and have marvelled at their imagination. With the animated medium the imagination is the limit and Princess Mononoke is filled with unique (for westerners) ideas and plenty of memorable striking visuals: images like San's bloody mouth, the possessed bull, the face of the Deer God, the giant Night Walker roaming the forests, the harmless spirit creatures with lopsided heads, and many more.A feast for the eyes!The story is also pretty good: while at its core we get a standard tale of men-vs-environment (like Watership Down two decades prior to this) the way it's told is engaging and original. The characters are drawn & played so well that they're nicely individually identifiable (not always a given with japanese fiction). The ending is very fantasy with clear metaphors: a fine way to end even if a little cliché, as 'environmental' fantasy films go. There was room for more surprising or original ways to end the story but it didn't go there. Not really a complaint, just an observation.Note: i watched in original japanese with the 'literal translation' as subtitles which were ideal: short and to-the-point. I tried the english-dialogue first as subtitles but it was too wordy, and then as audio-dub but most of the actors sounded detached from the work (Keith David excepted). The japanese-audio is superior: the voices blend in nicely, and Moro (the 'mother' wolf) being voiced by an elderly male adds to the otherworldy factor which is missing when she's voiced by a bored Gillian Anderson.As my first Ghibli is a strong 8/10, I'll be watching another one soon!","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","harrylosborne","12 March 2020","Studio Ghibli almost exclusively produce great films, but Mononoke is more than just colours and smooth animation: it is a complex story of man's attempts to harness nature, and how it shouldn't be a conflict, but instead should be a symbiotic relationship. Using 14th century Japan as the vehicle for this story is perfect - as the nation undergoes an industrial evolution, the forest tries to fight back, and only Ashitaka (the main character) seems to see the full picture.For something animated as far back at 1997, Princess Mononoke looks immaculate. The quality of animation is second to none, and the creativity that went into the aesthetic and the environment is amazing. The accompanying soundtrack is very good: subtle enough not to override the delicacy of some scenes, but still lends sufficient power to more dramatic moments. There is also an abundance of decent voice actors too - Billy Crudup, Minnie Driver, John DiMaggio and many others lend their talents to this film, which makes the voice-dubbed version a painless experience.The story is both fantasy and action, a love story and a war film; so many elements combine for this plot, and the film is all the better for it. Loosely, the story follows a prince trying to find the cure for a curse inflicted upon him by a demon, but there is a lot more to it; the relationship between Ashitaka and Mononoke herself is one of both love and hate, since they both care too much for humans and the forest respectively to let one destroy the other.Words don't really do justice to just how good Princess Mononoke is. I know some people won't really understand just why I think this is such a masterpiece of cinema, but there is both nostalgia and emotional power to this film. I know for those that do connect with Mononoke, they will never forget this feature.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","krational66","14 April 2020","Good film, there are many layers, more and more people like, can not stop.
See environmental protection, only the outermost layer, this film is so good that more than a lot of people imagine, its level is very deep.
In the film, the core characters and their meaning, roughly speaking, the nature represented by mono no ke, the human society represented by the city woman (black hat), and the bystander or thinker represented by the bird (axidaka). In addition, there is the animal kingdom of the radical boar god, the human society of such organizations and so on.
The hero is a near-perfect character, kind and brave (he risked his life to save his family), strong and calm (he ran back and forth between forces at the last minute), big-hearted and big-hearted (the one in dadara). But only in this way can the tragic feelings be reflected. He said to sang, ""we have done our best,"" and held her in his arms, accepting the unknown ending, living or dying, all came like a verdict in that brilliant light. Yes, even if we open our hearts, sympathize with each other, and try our best, we will not be able to balance the conflicts in this world, because it is no longer the so-called desire and contradiction, but the most basic helplessness of life in this world -- heaven and earth are not benevolence, and all things are the dog.
The favorite character is actually the female Lord who represents human reason and desire. In fact, she is by no means avarice or a surrogate for industrial civilization. The film is definitely not an indictment of industrial civilization. She was not cutting mountains and trees for her own greed, but for something very basic: survival. Happiness or pain, even like a ghost in the sickbed to breathe, but also want to live, and live with a little more dignity. On this woman, reflected a lot of human noble character, not pleased by external gains, not saddened by personal losses, there is no romance of the moan, only resolute, indomitable adhere to. There is no wrong, people alive, is the acquisition of nature. As the population grows, human needs become a bottomless pit that cannot be filled, but that is no reason for the uncaring to die without a sound. If being alive means having power, then she's determined to do it. In the end, she did not collapse like the post-modern people in the face of the tragic outcome, but calmly ""start from scratch"". There is no wrong, people, like those weeds, also have tenacious vitality.
Sang, the strength of the portrayal, in fact, not as profound as the former two. But because she is behind, have white Wolf, wild boar, unicorn god and so on, so the strength of this aspect is also very strong. The difference between a Wolf and a wild boar is also intriguing. Just as humans have many different attitudes towards nature, so does the other side of the mirror. Impressive such as the dialogue between the white Wolf and the bird, accompanied by the bleak and distant music (long stone! , such a simple scene, actually absentminded between like an epic feeling.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","JaydoDre","21 December 2013","Princes Mononoke is one of Hayao Miyazaki's high profile creations relatively well known in the West, which is not surprising considering its reserved adult tone and the down-to-earth ecological themes that should resonate with the Western audiences. Still, it is a complex epic with a high artistic level and it has a knack for holding the viewer's attention from start till finish.The film tells a story of a conflict between the forest Gods and humans into which the human protagonist is pulled as he comes searching for a cure for his worsening affliction. Although, it has a hippie tint to it, the story is not forcing any opinions and the characters are realistic with appealing personalities.The Japanese acting and its English dubbing are both notable. The makers tried to ensure a high quality conversion into English and even the songs are beautifully sung in English by Sasha Lazard. The English acting however isstrange. A lot of it is bizarrely devoid of emotion, far more than the original material, which is already relatively tame by Japanese animation standards. This is especially true for the main hero's dialogue.This detached English performance keeps coming back throughout the film in various characters and therefore seems to be intentional but it does not appear to be in key with the tone of the movie and, at some points, sounds out of sync with the emotions being portrayed by the characters' faces. As mentioned, the Japanese performance can also be very calm at times, but that calmness serves a purpose to underline someone's character or a particular situation and feels appropriate. The English monotony often does not.With some of the characters the English dub does feel weightier, most notably with the animals, but despite the efforts of such notables as Gillian Anderson the Japanese version still feels far superior.The personalities are all interesting, but the main character is a little unreal. He is a young person who is introduced to a new environment, but whenever it suits the movie, he somehow knows what is going on and what to do, with copious amounts of confidence and better than the characters who have been living at the location for a long time. It feels like the animators cut a few corners with his character not to make the already long movie even longer.The animation is awesome. Myazako is really all about that word, ""animation"". Everything feels alive. This life comes from a high attention to detail. Small and sometimes subtle movements breathe life into the side characters, some of whom will only occupy the screen for a few seconds , but they pass that life on to the rest of the film. These little imaginative details keep the viewer interested and drawn in.The high budget for the film shows in these details and in the fluidity of the animation. There are noticeably many frames of animation, not all the time but there where it matters. The visual transitions are also great, like the change from dry to rainy weather or from living to dead plants. These are made especially effective by sparing use of colour. Bright saturated colour in this film appears to be used primarily for contrast to indicate life or magic.The orchestral soundtrack complements the mood well most of the time, with an occasional recurrence of minimalistic taiko drums for extra contrast. I did notice a few scenes where the mellow music did not fit in with the action, but I know this is more to do with the Japanese cultural outlook on such type of action scenes.What is really good with both the music and other sound effects is that they are used sparingly and stop when appropriate. The lack of sound is used very effectively.If there is one point of contention it is the ending. It feels rushed. Once the movie comes to its conclusion you might realise that the motivations of different characters have not been fully explained. Considering how major the decisions they make are, it would really help to explain things in more detail. The last few events in the film and their consequences are also unclear. At this point the dialogue starts going off the track as well. One of the characters who failed at what he tried to achieve just happily accepts the outcome. The main hero starts uttering empty pretentiousness. Yet another character is just forgotten. Most of the issues the characters had do not get resolved. No lessons learned. The last few minutes of the film just feel mangled up and cut short.I feel the memory of this film in the fans may be a tad rose-coloured, but apart from a few story issues, Princess Mononoke is one of the greatest things you can see on the screen. The interesting details and good contrast in sound and visuals keep the viewer engaged. I want to say this film is what Ferngully should have been, but I feel like I am insulting Princess Mononoke by putting those two in the same sentence.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","lumpynose","23 October 2002","After all of the raving I heard about this I was expecting a lot more. The characters weren't interesting and none of them made me care about them. The character development was weak.It seems to me that drama is hard to do with animation because they can't do as much with the facial expressions.  Perhaps it's too difficult to be subtle with animation (or anime).The story was only mildly interesting.  It didn't have any epic qualities about it.  The animation may have been great but these days with computers helping them it's hard to be impressed by mere glitz.The scene near the end with the forest spirit turning into a headless monster gave me the feeling I was watching an animated variation on the Godzilla theme.Very run-of-the-mill overall I'd say.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","sudhakaranakhilan","29 April 2020","For the persons, not about the kids loving animation, Princess Mononoke will be a better treat for them. The era now ongoing flourished with a lot of 3D colorful and lively animated works, Princess Mononoke went back us to the late decades of 2D animation. We are all familiar with Disney as the king of animation and along with Dreamworks, Pixar, etc but this is from the 'manga' place that is called Japan. The place, setting, and the subject set back us the historical background of Japan. The movie points out the question regarding humans and nature. We are confused about the above question because we don't know what should consider important in the context. Whether we have to fix human above nature or vice-versa. The film smoothly approaches to that question and finds a mid to mid answer through the characterization of Ashitaka. Ashitaka stood along with both nature and humans. It's about the human greed for nature for the development of their society and culture at the same time the animals thriving to set their place. So, Princess Mononoke is for all kinds of film lovers who don't consider animation works as mere a simple kid watching process rather than an important film genre.","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","neondomination2000","13 January 2006","I'm a kid of 14 years old and i watched this movie at 2004. i was really touched by the screen play the dialogue and every thing about it. i couldn't have been touched if the music wasn't so brilliant. i was so touched by the music i bought the soundtrack and kept listening till it made me cry (i don't why). The characters are great the prince and the princess. Shows me a lot what i can do when I'm older, movie is very touching and also very 'breathtaking'. If anything i recommend this movie. if you are my age you will love it go on and try this movie out. adults same thing goes to you P>S i think this the best animated movie made nothing can change that","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","natmavila","13 August 2023","What a wild ride through the mystical forest of awesomeness! ""Princess Mononoke"" is like the ultimate nature vs. Industry showdown, with a side of talking animals and a dash of epic sword fights. I mean, forget lumberjacks, the real deforestation warriors here are giant boars with serious anger management issues. And let's not even get started on those wolf buddies who make me question my choice of spirit animals.The animation is so breathtaking that even my popcorn got choked up! It's like Studio Ghibli sprinkled magical pixie dust on every frame. The characters are more complex than a Rubik's cube in a tornado - from Ashitaka, the one-armed eco-hero, to San, the forest ninja with an allergy to shirts. And don't get me started on Lady Eboshi - she's the ultimate ""villain you kind of secretly root for."" With all the action, drama, and a side of forest spirits, ""Princess Mononoke"" is the kind of movie that makes me want to grab a bow, ride a giant wolf, and declare war on deforestation... or at least plant a tree in my backyard. 🌳So, whether you're an environmental enthusiast, a fantasy fanatic, or just someone who's into arm-wrestling with forest gods, ""Princess Mononoke"" will surely take you on a journey more epic than a squirrel's quest for the last acorn. It's a must-watch for anyone who's ever looked at a tree and thought, ""You know what? This definitely needs more wolves."" Five stars for the movie, minus half a star because there weren't enough singing mushrooms. 🍄🌟","

"PRINCESS MONONOKE","Motion-Picture-Watchmen","13 April 2022","Despite the title misleading the audience on the true protagonist of the story and sporadic Misandrist comments, this movie has a lot to offer.I particularly liked the protagonist, for his straightforward humility and respect for human life. His neutral stance on the conflict is not a sign of indifference and apathy, but of general discontent against killing and hate. This is only one sign of the complex storytelling. In fact, an additional layer of greatness and mature storytelling comes from the moral ambiguity, i.e. That the various characters and groups have believable, divergent motivations.The animation is marvelous as always, the colorful paintings being awe-inspiring. I would even go as far as to call it sublime. The visually weird Nightwalker at the end was quite off-putting, though.The movie is evidently allegorical in nature, underlying the fragile relationship between men and nature, the dilemma between development and preservation. This, in a time when our societies have become more eco-conscious, is highly appreciated.Furthermore, action ranges from simply thrilling to utterly epic, and its consequential nature gives it more depth. The violence was quite startling at times, though. The piano-heavy score is also solid.In conclusion, this film constitutes an impressive piece of filmmaking thanks to splendid animation and an immersive, captivating and riveting story.","
