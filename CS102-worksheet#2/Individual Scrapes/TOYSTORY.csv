"TOY STORY","bob the moo","22 April 2003","Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence.Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula.The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz's turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads.Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It's hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.  The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors. Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz. Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults.Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things!","

"TOY STORY","ccthemovieman-1","18 February 2007","This is a very clever animated story that was a big hit, and justifiably so. It had a terrific sequel and if a third film came out, that would probably be a hit, too.When this came out, computer technology just was beginning to strut its stuff. Man, this looked awesome. Now, it's routine because animation, which took a giant leap with this movie, has made a lot more giant strides.The humor in here, however, is what made this so popular. There are tons of funny lines, issued by characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and John Ratzenberger, among others. As good as Hanks is as ""Woody"" and Allen as ""Buzz Armstrong,"" I think the supporting characters just about stole the show: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc.Multiple viewings don't diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too. This is a guaranteed ""winner"" as is the sequel.","

"TOY STORY","philip_vanderveken","25 December 2004","I am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the Pixar Studios. They are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies, creating movies that are more than just worth a watch, even when they were made a decade ago.The movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. When the young boy's birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don't want to be ignored when the new one arrives. Woody the cowboy is their ""leader"" because he's the most popular one of them all. He's the only one that hasn't got to be afraid, but than a new favorite arrives ... Buzz Lightyear. He hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him, but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other...When you see Toy Story, you may think that the different human like characters (Woody the cowboy for instance) aren't always as perfect as we are used to see in todays animated movies. Perhaps that's true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren't yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. I give it an 8.5/10.","

"TOY STORY","MovieAddict2016","21 February 2003","Toy Story – 5/5 starsChildren play with toys. It is a known fact. At one time or another, we all played with toys, whether they were action figures, dolls, little green soldiers, etc But what if toys were real? What if they could talk?Pixar and Disney serve us this theory in what was the first full-length computer-animated film ever, 'Toy Story,' chronicling the events in the life of a cowboy doll, Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks).Woody is the favorite toy of his owner, a small child named Andy. Andy brings Woody everywhere, and cherishes him, as we see in the beginning of the film. However, this all changes on Andy's birthday when Andy gets a new toy: a Buzz Lightyear doll (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody is suddenly forgotten, left with the rest of his friends: Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney, better known as Ernest) and Ham (see if you can guess the voice of this one? I'll give you a hint: 'Cheers'). But after Buzz accidentally gets knocked out an upstairs window, Woody is the prime suspect. Now, after Woody and Buzz end up next door, in toy killer Sid's house, Woody must prove his innocence by getting both Buzz and him back to Andy's house safely.'Toy Story' builds on an element we all shrug off carelessly and thoughtlessly. Much like they did last year with monsters under the bed, Pixar took the theory of live toys to a new level in 'Toy Story,' filling our minds with endless possibilities.What Pixar does is a strange thing. It doesn't just try to expand our mind, but also out world. I respect and enjoy that. In 'Monsters, Inc.,' Pixar managed to preach to us 'What if monsters under the bed are real, and what if they have a world much like ours, and have feelings like humans,' while never forgetting the equally important formula of humor. Much is the same with their earlier film 'Toy Story.' What if those wooden and plastic toys we all played with as kids are real? What if they have feelings, emotions, voices, and human qualities? An interesting idea by itself, but when mixed with a wicked sense of humor and reality, you've got yourself one of the best films ever.Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody. Pixar must have modeled the doll's expressions and movements after Hanks, because after a while, I feel like I AM watching Hanks on screen, and NOT a computer-generated image. When you get to the point of not being able to tell animation from reality, you know that the voices are good.The same goes for Tim Allen, though the body gestures were most likely not modeled after Allen's physical expressions (Buzz is a short, pot-bellied toy).The rest of the cast is excellent, all very believable and entertaining. You begin to love each character for their distinguishing traits, and that is always refreshing.I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films. The only film they made that I named forgettable was 'A Bug's Life,' which was in and of it not horrible, but lacking the sense of humor the other Pixar films have and had.Pixar makes very refreshing films. In an era of cheap, made-for-video Disney sequels, rip-off cartoons and television babysitters (i.e. 'The Jungle Book 2), Pixar holds true to the values that made Disney films so entertaining back in the 30's-60's: Respect for the audience's intelligence, humor, provocative ideas to base the film upon, and respect for the audience (not the exact same thing as the first element), all of which are forgotten in this day and age of money-makers. I respect Pixar very much, and after hearing how little Disney does in helping with their films, I feel that Disney is just trying to cash in on their ideas by having their name branded on the posters for Pixar films. Shame on you, Disney. Proof that Disney has no respect for audiences is the fact that they will not let another sequel be made – something that fans like me would rather have than something like 'Finding Nemo.''Toy Story' 1 & 2 are both on my 'favorite films' list. It may sound stupid, but if I made up a top 250 list like IMDb.com, both of those films would be on there; so would 'Monsters Inc.' After an unpromising trailer for Pixar's upcoming film 'Finding Nemo,' I think that after their licensing deal with Disney is disputed (they have to cough up five more ORIGINAL films – not sequels – by 2005), they should definitely try to make a 'Toy Story 3.' I'll be first in line for it, anyway.","

"TOY STORY","Quinoa1984","13 February 2000","Toy Story is a sheer delight to view on the screen.  The characters are well done, the plot is exceptional, and the best thing of all, the film is entirely produced on the computer.  The animation is extraordinary in it's ability to bring such great entertainment to the screen.  The film also teaches some good lessons for the kids like friendship (mainly between Woody and Buzz Light-year).  Spectacular entertainment all around and one of the best films Disney has come with.","

"TOY STORY","tieman64","17 November 2009","""I believe that a filmmaker's entire work is contained within his first film; not that it can all be foreseen, but that it can afterwards be verified."" – Francois Truffaut (The Films In My Life) Buzz Lightyear, a glossy action figure with a sexy sheen, is not a mere toy. He's a Space Ranger, tasked with protecting the universe from the evil Emperor Zurg! His life has meaning, he is unique, his existence has grand purpose! Woody, a dated cowboy doll, thinks otherwise. He was once a youthful and exuberant toy, the favourite plaything of his owner Andy, but years of existence have shown him the truth: everyone is just a toy, soon to be forgotten and discarded. No one is unique. There is no grand purpose. No universe to save. Better to be a realist, seeing the world without its fake plastic facade and tacky ipod veneer.Of course Buzz thinks Woody is just a crazy old timer. Doesn't Woody realise that Buzz is a genuine Space Ranger?! That he's a member of the Elite Universe Protection Unit! That he alone has information that reveals Emperor Zurg's weakness! That stupid fool! Naturally, we the audience identify with Woody. Buzz seems like an idiot, brainwashed and in desperate need of identity and purpose. The Elite Universe Protection Unit merely elevates believers into a position of exaggerated importance. This is an idle fantasy, an other-worldly hope adopted by those who can't face the dour reality that is the ""real world of toys"".Midway in the film, our heroes stumble across a horde of green alien toys. These aliens worship a giant claw, a mechanical God which they believe will descend and pluck the ""chosen ones"", taking them to some kind of toy heaven. In reality, the claw chooses only deluded souls, and offers them to the devilish Cid Phillips, a sadistic child who mutilates toys. ""Nirvana is coming!"" the aliens whisper, watching as the ""chosen ones"" are airlifted to their deaths.Buzz Lightyear faces a similar scenario later in the film. Having witnessed a television commercial which advertises a vast range of Buzz Lightyear action figures, Buzz must confront the fact that he really is ""just an ordinary toy"" who ""can not fly"". ""Flying"" thus becomes a sort of Nietzschean metaphor, the ability to transcend the ""flesh"" (in this case, injection moulded plastic) and become ""something more"".Buzz's first reaction upon seeing the commercial is to seek refuge in denial. ""I am not a toy!"" he says to himself, before climbing to the top of a staircase. Seeking to validate himself by flying, by defying the laws of toy-dom, he takes a giant jump – a literal leap of faith – and of course falls promptly to the ground. He can't fly.Cue the fastest existential crisis ever seen in a children's film, Buzz Lightyear promptly falling into a deep depression, his faith completely destroyed. His entire existence was based on a lie, a social framework which indoctrinated him into believing that the fate of the whole universe depended on his actions. How can he continue living? Why do anything? What's the point? And more importantly, how the hell did this become a kid's franchise? It's like a demented cartoon by Philip K. Dick (""Do Plastic Toys Dream of Suicide Switches?"").Then comes the message of the film. Woody tells Buzz that being a Space Ranger doesn't define who he is. His value, status and worth can only be found within the community of toys, on ground level, and not ""up in the skies"". There is no purpose beyond ground zero and our importance lies solely in our ability to bring good to those immediately around us.Buzz heeds Woody's words and quickly gets over his loss of faith. He stages a daring rescue mission, straps a rocket to his back and flies spectacularly in the air, his newfound love for the ""greater good of his family"" quite literally giving him wings.In true Zarathustran fashion, Buzz becomes a pint sized Ubermensch figure, a superman who reaches for the sky but is then brought depressingly back down to Earth. If he would just lower his sights, Woody then says, Buzz would find enough reasons to live. Set free of the ""moral code"" imprinted on him by his makers, Buzz thus adopts a new code which, though it puts limits upon him, negating some of his wild ambitions and reducing him, in an existential sense, to a chunk of plastic, still allows for a Nietzschean war cry. This cry, which Buzz yells every time he jumps across that dark abyss, sums up humanity best: ""To Infinity and Beyond!"" 8.9/10 – With its revolutionary visuals, consistent humour, genuine sense of adventure, memorable characters, slick camera work and a couple action/adventure scenes worthy of George Lucas, ""Toy Story"" is a milestone in cinema, and one of the most influential animated films since ""Snow White"".Most interesting, though, is in observing how Brad Bird reverses Lasseter's themes here with his first Pixar feature, ""The Incredibles"". Brad Bird seems to be the bad boy of Pixar, subverting them from within. Viva la Resistance. Worth multiple viewings.","

"TOY STORY","GeorgeRoots","15 December 2013","With the wonderful collaboration of Pixar and Disney, who as of 2013 have given us some of the most visually impressive and wonderful movies ever made. ""Toy Story"" was the go to film of many childhoods (Including my own), and brought CGI movies into the mainstream with stunning promises & confidence.How things came to be, Lucasfilm sold a portion of their effects company to computer giant Apple (That inevitably became Pixar), who would go on to strike a deal with Disney. Director John Lasseter had lost his job to Disney for pitching the idea of this story, and after the successful development stage he managed to gain back the confidence of Disney, and alas the rest is history.I bring this story up just to reflect how far we've matured in terms of story telling & technology. The idea of adults giving kids morals & entertainment through animation, wonderfully echoes that of what Walt Disney set out to do so many decades ago. Toy Story has aged extraordinarily well for the first CGI film ever made. Held together mostly for its impeccable casting, I feel ashamed now 20+ years old and much more experienced in movies to say I still look at Tom Hanks & Tim Allen, and almost immediately think ""Toy Story"". As well as the stellar supporting cast, its visuals are fantastic and the music is timeless. Writers include a young Joss Whedon, and with a rotten antagonist by the name of Sid, makes this movie just as entertaining now as it was then.Final Verdict: It's hard to find any flaw with such a beloved movie, especially the one now most adults will first show their kids. It has everything to move and touch you deeply, and to believe a bunch of 0's and 1's flying around in digital space can do that, ""Toy Story"" is that proof. 10/10.","

"TOY STORY","dunmore_ego","26 May 2006","Y'know, I always suspected that my toys were coming to life when I wasn't looking! In Andy's Room, his toys lead lives of noisy desperation come every birthday and Christmas - no one wants to be one-upped by a new addition to the toy box. Nominally led by Cowboy Woody (there's a Brokeback joke in there just waiting to happen), Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Ham the piggybank, Bo Peep, Slinky the dog and a smattering of other playthings go about their toy business of playing checkers, hanging with the hometoys and ""plastic corrosion awareness meetings,"" until Andy's birthday party, when they gather expectantly around a transistor radio, listening to the reports of their toy soldier troops ""in the field"" (downstairs watching Andy's gift-opening), hoping that no gift will be exciting enough to cause Andy to neglect *them.* There is. His name is Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger.Directed by Pixar mainstay John Lasseter, with the voice talents of Tom Hanks (as Woody), Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger (forever Cliff from *Cheers*), R. Lee Ermey, Annie Potts, Jim Varney and Tim Allen (as Buzz), *Toy Story* is that *rara avis* that succeeds on all levels  in its animation, storyline, character development, its messages of friendship and self-realization and, most importantly, its entertainment value. The fact that this is a cartoon (or animated feature  just what DO we call this new wave of computer-generated movies?) is incidental. Which makes the slightly dodgy animation (of the ""real people"") irrelevant - it gets the point across with or without the technological finesse.The ""Disney Movie"" has become synonymous with maudlin messages, redneck fundamentalism, anachronistic family values, boneheaded parents, smart-mouthing youngsters, too-hip-to-be-smart teens and insufferable pets. Though Disney's tyrannical umbrella overarches this film's production studio, Pixar Animation, *Toy Story* somehow avoided all trace of Disney's craven hand, which is doubly surprising, considering this is Pixar's first feature length film, after years of experimentation. Right outa the gate and right outa the field.Sure, there are ""messages,"" but they are heartfelt, rather than maudlin (Woody tells Buzz during Buzz's greatest depression that it matters not what Buzz thinks of himself, what makes him important is what his owner, Andy, thinks of him); there are emotional segments, which are truly heartbreaking, rather than cheesy (when Buzz's escape attempt lands him with a broken arm, proving he is Not A Flying Toy, the lyric, ""Clearly I will go sailing no more,"" launches a thousand hankies); and the portrayal of Andy's family was Pixar's triumphal achievement. Boldly contravening Disney's *idée fixe* of the 1950's nuclear family and Norman Rockwell fantasies, one of the many incarnations of a modern-day family is presented: a single mother with two kids, who are neither geniuses nor monsters, just normal children; happy to visit Pizza Planet and disappointed when favorite toys are lost.Buzz  who believes he is a real life space ranger on a mission to save the universe - become Andy's favorite toy over Woody. The funny thing is: though Buzz believes he is real, he still adheres to toy protocol of ""playing inert"" when humans are in the area. (Maybe it's instinct?) When he mentions saving a toy from Sid, the vicious boy next door, how does he propose to do it if he is to adhere to the inert protocol? Buzz's ingenuousness regarding his role as a toy infuriates Woody to the point of attempted toy-assassination. Through a concatenation of accidents, both he and Buzz become lost and must use teamwork, trust and ingenuity to beat their path back to Andy, which finds them ensconced in scorchingly funny vignettes (Buzz fastening himself in an over-sized seatbelt; both falling in with green, three-eyed aliens; Buzz hyperventilating as ""Mrs. Nesbitt""). During a climactic rocket ride, the callback line, ""This is not flying - this is falling with style,"" simply seals this movie's greatness.At least I now have a plausible explanation as to why my toys always got lost: after going about their toy business, they would just go inert anywhere they happened to be, instead of paying attention to their master's infallible toy filing system.","

"TOY STORY","Anonymous_Maxine","20 April 2001","Toy Story is not only the best Disney film because it has the best story and the best animation, but also because of the excellent actors chosen to provide the voices of the animals. The casting was perfect from top to bottom, and the movie provides an excellent adventure story about friendship and loyalty that keeps you engrossed until the nail-biting climax.
Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provided excellent voices for Woody and Buzz Lightyear -their performances alone are one of the biggest things that made this such a spectacular movie. Besides that, though, you have the excellent story that is not only noteworthy because it has never really been told from this perspective before, but also because it was just told so well. All of the characters in the film are very well developed and all have appropriate and effective actors chosen to provide their voices. And of course, who could forget the revolutionary animation! The computer animation used for this movie not only made it startlingly realistic but also opened up tons of possibilities, and thankfully the filmmakers chose to explore these possibilities. There are dozens of things that are hidden in the woodwork throughout the film, as well as in the songs  note, for example, the subtle playing of the Indiana Jones theme song in the scene where Woody knocks Buzz out the window with the desk lamp.
Toy Story is by far the best Disney film ever made, it's pretty much perfect. It's adventurous, it's exciting, it's entertaining, it's good for the whole family, it's got great characters, story, and plot, and above all, it's fun.","

"TOY STORY","Hitchcoc","3 January 2015","What a wonderful integration of classic toys and a superb plot. It's a new height in animation (though things have gotten even more impressive long since). The voicings of Tim Allen as Buzz and Tom Hanks as Woody, with their inherent connection to their toy beings, with an incredible supporting cast, make this a romp to end all romps. There is a strain between the realities of the world and the fact that even though they are sentient beings, they are still toys. Buzz has lights that flash but he can't really fly. Woody has the ludicrous string on his back that allows him to deliver his catch phrases. Then there is the neighborhood villain, Sid, who is a maimer and destroyer of toys. There is the quest for the mishandled and lost. And a finale that is worthy of everything that has been set up. What really makes this work is the ""humanity"" of the characters. There is love and a true connection among them. If you have never seen this, it is worth every minute.","

"TOY STORY","SmileysWorld","30 December 2005","Though I am not a big fan of computer animation,I have to give the folks at Pixar credit.This brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.The attention to detail,such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.Computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.Combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.It's obvious that the people at Pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,something rarely seen today.Highly recommended for any home library.","

"TOY STORY","gigan-92","13 December 2010","I remember seeing this film at the ripe age of seven, and I was totally entranced by it. What kid would not have been attracted to that sweet of a premise? Released way back in 1999, it was totally different from the usual hand drawn animation, and yet still as vibrant, if not more so. Even now as an 18 year old dude I find it so amazing. Attention to detail has always been Lasseter's strong suit, among many I might add. But the greatest thing about this film was the life evoked into its unique and untouchable characters.With the voice talents of Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, as well as the hilarious Don Rickles, and the late Jim Varney, the voice acting was perfect and the dialogue was surprisingly intelligent throughout. What could be perceived more or less as a simple story is told with heart and humor, one that hasn't aged a bit since that first viewing. I still own my original VHS copy in fact, but perhaps it's time I buy it on Blu-ray or DVD.","

"TOY STORY","dee.reid","6 September 2005","I'm 19, going on 20 in six days. I don't need to tell you that ""Toy Story"" is a movie tailor-made for the kiddies, but there's a special reservation for adults too. I should know, as should anyone who views it with an open mind. We've all had our favorite toys. For guys, like me, there's a 90% chance you played with either Transformers or G.I. Joe or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or all three when you were six, seven, eight, or nine years-old. For me, it was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Godzilla action figures. I'd always imagine living out wild fantasy adventures in my room or basement; ah, the joy of being a kid again. But that's part of ""Toy Story's"" fun appeal. It gives you a chance to relive your childhood again. Today I saw for the first time in about eight years and it's still just as fresh and inventive as Pixar, probably the best film studio in computer animation, conceived it back in 1995. In the room of young Andy, the toys are alive - when he's not present of course, and cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is the boy's favorite item. But all that changes on Andy's birthday and a new toy given to him on that day captures the boy's heart - Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen). Of course, any replacement of this sort inspires jealousy, and pretty soon Buzz is the new ""it"" item of the bedroom. Andy's given into everything Buzz Lightyear, even new bedsheets - bedsheets! - leaving poor Woody on the short end of the stick. But the thing is, Buzz has trouble believing he's just a simple toy and nothing more, as he thinks he's actually BUZZ LIGHTYEAR! It also seems this couldn't have come at a worse time for the toys, as Andy and his mother are moving away, which is causing all sorts of chaos as Woody tries to get everything organized so nobody is left behind, and that's exactly what happens with rivals Woody and Buzz, who are misplaced and must find their beloved Andy before they move. Not only that, they must also battle Sid, the serial killer in-training kid that lives next door and tortures toys. As directed by John Lasseter and his army of screenwriters including himself, Andrew Stanton (who would co-direct Pixar's future hit ""Finding Nemo"" in 2003) and Joel Cohen, ""Toy Story"" is true imaginative fantasy realized in superb animation. It more than brings the kid in you to the surface, it makes you want to be a kid again, as many toys have cameos including Army Men (including the Sergeant who's voiced by R. Lee Ermey) and Mr. Potato Head (voiced by Don Rickles). I love ""Toy Story,"" and I think anyone who views it thoughtfully will love it too.10/10","

"TOY STORY","ofpsmith","15 January 2015","The first feature length Pixar film and the first feature film to be made entirely in computer animated imagery Toy Story was a milestone in film history. But apart from it's massive impact, Toy Story is still a really great film. The toys in the bedroom of Andy Davis (John Morris) are alive (when Andy doesn't look) and seem to have their own community set up. The most popular toy being Andy's favorite toy, a toy cowboy named Woody (Tom Hanks). But that might change this birthday when Andy get's a new toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) a toy spaceman who still thinks that he's a real spaceman. To add on to that Woody takes an immediate disliking to Buzz because Andy seems to play with him more now and all the other toys go the same route. Well Woody and Buzz inadvertently end up in the house of Sid Phillips (Erik Von Detten) the destructive next door neighbor who is pretty much the type of person that would put a turtle on it's shell for fun. So Woody and Buzz have to overcome their differences and get back to Andy's house before he moves. This film's story is great and intriguing. The comedy here is also great. The dialog between Woody and Buzz is very funny. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. It's the birthplace of Pixar who over the years have proved themselves worthy of the praise given by adults and children alike.","

"TOY STORY","slokes","10 May 2004","Just in case you were also wondering what happened to all the toys that went missing when you were a kid, the answer is clear: They escaped.""Toy Story"" is the kind of children's movie adults can enjoy just as much, because it very cleverly mines deep deposits of nostalgia from the memory banks. That may be the reason the 1990s bedroom of young Andy is populated by playthings of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. If Andy was a real boy of his time, there would be a computer and a TV/Nintendo, and not much else.The voicings of the various toys add to the enjoyability. Tom Hanks was the biggest star of the moment when ""Toy Story"" came out, and he works with that likeability by creating a stable center as Woody the cowboy doll. Don Rickles has the screen role of his career (not that ""Kelly's Heroes"" was Oscar material) as a prickly Mr. Potato Head, while Jim Varney and R. Lee Ermey are standouts in the supporting cast.Tim Allen gives the movie's best performance, as a newfangled toy that takes Woody's place in Andy's heart but can't bring himself to accept that he's just a plastic plaything. It's the role of the story that gives him the best lines (""I don't believe that man has ever been to medical school""), but Allen delivers them with real panache. He more than holds his own, and you kind of see where he took off with that note-perfect William Shatner parody he perfected on screen in the underrated ""Galaxy Quest.""While this movie's use of computer animation makes it a milestone, it neither represents the most innovative use of the technology or the cleverest Pixar-ated treatment of a story. ""A Bug's Life"" seems a more worthy apex; that story was funnier, worked better on its own merits, and used the animation to better effect. But given how novel all of this was in 1995, ""Toy Story"" could have been a lot less thought-through than it was, and still made gobs of money. The fact it is instead invested with real heart, and can be watched and enjoyed today just as easily as when it debuted nearly 10 years ago, is a tribute to the people behind it.I like Randy Newman's music, just not here, and while the animation textures are surprisingly lifelike, there are places, especially with Scud the dog but also with the baby's drool, where it falls short. The story itself gets kind of rote with repeat viewings, though the transition to Sid's bedroom and its sad mutilated toys is a genius moment. So too are the vending machine aliens, who gape in rapt wonder at the judgment of ""the claw."" If it reached for pathos a little less often, ""Toy Story"" would be an undeniable classic.As it is, it is very, very good, the kind of film that's only good for children, even (especially?) the inner ones.","

"TOY STORY","slightlymad22","7 December 2014","Toy Story is one of those rare animated movies, designed for children, that adults can enjoy.Plot In A Paragraph: Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) is 8 year old Andy's favourite toy, however his world falls apart when Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) figure for his birthday and he has to play second fiddle to the new space ranger.I loved this movie. Over the years I have watched it with both my kids and nieces and nephews and they have all enjoyed it. Watching it now, it has lost none of its charm. Tom Hanks is superb as Woody, Tim Allen (who I'm not a fan of) is delightful as the deluded Buzz Lightyear who is not aware he is an action figure, but for me the stand out voice was John Ratzenberger as Pork Chop the Piggy Bank.","

"TOY STORY","alexkolokotronis","3 February 2009","Toy Story is the film that started Pixar Animated Studios into its long string of never ending success. What Pixar does is not just absorb the younger demographic and keep the older ones mildly entertained. It completely absorbs everyone watching no matter the age or the level of maturity, films of Pixar, starting from Toy Story, have kept a certain magical touch around it with an unexpected amount of depth. Everyone as a child imagines their toys will come alive and go on their own adventures. One of the great things Pixar does is that it does not attract audiences with its overloaded superstar casts but rather with its material. The only superstar here is Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is the next most aforementioned voice over. Unlike what most people think their is an actually a method to casting for animated films as there is to a live-action one. As a result of this Pixar stays faithful to its material and creates a great genuine and warm feeling around the film and its characters.","

"TOY STORY","TheLittleSongbird","16 June 2009","Toy Story is just a wonderful film, that I recommend to anyone who loves animation. I will also say that it is definitely the best Pixar movie to date, all of which are extremely good, even the weaker efforts Cars and the Incredibles are well worth watching. I loved the voice talents, the talented Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody, and Tim Allen likewise as Buzz. Both characters are hugely engaging thanks to their frequent conflicts, and are well supported by excellent supporting characters like Potato Head, Rex, Ham and Little Bo Beep, voiced by the likes of Don Rickles, Jim Varney, John Ratzenberger and Annie Potts. Not to mention the hilarious toy aliens, and the creepy kid Sid. The voice talents aren't the only things worth mentioning, the film has a remarkable story and a truly irreverent script (""I'm from Mattel, actually I'm from a smaller company that was purchased by Mattel in a leveraged buyout""). But the best aspect of the movie is the phenomenal animation, which was colourful and sophisticated with brilliant character movement. Honestly, I loved this movie, and I also thought the sequel is one of the few sequels of recent times, that actually manages to surpass its predecessor. All in all, a wonderful film, that is a must-see for the whole family. 10/10 Bethany Cox.","

"TOY STORY","CubsandCulture","28 December 2020","I re-watched this for the first time in about 15 years and it still holds up remarkably well. The animation is still very expressive at capturing character, tone and making a believable world unto itself. Pixar would go on to create more polished films but this one has all the hallmarks of the company. The story is enjoyable for children and if parents squint they can see a metaphor in employment turnover. (Not to mention the cultural transition from westerns to sci-fi, or the meta irony of 2d cell animation being supplanted by CGI). The film is equal parts charming, funny and exciting. It even tugs at the heartstrings not matter how cynical you are. It is far from Pixar's best but it holds its own in the pantheon of animated films.","

"TOY STORY","OllieSuave-007","27 January 2014","Disney and Pixar studios team up and brought us an imaginative adventure story about a little boy named Andy who loves playing with his toys, with his best friend being a cowboy doll named Woody. However, when Andy and not body else is looking, the toys come to life. Woody is the leader of the toys in Andy's room, which include a Mr. Potato Head, Slinky the Dog, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Pig and Bo-Peep the girl doll. However, when Andy's get new toy space ranger Buzz Lightyear for his birthday, Buzz takes the place of Woody of being leader of the toys and Andy's new best friend. Brewing with jealously, Woody attempts to get rid of Buzz, but both ended up lost outside of Andy's house. As a result, they must find their way back to Andy's house before they move - first trying to get through Andy's weird neighbor and toy torturer Sid.This is filmed in brilliant and colorful computer animation - very detailed and realistic. The story is full of surprises and adventure, from Woody and Buzz getting lost in a pizza shop to them trying to break loose out of Sid's house to get back to Andy's. The movie is also filled with comedy; you will have to watch the movie to appreciate and understand the humor only live toys could make. And, there are toe-tapping songs you would learn to love including Randy Newman's opening song ""You've Got a Friend in Me."" While this movie's plot is full of non-stop fun and adventure, making every moment exciting and entertaining, the film also concentrates on friendship and teamwork and overcoming all odds. While I mostly enjoyed this movie, I wished that Woody was not made out to be hated on so much by the other toys after Woody's jealous behavior towards Buzz. I thought this takes away at Woody's hero status too much especially for his first movie.But overall, this is one of Disney's best work, which will make you suspend your disbelief and expand your imagination. Also, hands down to a great voice cast: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Annie Potts and Jim Varney.Grade B+","

Only to start, the story: The toys have life of their own, and every time we humans are distant from them, they have their lives and their own plans. Woody, until Buzz LightYear comes up,was Andy's favorite toy and also the leader of all of them. Jealous of Buzz's fame, Woody tries to get a rid of him, and because of that is totally ignored by the others toys, who once were his friends and admired him.

"TOY STORY","haydenluz","5 January 2021","Toy Story was directed & written by John Lasseter, being his, and Pixar's first major production. Toy Story was originated by John Lasseter himself, Joe Ranft, who wrote The Lion King & Beauty and the Beast, and the start of the iconic Pete Docter & Andrew Stanton as well.Toy Story broke so many barriers, creating the first full-length motion picture about toys, when we're not around, while giving them humanized traits, and problems, (I knew I wasn't the only one who used to think about my toys when I wasn't around, as a kid). It's almost impossible not to praise this film, being one of a few films 100% critically acclaimed on Rotten Tomatoes. Toy Story was an inventive family-film, created twenty-five years ago, and other then some mediocre animations, the film still holds up tremendously til this day! It is beautifully paced, while having high risks at all times.Before I jump into these amazing characters, I want to give credit to Janet Hirshen, Mike Fenton, Jane Jenkins & Ruth Lambert, for casting the absolute best voice over cast, someone could've ever put together. Sheriff Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, was the clear cut leader of the toys. Woody is the smartest of the group, stealing every scene he's in, with tremendous character development. Buzz Lightyear, voiced by Tim Allen, was a super enjoyable character, adding this toy personality, compared to everyone else's humanized personalities. Buzz complimented Woody very well throughout the whole film, creating a decent share of the risks. Rex, voiced by Wallace Shawn, was almost indefinitely the best character in the film. He is by far the funniest of the group, adding an unexpected twist to his personality. Mr. Potato Head, voiced by Don Rickles, acted as the dad character, with such a negative attitude, that clashed brilliantly with everyone. Hamm, voiced by John Ratzenberger, was one of the smartest of the pack, being very blunt, and right to the point. Slinky Dog, voiced by Jim Varney, was Woody's right hand man, being the most matured toy of the group. Our antagonist in Sid, is just as diabolical as the Joker, Thanos, & Scar. He is so dark and creepy, and poses a huge traumatic threat to any toy in the area, or in his possession.The screenplay by Andrew Stanton, Joe Ranft, Bud Luckey, Pete Docter, Joss Whedon, Joel Cohen & Alec Sokolow, was so pleasing for the kids and the adults, sneaking in their fair share of adult jokes. It captured so many heartfelt moments, ultimately hitting home when the film concludes.Toy Story was the first beautiful full length CG animated film! For 1995, these animations were essentially flawless! The production designers in Patsy Bouge & Karen Robert Jackson, created these brilliant sets & set pieces, with amazing sizeable shots, to give great depth, and life to everything.The score & music by Randy Newman worked phenomenally with the story. Not only was You Got a Friend in Me, a smash hit, but Strange Things Are Happening To Me, as well.Overall, even though this film had very minuscule nitpicks, with the editing, and some circumstances, it was still almost flawless! This is my second favorite film by Pixar, and one of my favorites of all time.","

"TOY STORY","tedg","16 November 2008","I see that my previous comment on this film was deleted.This is the thing that started it all: Pixar. Somewhat photorealistic modeling. Deep, deep attention to story dynamics. An animated feature not so polished since ""Snow White."" Something worthy. Something that led to the reinvention of Disney.Its an iconic turning point, like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""2001,"" ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" Greenaway's ""Tempest."" (and others) Many things after change. So it should be seen on its historical basis alone. Here already you can see that Pixar decides to combine goals. They want the movie to be just as good as the best non- animated movie. There is the well-documented attention to refining and refining the story dynamics so that the narrative spine simply works. That took years. What I mean by combined goals is that they also realized that they were presenting something relatively new in their three D modeling capability. So they wanted to have that new cinematic vocabulary enhance the narrative dynamics and vice versa. It is subtle here, not fully developed until ""Nemo."" But its plain to see when pointed out: the camera simply moves in ways that a real one does not. There are a broader set of intimate and distanced observer perspectives. These are not overused, lest you notice them, but you can see that out tolerance and viewing skill has slowly evolved from this to the later Pixar projects. (At this writing, that is ""Wall-E."") The business about family and desired roles are not ""the point"" as some would say, but strategies to explore this deeper narrative power.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","

It features the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Annie Potts, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger and Laurie Metcalfe. Music is by Randy Newman.The first feature-length film animated entirely by computer, there's not a lot that can be said now that hasn't been said before about Toy Story, both as a film of heart and substance, and as regards its importance in the world of animation. Two further sequels would follow, both enormously successful and both equally as enjoyable. But it began here in 95, where Woody, Buzz and the gang operated on a level that beguiled the children whilst simultaneously bringing knowing laughs to the accompanying adults. Pixar paint a vivid colourful world, bringing us down to the toys level and etching in emotive threads about jealousies, friendships, neuroses' and the relationship between a child and his toys, while youthful splendour bathes the film constantly. Even though the plot is simple in terms of ambition, the characterisations are substantial and the film never panders to political correctness. The voice work of the actors is terrific, especially Hanks and Allen as Woody and Buzz respectively, their vocal comedy ticks wonderfully bring life to the animated figures, while Newman adds his optimistic tunes into the mix.Never maudlin or cheesy with its messages and sombre moments (something some other Disney films can't lay claim too), Toy Story's only crime is being too short at an hour and fifteen minutes (both subsequent sequels would rectify this issue). But it's a small complaint, probably (in my case) born out by greed for a longer adventure involving these marvellous creations. This was the start of a beautiful friendship for many, up there on the screen, and here in our own lives, thank you Pixar, you knocked it out of the park with this one, a film for all that keeps on giving delights with each subsequent revisit. 9.5/10","

"TOY STORY","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","9 July 2023","This is about getting older and losing status dealing with a new generation that wants to do things completely differently, through the metaphor of favorite toys, representing how the Western was overtaken by the sci-fi movie.I like that there are jokes for both the little ones and the adults. Puns and other verbal comedy. When it means to be tense and/or exciting, it legitimately does succeed. I really appreciate that the female characters are depicted as having emotional intelligence and compassion. All the toys have different personalities, some in contrast to the one one would guess - the T-Rex has anxiety, and can't yet roar in a scary way. Of course a lot of one-digit-agers love the idea of their toys being alive. I personally am grateful for this movie leading to the Army Men game series, since I greatly enjoyed the first two and some of the spin-offs.I've never been a fan of the fact that Sid is supposed to be the bad guy when he's just really creative. He doesn't know that the toys are alive, that he's torturing living things. Also based on the fact that he wears a black shirt with skull logo on it, he is either the Punisher as a teen, or a fan of the character, either way, awesome. His monsters are by far the coolest thing about the movie. I respect any kid's movie that is willing to admit that they can handle at least some horror. He's even nice enough to fix his sister's doll! I do appreciate the message of acceptance of those who are different that it does ultimately lead to. I agree with the interpretation that this film is about slavery, and I appreciate that the sequels help correct the issues that it brings up for this one - not sure anyone is gonna watch just one of these today.I've seen a number of people criticize the Randy Newman score, how it's literally spelling out what we're supposed to take away from the songs in the lyrics, so this is of course the part of the review where I would put it if I disagreed with that. As a matter of fact it would be this exact sentence that would express that.Overall, I definitely prefer Small Soldiers. I recommend this to everyone. 8/10.","

"TOY STORY","TheAvenger95","11 August 2014","This wonderful, heart-warming animated film has been considered a classic for many, many years.The story centers around Andy's toys who live happy, fun and peaceful lives, their only concern being birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could replace them. On one such birthday Andy's favourite toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself competing against Andy's new Buzz Lightyear action figure. When rivalries boil over, Woody tries to hide Buzz under Andy's bed, but accidentally pushes him out the window. The other toys exile Woody for this action, which leaves him no other choice, but to find Buzz and bring him back. However, with only two days before Andy's family moves, time is of the essence Not only is Toy Story a terrifically fun 80 minute adventure, but it also speaks about friendship and has underlying themes of what friendship really means and the importance of it. As a matter of fact, almost all aspects of the movie (such as the story, message, animation, voice cast, tone and humour) were extremely well executed.

"TOY STORY","Pjtaylor-96-138044","19 June 2019","'Toy Story (1995)' is written incredibly well; everything just seems to fall, very satisfyingly, into place. What sets it apart from pretty much all others in its genre is just how flawed its protagonist is. He's a borderline anti-hero, self-destructively selfish for the movie's majority. This makes his arc all the more satisfying, though, even if it's about as classic as you can get. The friendship that forms between the two central characters feels palpable and genuinely fulfilling because it's nuanced and consistently strained. It really is remarkable that a film about talking toys has some of the most satisfying character arcs and central relationships of all time. Of course, the piece is also very funny. It fully uses its central conceit to deliver some truly inventive laughs. It doesn't feel as though it's pandering to children, either; in fact, it feels rather mature, all things considered. It's a fantastic time that will resonate with everyone who watches. It really is a classic, one to be considered amongst the greats - animated or otherwise. 10/10","

"TOY STORY","StevePulaski","22 April 2011","Toy Story was the first entirely computer animated film in its time of release in 1995, and it puts Pixar on the map for a generation of amazingly crafted films to be made. The attention to detail is exquisite in this picture as reflections, flexibilities, and movement are all captured in such a stunning format it's almost too much to comprehend. Everything moves so fluently, is crafted with such a broad mind it's still astonishing to this date.CGI animation is made with wondrous creativity and the possibilities to show off it's style are virtually unlimited. Though when companies in 2011 make kids movies like these they forget about the storyline and just make the film loud and colorful to attract the youth's attention. Not Pixar. Pixar is so much smarter. They understand good animation and a great storyline with characters. Show me a Pixar movie that isn't at least above average and I'll show you a car that can you can drive with no wheels.But CGI animation has it's downsides. Being released in 1995, Toy Story was the first computer animated film. Meaning other companies were racing their technology where everyone wanted to take advantage of the CGI craze. The main company in this heated competition was DreamWorks Animation Studios. Their first feature film was Antz, notable for being almost a direct knockoff of Pixar's A Bug's Life which came out the same year (1998). Following Antz came others like Chicken Run and The Road to El Dorado. Still none of which lived up to Toy Story's caliber.DreamWorks scored big when releasing Shrek in 2001. It definitely put them on the map of animation companies, and it's surely remembered more than Chicken Run. But still, while Shrek had a more rapid fire sequel release schedule than Toy Story, none of which had the same heart, message, or love any of these films had.One last downside is that CGI, no matter which way you look at it, killed hand drawn animation. Generations of kids now likely will never get to experience the classic animation like they should. If they do they will most likely hate it after being exposed to all the glossy and more stylish animation that is among us today. But shows like Beavis and Butthead and The Simpsons are just as good.Enough with the animation history, lets talk about the film. I doubt anyone will disagree with me, that this is one of the greatest animated films of all time. It combines clever antics with loving characters you become attached to. It's funny to think toys have a mind of their own. Plus all the trouble they would experience if they were alive.Andy (Morris) is a typical child. He has a number of toys of different varieties and enjoys making up little adventures the figures can go on. All ranging from a Mr. Potato Head, a cowboy doll, a toy piggy bank, and others. Woody (Hanks), a cowboy doll, who now feels threatened when a flashy, gadget filled toy named Buzz Lightyear (Allen) is given to Andy for his birthday. Buzz impresses the entire gang of toys much to the dismay and fear of Woody that he will become another forgotten toy.Simple premise. Giant execution. It's everything and more. In the nineties, this animation was simply groundbreaking. Because this was the first film made by Pixar, the standard hadn't been set yet. But it was clear after Toy Story that animation would be forever changed for more than one reason.Starring: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Annie Potts, John Morris, Laurie Metcalf, and Erik von Detten. Directed by: John Lasseter.","

"TOY STORY","ElMaruecan82","11 January 2012","Almost 20 years have passed since the nineties  Now, we are so familiar with the cell- phones, Facebook and the Internet that we're totally amnesic regarding these years where we had none, and we all scratch our heads wondering how communication was even possible back then. Not too surprisingly, the same reasoning can be applied for animation: we're so used to CGI and 3D animated films that we forgot how groundbreaking Walt Disney's ""Toy Story"" was in 1995, and that we witnessed an event as historical as the release of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". It's not surprising, by the way, that the two films are the only animated features included in the American Film Institute's Top 100 List.The comparison with ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" doesn't only rely on the technical achievement and the critical recognition, but also on what drove these two crucial aspects: an endearing and universally appealing story. ""Snow White"" exploited all the comical possibilities of the dwarfs, in order to use physically distinct characters with different personalities attributed to each of them, while the Queen and Snow White could be modeled in more realistic designs; the setting also allowed the drawers to extend their talents and give it the touch of magic and escapism the audiences needed back then. ""Toy Story"" does the exact same thing, it chooses the best setting that can justify a clever and playful use of three-dimensionality, by creating a sort of underworld made of different forms and colors, a world where toys come to life when the owner is absent. This choice is a strike of genius because it provides an escapist value in our own environment, Disney made enough movies set in forests, mountains, jungles, so for its first 3D film, we have the first in-door Disney film, which gives an irresistible feeling of intimacy.This simplicity is the perfect counterpart to the complexity of special effects and the creativity of the screenplay because it also succeeds to add a little touch of nostalgia and hit a sensitive chord by waking the inner child inside of us. In 1995, we're in the midst of Disney Renaissance and its streak of successful films was so full of adventures and romance, thrills and laughs that ""Toy Story"" almost resonates as a comeback to the roots of the Walt Disney Company, childhood. Haven't we all played with toys when we were kids, whether they were dolls, Smurfs figurines, cars, monsters, haven't we all used our hands, totally invisible for our little eyes, and talked instead of characters, like magical puppeteers, imagining them sliding from a ravine that was our bathtub, or escalating a mountain, the bed-pillow. Toys were always alive for us, because our games were precisely what brought them to life, and in ""Toy Story"", we always have the feeling that the creators are less 'making a film' than playing with toys like we used to do, engaging a tacit complicity with the kids in the audience, and the inner kids within the adults from the audience.""Toy Story"" assumes that toys are alive, and the script is so well written that we're immediately convinced. There's no way Woody, the cowboy doll with Tom Hanks' voice couldn't be alive, that the cocky Buzz Lightyear is only a 3D talking image, that Mr. Potato Head isn't that grouchy figurine or that the Tyrannosaurus isn't that cute andcoward creature, all the toys that belong to little Andy incarnate Disney's magical power, bringing things to life, and we realize how we all had a Disney inside us when we were playing with our toys. And ""Toy Story"" couldn't have a more appropriate villain than a kid who destroyed toys, Sid: a character I despised so much because I was definitely not a Sid when I was younger. ""Toy Story"" is an odyssey in the world of toys after which we don't look at them the same way, calling them objects is almost insulting. Indeed, I've always felt guilty because as a teen, my mother told me to get rid of my toys, to give them to needier boys, and although I didn't play with them anymore, I remember how painful it was to say them goodbye, after ""Toy Story"", now I feel better with myself.And ""Toy Story"" doesn't just take its creativity and the cuteness of its characters for granted, there are the lines, the humor, but the story too, starting with the antagonism between the two 'lead' toys. Woody is jealous because Buzz, Andy's new birthday gift, became his best friend, in other words, his favorite toy, while Buzz doesn't know he's only a toy and lives in total denial about his true nature, which adds an unexpected bit of poignancy to characters that are not just three-dimensional on a geometrical level. The film has its share of action, mostly with the Buzz and Woody's duo trying to get back to Andy's house before the family moves in, but the emotional core of the film is their friendship. And progressively, their journey will allow them to understand the value of a toy, illustrated by Newman's Oscar-nominated song ""You've Got a Friend in Me""; there would still be room for Woody in Andy's heart and there's an inner nobility in toys in the way they bring happiness during our most treasured memories.'Toy Story"" is a beautiful friendship story between two lovable toys, (have you noticed that Buzz and Woody makes buddy if you associate them), whose friendship culminate at the moment where both 'fall with style' in Andy's box. And I guess this is why we hardly remember how groundbreaking ""Toy Story"" was, maybe we just forgot about the special effects and the whole 3D thing, and simply remember the beauty of the story.","

"TOY STORY","H4wke","18 December 2022","A simple and short film that was more monumental for the animation industry than people nowadays realise. To think that they were tentative about releasing a fully CG film because people might get bored, is absurd to think about now.Toy Story was a game changer, and it works well on multiple levels. Funny characters, a clever script and wonderful creativity exploring the hidden world of toys make for a joyful experience.I enjoyed it a lot as a kid, and the adult jokes that went over my head would make it even more fun nowadays, if I wasn't thinking about how my old, forgotten toys must be feeling...","

"TOY STORY","filipemanuelneto","16 December 2015","This film tells a story of rivalry between two toys: a cowboy doll named Woody and an action figure named Buzz Lightyear. They will fight for the affection of a child from the moment that Buzz is offered to him as a gift, threatening Woody's place as his favorite toy. A rivalry that will lead to a strong friendship between them. Directed by John Lasseter, one of the brightest minds of Pixar Studios, the film features the voices of Tom Hanks (as Woody) and Tim Allen (as Buzz) for the main characters.This was the film that launched Pixar to success, in a journey that still goes and deserves the respect of all admirers of the seventh art. The story of this film is deeply moving, not only to focus on strong themes like loyalty and friendship but, mainly, because it mess with our fondest memories by involving toys that we all played when we were kids. Its not a coincidence that we see, in this film, toys of our parents and grandparents living with action figures and games of our time. This film tries to touch everyone, from the small audience to the adults who take them to the movies. It's a great movie for the family and it's still current today, twenty years after his premiere.","

"TOY STORY","ThomasDrufke","22 June 2019","One of the few films that significantly shaped my childhood in loving films, Toy Story completely changed animation forever, and in my opinion for the better. In a mere 80 minutes, the film introduces us to a group of toys devoted to their beloved Andy and gets us to care about that relationship, to infinity and beyond. Everything from having ""Andy"" written on the toy's boots, to the menace that was Sid the next door neighbor, to Randy Newman's transformative music, to the bond that was formed between Buzz and Woody, Toy Story is a magical time at the movies.10/10","

"TOY STORY","Top_Dawg_Critic","12 July 2017","Toy Story is and will always be one of the best children's and adult's Disney animation ever created. As a parent, you dread seeing the same animated movies over and over again (kids never get bored seeing the same movie many times), but this one is different. I've lost track how many times I've seen it and it's just as enjoyable as the first time I saw it. Tom Hanks' voice is perfect for Woody, as is Tim Allen's as Buzz Lightyear and Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head. Love this movie and I don't think I will ever get bored seeing it. It's a perfect 10/10 from me.","

"TOY STORY","Jeremy_Urquhart","11 March 2022","I think I owe Toy Story an apology.Even though I watched it countless times as a kid, and enjoyed it as a (very young) adult when I revisited it in 2013, I think I've taken it for granted a bit.Because yes, it doesn't quite have the same emotional impact as 2 or 3 for me, and the animation is undoubtedly tougher... but it's still such a fantastically well made movie, and it's a testament to the trilogy as a whole that it started so well and only got better (as for Toy Story 4? I still like it, but it doesn't feel as essential).This is just so well written, packed full of jokes, filled with great characters, and it's such a unique and creative premise. Also, the character arcs and personal journeys that both Woody and Buzz go through simultaneously are fantastic, and both are examples of almost perfect character development. It puts the writing in most non-kids movies to shame.And as for the limited, sometimes dated animation? A lot of the time it still looks alright to be honest. They made it work well for the most part, by choosing to animate toys. It didn't matter if what they animated looked a little plastic or mechanical- that can just be how toys that come to life would function. It works.Music's also really good throughout, as is almost all the voice acting. It's a fantastic movie, and I'm excited to see if I enjoy the later entries in the series even more on a rewatch, too.","

"TOY STORY","stamper","2 November 2002","This first entirely computer animated film by Disney is a pretty good effort, but the film seems lacks that extra something, that makes it good. The action, which does not seem to stop is only' pretty thrilling and the film overall is only' kind of funny (I didn't burst out with laughter once). Therefore this film can not achieve the rating good (8 out of 10) by me, for a good film (in my opinion) is good on more than just one or two levels and it has to cover the entire film (preferably exceeding in more than one genre). Nonetheless this is (again) no disappointment by Disney.

"TOY STORY","zkonedog","11 March 2017","Until the Disney-Pixar collaboration that produced this wonderful film, movies were pretty much lopped into two basic categories: child & adult. Children would be lost, bored, terrified, or scarred by the adult fare, while adults would be lost, bored, and uncomfortable at the kiddie flicks. Fortunately, ""Toy Story"" changed everything.For a basic plot summary, this all-CGI film focuses on the childhood toys of young Andy. At first, Andy is in his ""cowboy stage"", and so western doll Woody (Tom Hanks) is his prized possession. However, once Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) arrives via an extra-special birthday present, things begin to change inside the toybox, as the two begin a battle for supremacy over young Andy.There are two main areas in which this movie succeeds so brilliantly: First, it is incredible eye- candy for children. Running the gamut from every type of toy and crazy situation imaginable, this film enraptures the kiddies and will have them watching over and over.Second, it works because you will be watching it over and over with them! As you marvel at the CGI effects, you will also be laughing at the hilarious jokes that, while going right over your kid's head, will make you burst into laughter. This is mainly accomplished by the cast of ""supporting"" characters such as the wise-cracking Hamm (John Ratzenberger), the cowardly dinosaur Rex (Wallace Shawn), the loyal dog Slink (Jim Varney), and the ever-sardonic Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles). Their jokes and humorous situations will make it feel as if you aren't watching a kids movie at all.Also, though the technology has come a long way even since this film's 1995 release date, it is still no less of a filmmaking marvel. For perhaps the first time in cinema history, computer- animation actually made you feel as if you were watching a ""real"" film, not just a cheap special- effects bonanza.Overall, ""Toy Story"" is one of the most influential films ever produced for its ability to blur the lines between children and adult cinema. For the first time, parents were truly able to enjoy a movie with their children.","

"TOY STORY","Groverdox","24 February 2023","People who aren't old enough to remember the '90s don't realise how much of a cultural touchstone certain films were. Everybody saw ""Jurassic Park"" at the movies more than once. Ditto ""The Lion King"". People could quote ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" without even having seen either movie because of the brand they left on pop culture.In some ways ""Toy Story"" might be the most revolutionary flick of the '90s. It is the first full-length CGI film. It marked the ascendancy of 3D-animation over 2D in film in the same way that ""The Jazz Singer"" showed the world that silent films would soon be replaced by talkies.Here's the point that matters the most for us, though: ""The Jazz Singer"" is only really remembered for its technical achievement in sound, if at all. If it weren't the first talking picture, it'd be forgotten about. ""Toy Story"", on the other hand, is remembered, simply, because it is brilliant.The movie is nothing but pure creativity and visual invention for its whole length. You can feel the influence of the old (even at the time) Warner Brothers cartoons with constant sight gags, and the quirky, lovable individuality of each character.The filmmakers also use feature film length to craft some incredibly beautiful, heartwarming moments into the story. The characters are not perfect, and at times even appear unlikeable. But the movie makes them so ironically human that when they redeem themselves you only love them more.The movie also evinces genuine heart-ache and surprising poignancy. The scene where Woody and Buzz realise that the deformed toys in the villain's room are actually not to be feared, that they're good hearted creatures just like the two of them despite what they've been through and what they look like: I thought that was beautiful in '95 age ten, and I thought it was beautiful now. And the villain, Sid's, long-suffering younger sister, just a sweet girl who has to live with her older brother's cruelty? I wanted to hug her, polygons be damned.Here's something else that's amazing about ""Toy Story"": I thought that the world's first CGI animated full-length movie, which is now almost thirty years old (!), would look a little dated, like the earliest cartoons do. It doesn't look dated at all. I don't know how they pulled that off.For all ""Toy Story""'s stunning technical achievements, for its somehow also reaching new heights in cartoon storytelling, for it accessing feelings in us we never thought it would bring out, I haven't mentioned what might have been the biggest revelation ""Toy Story"", and Pixar, brought us in the '90s. That is, the fact that a movie for kids has no reason to not be just as beloved by adults as any child. Gone were the days when adults suffered through kids' movies waiting for them to end. Pixar realised that the themes and lessons in their movies were just as valuable to the older generation as to the young. What children needed to be encouraged to remember, adults needed to be reminded. And in being reminded, ""Toy Story"", and all the other brilliant Pixar works that followed it, reminded us that childhood is never really gone, the child we were is still with us, needing to be loved and celebrated.Is ""Toy Story"" the best movie of the '90s? It's certainly way up there.","

"TOY STORY","Vartiainen","20 February 2018","In many ways Toy Story is just as big of a film as Snow White, or My Neighbor Totoro. It is the first of its kind, really. The very first feature-length computer-animated film and the founding stone of Pixar Studios. And quite like Snow White, it is still a marvelous film. With certain, minor caveats.First the praise. The story is still incredible. It has to be for the film to have withstood the test of time so well. It is about toys coming to life when humans are away at least partly because toys were much easier to animate than real humans (the humans in this film look scary, by the way), but great storytelling is often inspired by limitations. And that certainly applies here. Through simple childhood toys we explore the concepts of growing up, learning new things, meeting new people, dealing with failed expectations, fear of loss, abandonment and betrayal, letting go of things, and most importantly, about friendship and family. And it's all told through a fetching, relatable and kid-friendly narrative.The characters are also a lot of fun, though as a kid I never realized what a jerk Woody (Tom Hanks) really is. Sure, that's his point, but I always though that the cowboy had something of a point. Perhaps kids see these things differently. And nevertheless, the idea that Woody was in the wrong was clear even back then.Unfortunately what hasn't aged so well is the animation. The humans look terrible, yes, but that was clear even in 1995. But the toys were phenomenal back then. Mindblowing, quite frankly. Less so today. The movement is still really smooth and the designs are interesting, but it all looks so plasticky. The movie works around that admirably - most of the characters are made of plastic, after all - but it still leaves the movie looking flat and lifeless even when it's not supposed to look like it. I've heard it said that early hand-drawn animation looks charmingly simple, whereas early computer-animation simply looks cheap. And there's some truth to that, I'm afraid to tell.Still, Toy Story is a classic. Not my favourite Pixar film by far, but it did start something quite wonderful.","

"TOY STORY","jzappa","22 October 2008","Toy Story fashions an existence as its characters know it out of a couple of young kids' bedrooms, a gas station, and an expanse of suburban freeway. It also enters an arcade- restaurant that recaptures that consumerist wonder of being a kid surrounded by video games and pizza. Its heroes are toys, which come to life when nobody is watching. Its conflict is between an old-fashioned cowboy doll who has always been an 8-year-old boy's favorite toy, the effective leader of the kid's toys as a collective community, and the new action figure who is starting to take his place. The villain is the grungy kid next door who takes toys apart and puts them back together again in morbid mishmashes, that is when he's not blowing them with fireworks. And the result is an emotional roller-coaster of a movie experience that does not diminish with age.For kids, a movie like this works immaculately because it tells a fun story that presumably exists already somewhere in their minds when they are playing with their own toys. They can relate very deeply to these toy characters because of the role toys play in their lives. Older viewers can be even more immersed, because you find that after all these years, you still have such emotion invested in these toys. When Woody peeks from the toy chest at his boy, Andy, sleeping with Buzz Lightyear in his arms, I am truly touched. If you saw this as a kid and haven't seen it since, feeling you have outgrown it, you must revisit it, for you will discover quite the contrary.In a way, it could have been even more interesting and rewarding to have been your parents' age in 1995 when the film emerged as the first film animated entirely by computer. To us as kids, visual nuance was the last thing on our minds. The most rudimentary elements of the cinematic experience were all that mattered to us, and we were transported. Now, we are completely accustomed to Pixar's series of family films that transcend what one normally perceives as the cornball throwaway inanity of so many of them.John Lasseter opens the film in the---let's face it---spoiled 8-year-old's bedroom, where the toys come to life when their owner is gone. Each of the toy characters is rich and detailed. The playroom cunningly figures in well-known toys from real life, which may be product placement, but who cares when it functions as a great way for us to relate that much more with these characters by means of direct familiarity.","

Despite their differences, they eventually realize that they need each other in order to overcome a dangerous predicament.

"TOY STORY","drqshadow-reviews","24 July 2011","The visuals don't look as polished as you may have come to expect, so it's a testament to the quality of writing that this movie is still as good today as it was sixteen years ago. I can't undersell the ingenuity of the filmmaking either, as Pixar does more with limited technology and a thin rule book than most CGI artists can manage today. Careful, artistic shot selection and playful direction really do a lot to compensate for the occasional bad render, and a world-class cast of voice actors takes care of the rest. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen deserve every bit of recognition they get for their roles as Woody and Buzz; they really put the film on their shoulders and carry it right over the top, shifting something that would've probably been pretty good in other hands into a raging success story.","

Though the textures and human characters are quite dated by our standards, the story and film-making craft remain timeless. The comedy and suspense play off one another well, and rarely has a domestic setting like this ever felt so epic in scope. Like Disney's debut feature SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, Pixar's TOY STORY is imbued with a sense of playful discovery, innocence, and joy that lets it stand apart from the studio's later output. While they would go on to make more sophisticated films, TOY STORY's strength is in its simplicity and youthful spirit-- just a perfect movie in all the ways that matter.","

"TOY STORY","TOMNEL","11 March 2011","PIXAR is a brand that is now synonymous with quality, and it's not hard to see why this is. They have consistently made wonderful animated pictures that are very funny and heartwarming, and all have memorable and soon to be iconic scenes. They never pander to children, nor do they rely on cheap gags or melodrama. This film is the epitome of what PIXAR is about. ""Toy Story"" is one of the greatest animated films, that in recent years has only been topped by a few other PIXAR films.In the world this film sets up, toys are all alive, though they don't let that known to people. They play their roles are toys and when the people are not in sight, they talk about their job of being played with, and their personal lives. It's Andy's birthday, and all the toys in his room are worried about this fate with new toys coming in. Woody the cowboy doll is the leader of the group and is Andy's favorite toy, but Andy just received a new space toy, Buzz Lightyear, and now Woody is playing second fiddle and he doesn't like that. After mistakenly knocking Buzz out the window, the toys turn on Woody and he and Buzz end up on an adventure trying to find Andy and make it back to his house before he and his family move.The characters are always walking a fine line here, and never once do they fall off into one side. Woody could be very unlikable. He's always complaining, shouting all the time and he does some pretty mean things. Woody may be occasionally ill intentioned, but he is never malicious, and instead of being a complete jerk, he is often fighting between what is right and wrong and picks the former. The characters can be mean, but they're well intentioned in the end, and it's what shows in them. This film is of course a technical achievement, boasting that it's the first feature length fully computer animated movie. The animation looks great still today, but in a film world dominated by special effects and computer animation, it's very difficult to impress, but what still stands out about this film's look is it's visual style. From strange mid 50s interior designs to the atmospheric and beautiful golden hour look of certain scenes, this movie has such unique sets and shadows and just the atmosphere overall is very involving. The exciting chase and action sequences are also remembered and still today look dazzling. But what makes those scenes, namely the whole moving van sequence at the end, is the emotion. You feel for these characters, and the ""Falling with style"" callback that could feel contrived and corny, comes off as heartwarming. All the great scenes in the film have a level of humanity underneath all the negativity and cynicism of Woody that makes this animated toy feel very human.Randy Newman can be a little samey in some of his musical work, but his songs and score work very well here. The songs give us insight into what the character is feeling, and raise the emotion. His score plays off really well, and is catchy and bouncy without being cheesy. You'll find yourself singing these songs and humming the music after watching this.Toy Story is animated masterpiece. Unlike many of Disney animation's masterpieces, like the wonderful ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""The Little Mermaid"", this plays as a film instead of a great animated movie. It's a timeless film that will surely entertain many generations to come. It's a true classic!My rating: **** out of ****. 81 mins. Rated G.","

"TOY STORY","Zac_La_Porte","14 September 2021","It simply isn't acceptable to label Toy Story as anything slighter than a wonderfully timely, sweet, hilarious and inventive animation. It's also just as excellent that instead of relying on dumb styles of comedy for children, this classic chooses to stick to childlike playfulness and a beautiful animation technique that'll have all ages giggling together. Seriously, you need to enjoy this flick with the company of all your friends and family.The young children mightn't notice it, but the good old computer-animation operation is simply gorgeous, memorable and adorable. Unlike most animations today, Toy Story really gives you the childhood vibes. Everyone should accept the opportunity to watch this as a little kid. The imaginative toy characters, including Buzz, Woody, Potato Head and Slinky, are utterly charming and are mainly why this adventure-comedy will remain creatively flawless.We need to finally approach at least the mention of the brilliant voice actors. The voice of Tom Hanks is absolutely hilarious and witty behind our lead toy. The other cute characters are also accompanied by amazing voices, and that beside the charming visuals and clever ideas makes pure movie magic!If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","

"TOY STORY","KUAlum26","23 November 2005","PIXAR animation was but an experimental animation company that had a track record of short film contributions to film festivals when Disney invested in and ultimately released their first project,Toy Story. I figured Disney probably had a good feeling about this one,but I'm not sure they anticipated the kind of groundbreaking swell of animation this would shepherd in.The concept is a fitfully simple and cute one: when kids are away,their toys take on personalities and lives of their own,plotting,planning,bickering,reacting,flirting,etc. In this particular den of toys, a Cowboy Woody doll(voiced by Tom Hanks) is the leader,flanked by a Slinky dog(Jim Varney),green toy soldiers(aptly casted R.Lee Ermey as their platoon leader),a Mr.Potato head(Don Rickles), a Piggy bank(John Ratzenberger,forever Cliff Claven from ""Cheers"") and a Bo Peep doll(Annie Potts). Into the mix is a new,electronic Buzz Lightyear action figure(Tim Allen,who probably does the best voice acting of the bunch here),who almost instantly wows the locals and stirs jealousy from Woody.With music from Randy Newmann--a personal fave of mine--this movie's colors,attention to detail and wry humor make it easily adaptable to kids and adults alike. CAn it really be ten years since this film broke new ground on animation? How time flies in the wake of stuff like ""Shrek"" and ""FInding Nemo""!","

"TOY STORY","bankofmarquis","16 December 2018","With Toy Story 4 coming out in theaters this summer, I thought I'd go back and check out a beloved classice - the original TOY STORY (1995) to see if this film holds up to my memory of it.It sure does.Directed by visionary Pixar founder John Lasseter, TOY STORY is the first computer generated full-length motion picture and tells the...story...of toys that come to life when the humans leave the room. It is a simple concept that is executed beautifully with wit, charm and heart that sustains to this day and (I would imagine) to infinity...and beyond.Besides the revolutionary CGI work (which mostly holds up), the heartwarming story and the crispness of the pacing of the film, the masterstroke here is the pitch perfect voice casting. Tom Hanks was the first - and only - choice for Woody, the Cowboy doll that has been the main toy for Andy. His confidence is shattered when Andy receives a Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday and he struggles to maintain control of the room - and Andy's heart. In lesser hands, this character could be be annoying and a bit of a jerk, but with Hanks' inherent charm, Woody is lovable, neurotic and vulnerable as he tries to get out of one jam after another.Tim Allen wasn't the first choice for the voice of Buzz Lightyear, but with his success in 1994's THE SANTA CLAUS he was called into service on this film - and the results couldn't be better. He blends machismo, bluster and a sincere earnestness that perfectly pairs and counterbalances Hanks' tics to form a movie duo that ranks right up there with the best in film history.It is the attention to detail that these filmmakers really excel at and the supporting cast of voice actors really brings it here. From Don Rickles to John Ratzenberger to Annie Potts to R. Lee Emery to Jim Varney to Laurie Metcalf, all bring charm and heart to their characters even when they are in conflict.Speaking of attention to detail, the CGI in this film works really, really well - even after 23 years of improvements. The filmmakers were blazing a trail and there is much to look at in the background, from the 2 ""Hidden Mickey's"" in Andy's room to the tribute to THE SHINING, the background and renderings are lush and are worth a viewing just to look at hidden gems (and Easter Eggs) in the background.But none of this would matter if the story wasn't any good and I give story writers Lasseter and future Pixar Director's Pete Docter and Andrew Stanton credit for keeping the story crisp, clear and simple and infusing heart and sincerity without getting cloying or annoying. Interestingly enough, in looking at the credits, Joss Whedon, Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow were all contributors to the screenplay as well. When I see that many writers on a screenplay, I worry about continuity and flow. But, make no mistake about it, this film has a strong vision driven by Lasseter and the results on the screen show that focus.If you haven't seen this film in awhile, give yourself a treat and check it out again, it holds up very, very well and will be well worth the 84 minutes it will take to watch it (the shortest of all PIXAR films).Letter Grade A+ - which means, of course...A rare 10 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","

"TOY STORY","Michael_Elliott","22 December 2010","Toy Story (1995) *** 1/2 (out of 4) A kid's toy room is split after his former favorite toy Woody (Tom Hanks) gets replaced with the newest sensation Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). The gunslinger Woody can't except the fact that he's no longer the kid's favorite so he and Buzz end up outside of the house and must try and find a way back. The Pixar form of animation has become the standard today so I'm sure many people watching these films forget how groundbreaking this movie was when it was first released. I was only fifteen at the time but giving it a second viewing after all these years just reminds me at why this thing became a hit. Not only is the animation beautiful and extremely life like but we also got a terrific screenplay that certainly brings these characters to life and really makes them something special. The idea of a film being centered on toys that come to life when no one is looking is something so simple yet so genius that you can't help but wonder why it took someone so long to do a film. The screenplay is without question one of the best ever written for an animation movie as all of the characters, from Woody and Buzz to Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney) are perfectly brought to life. The child-like nature of the story has so much energy that you can't help but smile at each journey that the toys find themselves on. The amount of imagination in the screenplay is what makes it so special because it really does seem like something a kid would come up with while playing alone in his room with the toys. Everyone can remember what it was like being a kid and playing with these toys and bringing them to life in our minds so to see that played out on the screen is certainly something special. The film has terrific laughs but also a nice message. The voice work is terrific with Hanks and Allen clearly leading the way but that Southern draw of Varney is special as well. TOY STORY was ground breaking when originally released and it comes as no shock that the film hasn't lost any of its impact. The screenplay with its great characters and story is guaranteed to be enjoyed for decades to come.","

"TOY STORY","bobsgrock","26 January 2008","Disney used to be good, wholesome family entertainment that was not only clean but fun. Now, most everything they put out is outdated postmodern trash that portrays all children as geniuses able to rule the world and all parents as evil minions trying to keep their children from having fun. Thank God for Pixar coming to existence. Starting with Toy Story in 1995, they made a great family film that appeals to adult humor as well as children. They haven't failed since. They can do no wrong it seems, and I pray it continues that way. Of all their great films, this is undoubtedly in my mind the best of them all. It is also arguably better than any animated film Disney ever did, including the classics of the 1940s and 50s. The premise is so clever and daring in that it could go wrong in so many ways. It never does, though, and in a mere 82 minutes, it covers more information than many other 2 hour films. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen have become iconic in their roles as Woody and Buzz. The animation and dialogue is so good it is as if they are really on screen arguing with one another. The supporting characters are also very good and funny. With animation, perhaps the most important aspect is the voice characters. Pixar has done a great job of not always going with a star to do the voices, but rather simply going with the one that fits the character best. Overall, Toy Story is superb film-making with a great script, wonderful voices and animation that still impresses despite all the technological improvements. Thank you, Pixar. I am truly grateful to you for saving animated films.","

"TOY STORY","moonspinner55","15 July 2007","A kid's bedroom full of toys comes to life when humans aren't around; each toy, both new and retro-vintage, has his or her own individual personality, and they're all thrilled to meet the new member of the pack, birthday present Buzz Lightyear, who just may usurp Sheriff Woody in their pre-teen owner's heart. Disney/Pixar computer-generated cartoon has witty writing and incredible visuals to spare, though some scenes are heavy with chatter and the climactic race to catch up to a moving van is stretching things, even for a kid's picture. Still, some of the lines (which fly by at top speed) are very sharp and funny, and the star-voices (particularly Tim Allen's as Buzz) are uncanny. **1/2 from ****","

"TOY STORY","gcd70","23 March 2010","Cleverly crafted Disney production has plenty to laugh at for both younger and more mature audiences. The innovative idea creates a world in which children's toys come to life in their own universe; the bedroom.While the animation is not exactly state of the art any more, the pic benefits from some jovial, whole-hearted performances. Especially of note is the irrepressible Tom hanks as Woody, Andy's favourite toy (until now), and Tim Allen, hilariously deadpan as space ranger Buzz Lightyear, the new guy in town.The comedy stays fresh and lively throughout while there is always something happening to keep little eyes tuned. Infinitely watchable, as Disney often is.Tuesday, December 1, 1998 - Video","

"TOY STORY","Doylenf","19 December 2010","It's only now, fifteen years after its release, that I decided to give TOY STORY a look on my large flat screen TV. I've never been a fan of computer animation per se, but this charming story has heart and wit and enough entertainment value for both young and old. The toy characters are both appealing and very funny in ways that anyone can appreciate, thanks to a clever script.Woody the Cowboy and Buzz Lightyear compete for the affections of a small boy, Andy, whose playroom is loaded with toys that come alive whenever anyone leaves the bedroom. Out of this fresh idea, the plot bounces along with supreme confidence as it races forward putting all of them in constant danger from their ever changing environment, especially when they leave the confines of Andy's home.Technically, the film is a marvel--everything simulated through computer wizardry, all of it invented with taste for artistry evident in every frame of the film--the kind of artistry that the Walt Disney studio demonstrated during the heyday of their cartoon wizardry.The brilliant colors look even more amazing in the good print of the film that aired on cable tonight. Well worth watching for pure family entertainment, a rarity nowadays.","

Being older I realize it's not just entertainment but also a milestone in film making as a whole. This's the first movie to be animated entirely in CGI. The casts is amazing and really bring the characters to life. Tom Hanks as Woody has a blend between seriousness and hysterical which balances out with Tim Allen as the newcomer Buzz in his portrayal of a delusional hotshot. The supporting cast is amazing too. I really like Don Rickles as the snarky Mr. Potato Head, Wallace Shawn as the neurotic Rex and John Ratzenburg as the laid-back piggy bank, Ham.The jokes are hilarious. One joke that passed me as a kid was when Woody wanted to call him something but couldn't due to there being a kids toy nearby. Another is when Bo suggestively thanks Woody for saving her sheep during a play session with Andy. That's all i'm going to say. Toy Story's one of the best family movies ever made. It has something for both kids and adults. Hop on in and check it out.","

"TOY STORY","dweck","1 February 1999","If there's any justice in this crazy world of ours, ""Toy Story"" will become a classic in the mode of ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Snow White."" I look forward to its appearing every year on television, as a much anticipated ""event.""It certainly is groundbreaking, what with imagery that must've taken a computer system dwarfing the pentagon's to do.But I love how well-thought-out this movie is. The plot works from beginning to end. The performances are terrific--Tom Hanks and Tim Allen don't just blather their lines onto the soundtrack, leaving it for the animators to do all the work. No, rather, they're really *acting* here, imbuing their characters with as much depth and breadth as if they'd been playing flesh-and-blood people.Keep a sharp eye, movie lovers, inside gags abound: When Woody runs from an escaped globe, you'll think it looks just like the giant ball sequence from ""Raiders,"" and you'll be right! When Buzz walks amid a sea of tiny alien squeak-toys, Richard Dreyfuss' close encounter ""...of the Third Kind,"" of course, should echo in your mind.The look of the movie *is* stunning--and, IMO, it ""works"" in every instance but one: Syd's dog. Instead of looking canine, he looks instead like a fur-covered football.I wish Pixar had spent a few more pixels refining his ""look.""But all that's quibbling. Here's a movie for every kid who whiled away an afternoon while sprawled in front of a toy box and for every adult who ever wondered what happens to those Little Tykes people once you turn off the lights and go to bed...","

"TOY STORY","saadanathan","27 November 2020","""Toy Story"" is the first ever film by Pixar Animation Studios, and the film that started the golden age for Pixar. A classic well known movie that everybody loves and remembers after 25 years. The story is so original and creative that it's pretty incredible to imagine how the creators thought of the concept. The idea of toys living and breathing, all aware that they are toys is nothing less than genius. The fact that Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) doesn't even know he is a toy and thinks he's a spaceranger is funny and gives the film a better storytelling. Both characters Woody and Buzz are different from each other, yet have to work together in order to survive. All characters in ""Toy Story"" are amazing, funny and full of characteristic. An extraordinary movie that keeps its good taste even after 25 years, at high level with lots of nostalgia.","

I did get a few laughs out of the movie so I will not knock the film.So what is it about the film I dislike? The toys - not the actors voicing them - the toys themselves. All of the toys except for Rex (the T. Rex toy). I did enjoy the toon Rex - he was quite the comedy act. Mr. Potato Head was OK in the film but I never liked the toy as a kid - just boring to play with. The rest of the toys (or similar types) never interested me as a kid so they do not appeal to me in this film.It's a shame that I am not keen on this film since I really enjoyed films like ""Monsters, Inc."", ""Shrek"" and ""Chicken Run"".6/10","

The movie brings smart ideas, charming heart, and loving characters including Woody, Buzz, and the rest of the gang of toys. The movie begins with Woody, a cowboy toy, who used to be the star of the toy chest, until this new toy arrives after the owner's birthday, named Buzz Lightyear, a space ranger toy, with beliefs that he's a real space ranger. This leads into fr-enemy rivalry involving these two toys, until they learn the true meaning of friendship. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provide the voices for these well-known characters, and they did a great job of bringing talking toys to life. I thought the movie was excellent at writing some kind of every day diary through the eyes of toys. I think Pixar knows how to push the envelope with great ideas of animation, and they started this success with ""Toy Story"". I thought the movie is excellent in every way, it never leaves a single heart, and we grow up watching this movie and we never get tired of watching the old-fashioned buddy pictures, which made ""Toy Story"" a big success to critics and the box office.

"TOY STORY","ShootingShark","24 December 2006","The toys in Andy's bedroom are worried when he gets a new Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger for his birthday. Sheriff Woody is jealous, but when he knocks Buzz out of the window by accident, he must face the outside world and go rescue him.Toy Story is a World's First movie. The use of computer-generated animation had been pioneered in other films (Tron, The Last Starfighter, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, etc) and had been used extensively in short films (such as Lasseter's classic Luxo Jr., the origin of the Pixar company desklamp logo), but Toy Story is the original computer-rendered animation movie and its visual dynamics are simply stunning. In particular, the generation of movement through the frame (such as the point-of-view shot of Andy running up the stairs) and the ability to perfectly map any number of light sources to the motion of objects are amazing techniques previously unheard of in standard cell-painted animation. Lasseter and his incredible crew of artists have created an animation world which can duplicate almost anything a three-dimensional live-action movie could. It's an incredible achievement. Much more importantly however, it's a great movie - funny, scary, jam-packed full of great characters, and a terrific story. It has two ideas that are just brilliant; firstly, the central conceit of the toys coming to life, and secondly, Buzz struggling to come to terms with his identity. It kinda reminds me of a kids version of Robocop; on the one hand it's a goofy adventure story but on the other it's really almost a philosophical fable about a guy facing the meaninglessness of existence ! I also love the sheer variety of the toys, both visually and character-wise; as well as Andy's toys, Sid's monstrous hybrids are fabulous and the wacko three-eye greenies are hilarious (""Nirvana is coming ! The mystic portal awaits !!""). The voice cast are terrific, particularly Allen, Shawn and Ermey, and the movie sounds just as good as it looks, with excellent sound design by Gary Rydstrom. My one complaint is Randy Newman's song score, which is okay, but I'm afraid his laid-back LA showtunes style grates with me, and does he really need six credits for it ? Anyway, this is a great movie for everybody, kids and adults alike, and a genuine pleasure to watch. See if you can catch the shot they stole from Close Encounters Of The Third Kind.","

The story, the characters and the jokes are what draws you into the story and soon after you forget you're actually watching an adventure about living toys. The great voice acting helps too, of course. The result, a glorious collection of exciting and fun action scenes, is so perfect, you sometimes feel the urge to clap applause in responds to the events on the screen. The voice cast of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen fit the characters of Woody and Buzz so perfectly, this film should be seen as a major highlight in their careers. From Pizza Planet, to Sid's House and the race for the moving truck, this film features plenty of memorable scenes and locations. Randy Newman's song ""You've Got A Friend In Me"" is undeniably one of the best songs to be featured in a Pixar film, shame it didn't win the Oscar for 'Best Original Song' that it deserved. A classic.PS: Steve Jobs personally funded Pixar to make this film possible. So those who grew up with this film, remember this is another reason on how Jobs changed the world.","

"TOY STORY","imagiking","8 July 2010","With the ever increasing proximity of Toy Story 3, I decided it was about time for me to revisit the original and its first sequel to refresh my memory. Having been among the original target audience, it's a real trip back to childhood.The longtime favourite toy of young Andy, Woody is disgruntled to be pushed aside in favour of a new space-ranger action figure in the form of Buzz Lightyear. Admired by child and fellow toys alike, Buzz threatens Woody's territory, prompting an effort to remove him which results in the two being left many miles from home, with little time to get back before the family's move.Now regarded fondly as one of the best kids' movies of all time, Toy Story was the catalyst which allowed Pixar to rapidly ascend to the throne of animation where they dominantly remain to this day. Certainly it wowed me when I first saw it, almost fifteen years ago now. Indulging every child's fantasy that their toys come to life when they're not looking, we find ourselves instantly aligned with the host of strange characters. The quality of the animation, revolutionary for its time, is seen instantly, proudly boasted in the movements of the soldiers as they march downstairs. Everything looks completely realistic and, most importantly, believable. Whilst amusing beforehand, the laughs only really start to build up when Buzz arrives and we are treated to his interactions with Woody, the disagreements between the two and their petty arguments forming the basis of the film's funny factor. The added maturity of years affords the understanding of some of the film's more adult jokes, adding a little something extra to the experience for returning viewers. The action-adventure side of the plot keeps up the drama, tension, and sense of doom, keeping us wondering whether or not the reluctant duo will ever make it back in time. The scenes in Sid's house are the film's best, in terms of keeping up suspense. Their oddness is stand-out and ever memorable, the stranger toys therein encountered doubtlessly having haunted many little 'uns over the years. Certainly still enjoyable, Toy Story remains an inherently good film, though for me it stands less high than the likes of Wall-E, lacking the considerable emotional impact of that later Pixar effort.Carrying a vast legacy, Toy Story stands the test of time well, still as enjoyable as ever it was. Having paved the way for films which, as you would hope, took what it did and did them better, it is enduring, endearing, and thoroughly entertaining.","

"TOY STORY","lee_eisenberg","13 March 2006","Pixar became a household name in 1995 with ""Toy Story"", about cowboy Woody (Tom Hanks) and his rival, spaceman Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), who have to rely on each other's abilities and intuition to survive a snafu.I guess that this wasn't a masterpiece in the general sense of the word, but it's impressive nonetheless (who would have guessed that Don Rickles and Wallace Shawn would ever do voices in a cartoon?). And it of course set the stage for Pixar and Disney to collaborate on well done computer animated features in the years to come: ""Monsters, Inc."" and ""Finding Nemo"".I should identify that although this is G-rated, one of Mr. Potato Head's lines is not exactly G-rated (hint: it deals with a laser). But other than that, there's nothing objectionable here. Very interesting.","

This film is one of the rare beauties that does blend attractive visuals for the kids and a witty, funny script for the adults.  Throw away your expectations of a Disney movie, this is a step in the right direction for more ""mature"" viewers who still want to keep the young ones happy.  And we all know how pretty the film looks.  It really is a joy literally just to watch.  But the jewel in the film's crown is the sharp dialogue.  I challenge you not to laugh and Tim Allen's wonderfully self-centred Buzz Lightyear.  And his voicing is just one gem in a great cast.","

Pixar has had an outstanding run; they've knocked one out of the park every time they've been up to bat, and ""Toy Story"" set the standard. It contains that brand of cheeky humor Pixar has mastered, that makes its films both enjoyable at a basic level for kids and at a more sophisticated level for adults. Its films have gotten progressively more sophisticated, and I like movies like ""The Incredibles"" and ""Wall-E"" more, but this one is an awful lot of fun.Grade: A","

"TOY STORY","MUFCOK","24 October 2014","Toy Story is one of those movies which holds a lot of good childhood memories for me. I first saw it in the cinema as a child, it was then worn out on VHS tape. Played to death on DVD & is now owned on special edition Blu Ray. It is by far, one of my favourite ever movies. Everything about this movie is perfect. It is a subject which is relateable to every single person who has ever watched this film; that our toys came to life when weren't there. In Toy Story the toys don't just simply come to life, they have their own world, their own relationships, their own problems and conflicts. But above all else they have friendship, loyalty & a special togetherness. The story begins with the Toys in Andy's bedroom. It is the day of Andy's birthday party and the toys gather round anxious awaiting the news as to whether a new toy has been given as a birthday present, and if it is to be Andy's new 'favourite toy'. The toy that is handed over as a present is the brand spanking new, space ranger, Buzz Lightyear. All the other toys are all in awe of him, all toys that is, expect for Woody, Andy's current favourite Toy. Woody feels threatened by Buzz and has no patience when Buzz genuinely believes that he is a real space ranger & not a toy. The story progresses sending the toys on an adventure which is like no other seen before!The casting for Toy Story is simply perfect. Tom Hanks & Tim Allen put in fantastic performances as Woody & Buzz. The relationship they create is so believable and they develop fantastic chemistry throughout the film. The best thing about Toy Story is the way it manages to involve you in the film. It makes you feel all of the toys emotions & really makes you feel for them. But at the end of the day they are just toys! We shouldn't get that involved yet somehow we do! Toy Story has many hidden meanings and gestures which really drive home the message of friendship and love. They are not cheesy, they are touching and realistic. This is what Disney do so well, they make children's films but whilst doing so they create them so they can be related to by adults. The animation is also on the money, this movie is almost 20 years old but looks as good today on Blu Ray as any other animation. Toy Story also has one brilliant soundtrack with several songs which will stay with you long after you have watched it. Overall I cannot recommend this film enough and I would recommend anybody to go and watch it, no matter what your age.A timeless classic. 10/10","

The story is amazing and it took four creative screenwriters to write a good animated comedy film and it was just awesome to bring on screen.Do I really want to talk about this film so much? No. The acting in the film is cool and I think Tom Hanks and Tim Allen did great jobs as Woody and Buzz Lightyear and there are other voice actors including Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Annie Potts and Jim Varney as Slinky Dog and they all do great jobs in their performances.The music by David Newman is really amazing and the Oscar song, ""You Got a Friend in Me"", has been known as the Toy Story film series' theme song and it is performed by David Newman. The editing and animation looks very amazing and so fantastic and spectacular that I can't stop watching this film.The characters and setting is really amazing and just cool. The film is just really cool, from beginning to end and it is just fantastic.So, overall, I love TOY STORY and everyone loves this film and this is a film that kids can grow up with. 10/10.","

Yes, it's the first fully computer animated movie ever made and that's very impressive. For that reason alone, it will stand out in history. But I certainly never really thought it was the brilliant classic everyone else thought it was. Its animation is great but the story suffers from major pacing issues. There are entire moments of the movie right in the middle that bore me every time and don't stop boring me until I get to the film's climax, when it picks up again. A lot of trimming should have been done in the middle. Toy Story is good but its sequels are a lot better. So is it bad? No. But it's not brilliant. If this were 2-D, I doubt it would receive this high praise.","

The human faces are pretty dated but not so bad that you can't forgive it, given it's age. Woody and the rest of the toys have very good designs that you can't notice the age because of how old you are when you watched this movie for the first time they still hold up this is probably the third best Toy Story film in the franchise I think 4 was worse but 2 and 3 both stood out. I'd say 4,1,3,2 as the order of Toy Story films if I were to rank them, all of them are still A movies guaranteed. Feel free to disagree. The plot was easy enough for a 7 year old to grasp but still endearing after all these years. The adult jokes are spread throughout the film, the fishing rod with lady legs is an example.","

"TOY STORY","sngbrd39","5 June 2010","Toy Story will forever be remembered as the first feature film to be fully animated by computer. Since its debut in 1995, dozens more have joined it, including a sequel (soon to be two sequels as of this writing), as well as several other excellent films from its animation company, Pixar. However, for its unique accomplishment, Toy Story stands alone. It doesn't hurt that even beyond the technical achievement, the film is charming, well-written, and touching.The toys in question belong to Andy, who has a huge variety of them scattered around his room. The unofficial head toy is Woody, a cowboy toy who has ""been Andy's favorite since kindergarten"". Woody loves being the favored toy, but the order is shaken up when Andy receives a surprise present on his birthday: a Buzz Lightyear action figure, who causes Woody to become jealous when he begins to take over the #1 toy position in Andy's playtime.There's a lot of good stuff in this film: The animation, which mostly still works 15 years later; the voice acting, which is carried out excellently; the story, which keeps viewers engaged throughout. What gets me most about Toy Story is the way that both Woody and Buzz must grow throughout the movie. Woody has to let go of his jealousy and accept that things change when someone new enters the mix. Buzz has to learn (the hard way) that he really is a toy, but that he has a very important role as such. This is better character development than we see in some ""more mature"" films. It was here that Pixar began a long line of memorable, excellently crafted characters.Pixar has released ten feature films in the past fifteen years. Toy Story 3 this summer will make eleven. They've maintained a very high standard of quality during that time. It definitely helps that, with Toy Story, they were off to an excellent start.","

"TOY STORY","sashank_kini-1","31 May 2007","After hearing about the success of the toy story series, a rented a DVD which had a collection of Toy Story 1, Toy Story 2 and Monsters Inc. I loved Monsters Inc. and Toy Story 2 but I did not enjoy Toy Story 1 even that much. These were the points that I didn't like in the movie: 1) In the starting, when Andy is shown playing with the toys, he starts to get a bit annoying after he keeps on playing with it. His love for the toys throughout the film bugged me after a while. But I did not find this too boring as even my cousin is a great fan of Spiderman and keeps buying and playing with the toys.2) The animation looked a bit faded in the movie. But I didn't pay much attention towards it giving an excuse that it was made in 1995 and compared to Finding Nemo and the other new movies, its animation would be a bit duller.3) Sorry Tom Hanks, but I found your character quite annoying in the film as you kept screaming like a mad character and I did not like you that much.4) Woody's girlfriend in the movie had a terrible voice. I expected a cute shepherdess's voice to be more cute and sweet rather that being a bit rough and sounding like the second woman in a love story.5) Mr.Potato head and the other characters, except for the spring dog, really annoyed me when they were reluctant to listen to Woody. I mean, why couldn't they just wait and understand him.6) The bad boy removed some parts of his toys to make them look terrible. But towards the end, when the toys help Woody and Buzz, Woody thanks them and just leaves. Why didn't he tell the toys to leave that stupid place and run away with them? They should have included these characters in the second film, at least.7) Toys had lives in the movie. So why did they not just start living alive with the humans? Why do they fall still when their masters came? They could play alive with them.The movie had some good points too. Here are some of them: 1) Tim Allen has done a fantastic voicing as Buzz, and I liked Buzz in the movie as he was shown brave, his voicing was done well and he didn't bore me at all.2) The dog who supported Woody was cute and I liked him, just, I liked him, in the movie.3) The movie was different from other movies, as here, toys were shown as the protagonists.4) The dinosaur was funny and his character uplifted the film.Overall, I don't think it deserves to be in the top 250 movies. But its the people's choice and if they wish that it would be in the top 250, then I can do nothing but give my review on the film.","

"TOY STORY","pickle-92642","21 July 2021","An absolute classic of my childhood. It holds up very well. This may be one of the films that I've seen the MOST, considering I watched it a ton when I was a little kid. So much of my young life was themed around this movie. It remains one of my favorites and is one of the best animated movies of all time. Not to mention it kick-started Pixar's reign of excellence. The animation is starting to look a bit dated, but cmon. It was 1995, this was probably the best animation anyone had ever seen up to that point. The story is perfectly written and the concept is even better. Whoever came up with the idea of talking/walking toys with personalities whenever the kids weren't looking is a genius and should've got a nice fat paycheck. I don't know if this'll end up being the BEST pixar movie after my rewatch, but it will definitely be one of the best. Nostalgia definitely has a factor in it, but even so on a technical level this is one of the beat. Like how could you NOT like this movie? Disliking this is like disliking candy or cats/dogs/pets or ANYTHING THAT BRINGS JOY TO THE WORLD.","

"TOY STORY","StartingAllOver14","22 September 2007","""Toy Story"" was, as known, the first movie of Pixar that should ""conquest"" the world after Disney's hand-drawn films were consider as mediocre. Except ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Cars"", ""Toy Story"" is the best of all the Pixar films (here comes a little SPOILER; this movie is not presented with the Pixar logo at the beginning of the film, before the title credits. SPOILERS OVER). It's like some TV-series; the first seasons are sometimes the best, right?Anyway, I watch ""Toy Story"" for the first time when I was 11 and I enjoyed it. It's never been my favorite movie of all times, but it's a enjoyable and watchable movie. The animation is gorgeous, the story is simple, but well-defined and the script is good. It's a good idea to make a CGI computer animated movie about toys that comes alive (SPOILERS; when the humans aren't watching. SPOILERS OVER).This film has some more adult humor comparing to the Disney hand-drawn films before 1995, which is quite good. (SPOILER) Most of the characters are simple and well-defined, except the sarcastic Hamm and Mr. Potato Head (not that I dislike them, but they deliver a more sophisticated humor than the rest of the characters). Woody is a more human main character, who makes really big mistakes in the movie, but learn what's wrong and what's right. My favorite characters were Buzz (I absolutely love his lines), Slinky (who stand up for Woody more than he deserves) and Scud, Sid's dog, who definitely should be in the sequel. (SPOILERS OVER).This movie has some scenes that could may be considered a little spooky for the youngest children, but for those who are 8 years old and upward, it's a suitable movie What I didn't like in this film is the score of Randy Newman, who is actually very annoying and too sugary for me. Unfortenaly he became the composer of most of the Pixar's film. But the songs in ""Toy Story"" are working quite all right. Not that they are so memorable, but they don't destroy the movie.So ""Toy Story"" it's a funny and enjoyable movie worth watching.","

"TOY STORY","djansen24","8 September 2011","Pixar strikes out in feature films with its first full-lengther, and the results are stunning! They set the bar almost impossibly high for anyone else interested in getting into full length computer animation. But what made Toy Story have such staying power and make the characters immediately house-hold names wasn't so much the technical brilliance (although it did dazzle), but the storytelling. Okay, case in point. Independence Day. The media hyped this up and it got a lot of viewers. It had a lot of effects. It dazzled our eyes (not our hearts) on the big screen. It sold a lot of DVDs. It made a lot of money...during its run. So who remembers it much now? For that matter, who will remember much of just about any of Roland Emmerich's films years from now? But who can forget Woody, Andy, Buzz, etc.? Who can forget that bedroom? Who can forget Sid? The writers at Pixar took a great idea which was understanding how many of us (even as adults) have emotional attachments to our toys and found a way to bring the heart of that idea and nail it down to a heartwarming story about friendship. That the technical details are flat out amazing for its time was an added bonus (even seeing reflections from Buzz's space helmet -- they didn't have to do that! The animators threw that in just to make the experience all the more special and believable). No other studio has ever come up to the standard set by Pixar. Dreamworks hasn't, though they have made a good film or 2. Sony Pics hasn't, etc. etc. Because they lack a great story to begin with, and when they do land upon one, they muck it up by trying to make it something it isn't. I can almost hear the writers in their studios thinking, ""Well, this is good, but we need to add more adult jokes so that the parent's won't get bored."" Advice, just follow Pixar's example and let the story unfold as it needs to. Pixar got it right and has gotten it right up through Toy Story 3. I fear we may be in for a nadir of creativity as we move into Cars 2, but we'll see...","

"TOY STORY","chrisbishop5000","22 February 2011","This movie is just awesome! Bearing in mind that this was a film from 1994/95, the quality of the realistic 3D animation is stunning and what a perfect way to start a new era! Just as a new form of animation comes to life, a vast number of toys magically come to life when their child-owner Andy is out of the room. Maybe that's a true-to-life symbolisation! From the word go, every single one of those toys have become so famous and iconic. Argos (especially), Toys R Us, Amazon, Woolworths and more have never, since the film's 1995-release, been without stock of them! Like it says in the summary, it's a heart-warming story as well as a funny, super-cool movie about a pull-string ragdoll (Woody) whose popularity is short-lived as Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday as a result of new electronic toys hitting the market proving to be better than a just a ragdoll. Understandably, Woody is jealous of Buzz and can't stand his guts. He's an arrogant, self-interested toy but, more than anything else, an total, utter idiot.All the toys have their own personalities; there's Little Bo Peep who has a soft spot for Woody, Slinky Dog who likes Woody and is very friendly, Rex the world's most IRRITATING dinosaur ever, RC, the RC who revs up and down rather than talks and then there's Mr Potato Head and he is VILE! So, so mean and frequently rude. He seems to have some kind of vendetta against Woody for no reason I can think of. Then, he creates his very own campaign to destroy Woody in order to avenge Buzz when Woody's the one who has felt lonely and unwanted for so long! You'd think it'd put children off the authentic Mr Potato Head by Playskool! Oh yes and there's one more toy I didn't mention - Lenny, the toy-sized pair of binoculars. He was voiced by Joe Ranft who contributed in the story development of ""Toy Story"" and is now sadly no longer on this earth. He was killed when the speed of his car went beyond control, crashed through the wall of a bridge and plunged into the river below. The Pixar team miss him terribly...JOE RANFT 1960-2005","

"TOY STORY","rneil95","3 June 2010","I love Toy Story. Plain and simple, it's a phenomenal film. Not only is it one of the most well-made animated films ever made, it's also one of my favorite films in general. It's incredibly appealing story, the voice acting is perfect, the characters are very likable and fun to watch on screen, and the animation is stellar for it's time.The basic premise of TOY STORY is life seen through the eyes of a toy. The film centers around the toys belonging to a boy named Andy, particularly following his favorite toy, a stuffed cowboy doll named Woody. Woody is primarily the one in charge of Andy's room, but his authority is threatened when Andy gets a new spaceman toy named Buzz Lightyear. The only problem is that Buzz doesn't know he's a toy. He genuinely thinks that he is a real space ranger.Tom Hanks voices Woody and Tim Allen voices Buzz, and both do a stellar job. I couldn't ever imagine anybody voicing these two characters besides Hanks and Allen. The supporting cast does a wonderful job as well, such as Jim Varney as Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as Rex, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Annie Potts as Bo Peep, John Ratzenberger as Hamm, and others. The characters are so fun to watch, and you truly care about them as you watch Woody and Buzz form a friendship. At it's heart, Toy Story is a buddy movie, and one of the best made at that.While the animation seems somewhat dated today when compared to PIXAR's more recent films, the film does still look very nice. Looking back at the film, it truly is a technological achievement as well as a film-making achievement in general.Being the first animated film done entirely through computers, Toy Story had a lot of expectations to meet. And not only does it meet expectations, it surpasses them to infinity and beyond.","

"TOY STORY","purplefairy","24 November 1999","This movie has it all. Simple enough for children to enjoy, and yet with enough subtle humour for adults to enjoy as well. In fact, this film was made more for adults than for children I suspect-much of the humour is subtle and adult oriented, and as the makers admit, many of the toys are ones they played with in their childhoods.The toys in the film are actually better actors, and convey more emotion, than most ""actors"" in films today. Kudos to Pixar for an excellent job.A must-see film, it has something for everyone, and loses nothing on repeated viewing. I saw it 3 times at the cinema, and then bought it on video, and have probably seen it 50 or so times at home, and yet it is still funny, and I will happily watch it again.","

"TOY STORY","Spleen","25 September 1999","Think of momentous years in Hollywood's history like 1927 (the year of the first talkie), 1932 (the first use of three-colour technicolor), 1935 (the first feature in full colour), and 1937 (the first animated feature).  I kept telling myself, in 1995, that I was witnessing something equally ground-breaking and historically important.  And who knows, maybe I was. The four historic films I alluded to above were `The Jazz Singer', `Flowers and Trees', `Becky Sharp' and `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', only the last of which has any claim to being a classic.  `Toy Story' has no great claim, either.  In retrospect it was nothing new, just another instance of Hollywood's current infatuation with computer-generated images: pleasant, light and unremarkable.Computer animation is really a soulless device and, although I found it enjoyable, this is a soulless movie.  To begin with the animation wasn't quite ripe.  Toys, I suppose, are easy to animate: but when the flesh-and-blood children start to look as if they're also made of plastic, when the whole world seems to be made of plastic, the eye longs in vain for something else.Perhaps including children at all was a mistake.  A Hans Andersen toy story, a story that concerned toys and only toys, would have been more fun (and more moving).  The film betrays itself when it starts to think of the children.  The two central characters, after all, are BAD toys - horribly gimmicky devices that children very sensibly lose interest in after not so sensibly getting their parents to buy them some other worthless gimcrack. When Woody gave his speech about how important they really were in servicing a child's dreams and wishes and whatnot ... did anyone really fall for it? It would have been much more honest if he'd said, every toy for himself, kids be damned.I'm sorry if I sound overly critical - as I said, I liked it, so for me at least the slightly sour taste wasn't strong enough to ruin the film.  John Lasseter deserves credit for taking a formulaic buddy tale and breathing genuine life into it.  (All the more credit with a medium as unyielding as computer animation.)  `Toy Story' is pleasant and fun.  But frankly, every single traditionally animated film Disney has made from 1989 on, with the possible exception of `The Hunchback of Notre Dame', is better.  And - sorry to close with a carp - did Randy Newman really have to break into song so often?  Wasn't it enough for him to write the score, without croaking his songs out over it?","

"TOY STORY","wolverinesforever","22 December 2015","What more can be said? 20 years ago, Pixar released ""Toy Story,"" and the rest is animation history. Computer animation has since become the dominant form of animation. Dreamworks, Warner Brothers, and Universal (and maybe some other companies I have forgotten) have created their own computer animation studios to rival Pixar. Pixar themselves would continue to push just how far animation could go, both in animation quality and in storytelling ambition. So one may wonder, 20 years after this all got started, is the one that started it all still excellent by today's standards? The answer is an emphatic YES.The story is fairly well known by now, but I'll repeat it anyway for those who are unfamiliar. This ""Toy Story"" centers around the toy cowboy Woody (wonderfully voiced by Tom Hanks). Woody is the favorite toy of the young boy Andy (John Morris), who has several other toys, including Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Slinky Dog (the late Jim Varney), and Hamm the Piggy Bank (John Ratzenberg, whose consistent appearances in Pixar films has become a running gag of sorts - and was acknowledged as such in ""Cars""). The film starts on Andy's birthday party, a time when all of his toys get nervous, because Andy might get a toy that he likes more than the others. Sure enough, he's received the latest ""cool"" toy, spaceman Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen, an inspired choice). This results in Woody being demoted to ""second best,"" something he doesn't take well at all. Woody attempts to push Buzz out of the way so he can get back to being Andy's favorite toy, but through a series of mistakes (and misadventures), he winds up making both he and Buzz separated from their owner Andy. Worse, they end up in the possession of their neighbor, Sid (Erik von Detten), who prefers to blow up his toys instead of play with them. Now Woody and Buzz have to make peace and work together if they are to return to Andy (oh, and did I mention that Andy is moving away soon?).The premise is simple enough, but it's in the execution where things get very inspired. Take, for example, how the toys attempt to learn what presents Andy is receiving. They send several Army Men Toy Soldiers down for a ""Code Red"" mission, and how these soldiers pull this off always puts a smile on my face. I still remember being inspired by watching the soldiers move that radio into that small leafy plant on the bottom floor (I was seven when I first saw this). I was so inspired, in fact, that a year later, I was ""teaching"" my toys how to hide in the Christmas tree during Christmas. Director John Lasseter and the Pixar team have deeply considered how a world of toys would work. How would a toy feel about getting relegated to ""second best"" when a new toy comes around? And it's pretty fun to see how the toys have to consistently make sure the ""human world"" never knows about their awareness.And the strength of this script goes beyond its consideration of a world of toys. Its tight and to the point. There are no wasted moments in the film's (short) 81-minute runtime. Pixar is not satisfied with simply showing what computer animation can do. They are interested in guiding along through a story that provides laughs, thrills, an occasional scare, and something valuable to learn at the end.Obviously, the quality of computer animation has improved greatly since this film first came out (watch how they animate a dog here, and compare it to how Pixar would animate Sullivan's fur in ""Monster's Inc."", for example). But let's remember, at the time, this was considered to be massively advanced animation. Many adult critics wondered if kids would realize just how big of a breakthrough this was in the history of animation, but I can reassure them, I may have been only 7 years old, but even I realized an entirely computer animated film was a very big deal indeed! Looking back now, I do think we should consider some of the things the animators did in this film that further emphasized what computer animation should be going for. Gene Siskel pointed out that you could see a reflection off of Buzz's helmet (and even stated, as a compliment, ""They didn't have to do that!""). The toys, the settings, everything was beautifully rendered and still looks good today. Even if one just reduced this picture to its visual qualities (inadvisable), they would still come out quite satisfied.Today officially marks the 20 year anniversary of when I saw this film (December 22nd, 1995), and it's high time I got to writing a review of it. ""Toy Story"" absolutely changed movies, and that is not a hyperbole. It's popularity made others realize the financial potential in computer animation. It's quality made everyone realize just what computer animation could (and should) pull off, both in visuals and storytelling. Pixar themselves would start a very long winning streak of highly acclaimed pictures, with many seemingly getting even more glowing reviews then the picture before it (heck we've gotten two great ""Toy Story"" sequels to boot). That this film still holds up even though many envelope pushing animated pictures have been released since is impressive indeed.20 years later, ""Toy Story"" still rocks!","

This movie show some kind of magic, that I can't explain, and just fascinates me.Revolutionary, ""Toy Story"" was the first of all the great 3D animated movie. It's voice casting is just perfect, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen give memorable performances (Like the scene where Woody yells at Buzz ""You are a toy!"") making this movie unforgettable. The animation itself is great, although nowadays animated movies are a little bit better animated. The songs in this film are moving and exciting sometimes, witch gives a beautiful touch to the movie.But that's not the best part of it. The problems and dilemmas that the characters experience, are so good, that it may sound a little too complex to a kid's movie, the fact that buzz can't be real astronaut and that he has to settle with being just a toy is just brilliant, and like I said before, uncommonly intelligent. And also the situation where Woody has to prove his ""Ex-friends"" that he didn't kill Buzz, that is for me what makes this film different than any other animated film (""UP"" also has an intelligent plot, but the execution is not as good as this one).Verdict: Magical, touching, and quite brilliant, ""Toy Story"" is a lot of fun.","

I recently picked up the DVD and was instantly pulled in again. I ended up watching it again two days later. Anyway, I must point out that watching it when you're a child and watching it when you're an adult will result in two different experiences. Watching it recently I laughed my arse off at jokes I didn't even know were jokes back then; even simple things like ""Buzz LightBeer"" can have quite an impact.Alright then, enough of that. The film is 100% perfect the way it is. The characters are so full of personality, so full of humanity, and how it perfectly expresses emotions of loneliness, rejection, and love through a couple of toys is astounding. The movie has a sort of episodic appeal to it, wherein each episode leads to one collective end. It also seems that the worst that can happen to our protagonists does happen. It makes for one unpredictable plot. There's plenty of darkness here, especially with the whole Sid scenario, or when Buzz tries to fly. Did I mention the soundtrack? Randy Newman was perfect for this job; the music has a childish aura to it, but also helps accentuate the emotions of certain scenes. Can't imagine why he wasn't asked to work on the sequel. Anyway, Toy Story has received countless awards, and it is my opinion they are deserved.","

"TOY STORY","ametaphysicalshark","4 June 2009","Afraid this doesn't really hold up that well. You hear so much about great wit, but that comes only in short fits, a few good lines here and there. I know they're toys, but the characters in ""Toy Story"" largely suffer from the sort of super-quirk ""Juno"" and ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and the lot suffer from. It's basically really quirky toys talking to each other and facing acts of villainy and committing acts of heroism for an hour and a half. The animation is impressive considering when it was made but unlike hand-drawn animation from the old Disney films it HAS dated, and noticeably, often looking like a video game cutscene now. The voice work is fine, but there's just nothing truly interesting about this world or these characters. It's a pleasant enough movie and occasionally very fun, but the overwhelming affection for it seems to me the result of nostalgia and memory rather than any lasting value. Compared to the rip-roaring adventure of ""The Incredibles"", the spine-tingling melancholy tone and sophisticated ideas of ""WALL-E"", or the sense of longing and loss and adventure in ""Up"", ""Toy Story"" falls short. Very short. In fact, I'd much rather take the small-town nostalgia of ""Cars"" over this. A good starting point for Pixar but nothing even remotely approaching a classic.","

"TOY STORY","tonyum","13 August 2022","It´s about time we review another Pixar film, but the question is which one? Well, how about their first one. Toy Story, released in 1995, was the one that started it all, and not just the Toy Story franchise and Pixar as a whole, but the medium of 3D animation (the premiere form of animation and the only animation medium that makes money nowadays), and what a bang it started on.Its obvious selling point is the animation, which was not only groundbreaking at the time, like I said before, but it really captures the essence of a toy with the models´plasticky look, and it´s greatly detailed in some areas.Another great thing is the story. While the trope of ""character doesn´t like the new guy who gets more attention than him"" is a very common trope found in kids films today (even the general concept of toys coming to life itself was very common back in the day), this is the one that pulls it off the best, with several underlying themes of identity crisis, hopelessness, friendship and the true meaning of a toy, wether old or new, while also telling the best redemption story of a jerk character (even if Woody can be a bit too mean and shouty in some instances, but it´s better than the deleted ""Black Friday Toy Story reel"" Woody).Speaking of which, the characters are endearing and unique in their own way, with distinct, memorable and charming personality, further enhanced by the amazing performances by actors such as Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, and the fantastic humor.The last great thing about this movie is the classic Randy Newman score, consisting of several unforgettable songs like ""You got a friend in me"", ""Strange Things"", ""I Will Go Sailing No More"", I could go on.If there´s one thing bad I could say about Toy Story 1 is, while this was the first fully computer-animated movie, the animation, while still amazing and still good to this day, can look a bit dated in some areas, such as the models for the humans and dogs and a couple of facial expressions. That said, however, it´s still overall great and up-to-date (so to speak) with our modern standards. And hey, some of these dated moments gave us some good memes and YouTube Poops in the future, so there´s that.But overall, Toy Story is fantastic in almost every area, with a great story, good visuals, a great sense of humor, great messages, an amazing score and one of the most likeable and memorable cast of characters that I´ve seen in a kids movie. While it may not top its first two sequels, it´s still a grand old time even to this day, wether you´re a kid or an adult.","

"TOY STORY","ilikepuppies","19 May 2007","The opening scene says it all. Film-making begins in early childhood, as children use their toys to create little scenes (or movies if you will). The word ""play"" when used to describe such activity indeed derived from the movies of another era, plays. Or perhaps the other way around. Either way, the point of this film is to show that creating a film and playing with toys are virtually the same thing.So the film is basically about itself. A play about playing. This is exactly the type of multi-layered construction that I believe subconsciously challenges and nurtures our kids' minds. Teaching a child (or adult!) to think on more than one level at a time is simply a gift.It should also be applauded that it's all substance and no fluff. Other animation teams have inundated their films with meaningless pop culture gags, camp, and nostalgic irony. Not to mention an abundance of toilet humor. Music by the great Randy Newman instead of the Village People.None of the mindless pandering to adults here, either, yet we are included in the fun by being subtly reminded of our own play days. Barrel of Monkeys. Potato Heads. In fact there is a strong undercurrent theme here as the classic cowboy toy is threatened by the flashy new space man who is obviously being pushed on kids via a relentless marketing campaign. We 30-somethings must root for Woody. It's Wal-mart vs. our favorite mom-n-pop corner store.These Pixar guys are brilliant, and I believe they will be revered someday as perhaps the most important influence in all of filmdom during the turn of this century's period. There is no more sure thing than a Pixar offering. Always compelling, engaging, intelligent and abstract. And this one is the best.","

Toy Story is about a boy named Andy who, like most of us, had many toys as a kid, but there was always that one special toy that we just played with all the time. For him, it was cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks from ""Big"", ""Apollo 13"", ""Saving Private Ryan"") who feels he'll never be replaced. That all changes on Andy's birthday when he gets a cool spaceman toy, Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen, from the hit 90's sitcom ""Home Improvement"") and all of a sudden, Buzz is his new favorite toy. After ending up stuck in a game machine where ""The Claw"" picks both of them up and a dangerous boy named Sid (voiced by Erik von Detten), has some pretty evil plans for them. This movie has everything a good movie should have: great story, amazing, unforgettable characters, good music score and songs composed by Randy Newman, and some great messages on friendship. Other voices talents include Jim Varney as Slinky, John Ratzenberger as Mr. Potato Head, Don Rickles as Ham, and Wallace Shawn as Rex. Will Woody and Buzz learn to coexist? Can they with the help of some mutant toys foil Sid's evil plans? The only way to find out: Watch Toy Story. You should and I hope won't be disappointed if you haven't seen it. Rating:10/10!","

Woody sees his position as leader of the toys threatened, and an act of jealously leads him through an adventure where he must put things right.I was 5 when i first saw this movie, and i thought ""man, this is awesome!"" and since that day, i've always said this is my 2nd favorite Disney film (the 1st being beauty and the beast) because it set the bar for many computer animated films to come. sure nowadays we have films like Wall-E and Up, also made by Pixar, but Toy story will always have a place in every Disney fan's hearts.Plus, i personally will go to the theaters, to see toy story 3 when it comes out a day before my 20th birthday. i have to.10/10","

Computer animation was a new thing at the time but Toy Story proved that the medium was more than a novelty act and was going to be around for a while.Woody (Tom Hanks) is Andy's favorite toy until Buzz Lightyear, a spaceman voiced by Tim Allen, arrives on the scene. To quote Randy Newman's song from the film, strange things begin to happen to Woody when he loses popularity with the other toys and is accused of trying to kill Buzz out of jealousy. Soon things go awry for the toys when Sid, Andy's sadistic neighbor, gets a hold of Woody and Buzz. The toys have to learn to work together and forge an alliance in order to survive.Great story and voice acting all around makes Toy Story a classic.9 out of 10.","

This means that I was both too old (and too young) to have much interest in it, and I gave it a miss.I thereafter ended up spending a couple decades of my life living in a world surrounded by Toy Story stuff, but never having seen it or any of its sequels.It was only after growing up and having kids of my own that I finally got around to watching it, with them. And only then did I realize what an absolutely wonderful movie this was.The existing reviews already cover all the things that make it so good and I'm not sure I can add much too what has already been said. I will just say that I've watched it (and its sequels) several times now (at my kid's requests) and somehow it doesn't get old or tiresome with repeated viewing, for them or me. The story and the character's emotional pull is just incredibly resilient. It makes me laugh, it makes me cry. I don't know of any other movie series that has done that to me.","

While the groundbreaking CGI is impressive, the characters are what's so charming about the movie. It's a stroke of genius to make the movie about toys. The CGI is still not photo realistic. People would be too hard to make look real. Toys are perfect. And the great voices allow life to be injected into these inanimate toys. It works as a great story on its own, but it's the revolution in CGI that has changed entertainment. This wasn't just a simple step but a real game changer.","

Toy Story is a ... well story-fantasy that many kids have while they grow up. And to see that come to life (no pun intended), is just great.

"TOY STORY","classicsoncall","17 August 2011","With films like ""Toy Story"", I feel like I'm going out of my movie comfort zone somewhat, but then on the flip side, I think I'd like to be a kid forever. At least in spirit. You know, like the seniors in the old age home in the Twilight Zone episode 'Kick the Can'. There's a lot to like about this picture; part of it's the cool animation and creative voicing, part of it's the clever use of sight gags that young kids would have no idea about, like the Binford Tool Box and the Punisher logo on Sid's shirt. I guess it's good to be old enough to have that perspective.With only nominal appearances by the 'humans' in the movie, the picture stayed true to it's mission of presenting Andy's toys as if they were living and thinking creatures. They had their own favorites, showed emotion, and helped teach the lesson of having a friend by being a friend. When things looked bleak in Sid's back yard, the misfit toys even managed to violate their own prime directive, that is, they allowed Sid to see they were 'real' in order to help Woody and Buzz. I wonder if Sid ever got over it.I read a dozen or so of the other comments on the picture and no one mentioned Randy Newman in their reviews. I'm sure someone did, but let me add my voice to that minority. ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" is a perfect accompaniment to the picture, and fits it like a glove. Now that I see what I've missed with these animated films going back to ""Toy Story"", I'll have to hunt up a few more and kick that getting older can down the road a few more times.","

"TOY STORY","Tweekums","3 June 2009","While I don't think 3D computer animation has the charm of well made hand drawn 2D animation this film comes close due to the delightful characters and well thought out story.The story opens on the day of Andy's birthday party and his toys, led by Woody the cowboy are concerned about what presents he might receive, fearing he will get a toy that will supplant them in his affections. Of course he does get a shiny new toy, a Buzz Lightyear action figure. which is Andy's new favourite. Woody is upset about this and plots to get Buzz lost behind a dresser, unfortunately this goes wrong and Buzz is knocked out of the window. Since Andy can't find Buzz he picks up Woody when he is taken to ""Pizza Planet"". Outside Woody is finds Buzz but is soon separated from Andy. The two of them unite to try to get back to Andy but things take turn for the worse when they are ""captured"" by Andy's evil neighbour Sid, a horrid child who likes to destroy toys. Things go from bad to worse when Buzz learns that he is merely a toy and not the real Buzz Lightyear as featured on a TV show.Obviously this is a children's film but that doesn't mean adults can't enjoy it just as much, it is a great story that just happens to be about toys that come alive. The characters are all well designed and as a viewer I cared about what happened to them. This film is clearly destined to be a classic as it isn't bogged down with pop culture references which would cease to be funny in a few years. Whether you are four, forty or a hundred and four you should find this film to be lots of fun, I thoroughly recommend it.","

What a wonderful experience what with the funny moments as well as touching ones and some intense ones concerning that sadistic kid Sid. And the use of many established comic talents like Don Rickles, Annie Potts, John Ratzenberger (who would become a regular Pixar voice), the late Jim Varney, and especially, Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear. And as with previous Disney animated features, Randy Newman provides such an enjoyably compelling music score as well as several enjoyable songs with a great theme song in ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" that he warbled with Lyle Lovett. And the recent 3-D version just adds to the experience! So while this and Toy Story 2 is still (in its fourth week) playing as a double feature in theatres (with an entertaining 10-minute intermission of trivia and many other extras), I recommend you rush to the next showing as soon as you can!","

"TOY STORY","CinemaSerf","27 August 2023","Every now and again when you watch antiques programmes on television and somebody turns up with a toy in it's original box - that turns out to be worth more than his car - I regret that I no longer possess any from my childhood. I do recall, however, being especially fickle - the favourite one day was never likely to reign long before being supplanted by another. That's the case here for cowboy ""Woody"". He is the favourite of owner ""Andy"" amongst, it has to be said, rather a lot of different ones. Until, that is - one birthday, we meet Space Ranger ""Buzz Lightyear"". He's actually quite an affable chap, but the green eyed monster is now in charge and ""Woody"" tries to relegate his successor down the side of the bed. That goes wrong and, accidentally, out of the window he goes. The other toys are horrified, leaving ""Woody"" with no option but to get over his laser envy, rescue his new rival and repatriate him before the whole family move to a new home! What now ensues are some fun escapades, near misses and they fall into the hands of another young boy who really does want to blast ""Buzz"" into space. The vocal talents of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are enthusiastic and entertaining, those of Don Rickles (""Mr. Potato Head"") sometimes a little nearer the bone for the grown ups and they are all helped along by a good soundtrack and a wittily written script offering us plenty of scenarios that draw the viewer (of whatever age) into this simple, pretty timeless story. It's interesting, for 1995, to note the wide variety of toys this young boy has, too - no gender stereotyping, which is quite refreshing. This is quickly paced and enjoyable animation that touches on the values of trust, companionship and team spirt - as well as the demerits of envy and selfishness - and I really enjoyed it.","

The story is great, the characters are great, the voice talent is great, and the animation is great. Only the detail suffers by comparison with current computer animated films, but that is perhaps only to be expected.I was surprised and delighted to note Joss Whedon at the top of the list of those responsible for the screenplay - his name means a lot more to me now than it did 10 years ago.This 3D retooling is interesting. For one thing, it demonstrates that it is a relatively easy exercise for CGI animated features. Having said that, it doesn't add an awful lot to Toy Story. Given that the film wasn't envisaged as a 3D feature, there aren't any sequences specifically designed to showcase 3D. The climactic chase and rocket scene works well, and there are scattered moments which make you go, ""Oh, look!"" But nothing which makes you go ""Wow!"" In the way the trailer (created specially for this 3D version) did.But watching Toy Story, 2D or 3D, is never a waste of time - it's that good.","

It is a film for families that will appeal on different grounds depending on age. It regards a cowboy named Woody and the jealousy that erupts when Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear enters the room on their owner's birthday. Buzz is interesting because he doesn't realize that he is a toy. When Woody causes Buzz to fall out a window an adventure begins that eventually lands them both in nasty Sid's bedroom from next door where a dire fate awaits toys. Grand idea with imaginative filmmaking by director John Lasseter. Where the film goes wrong is its placing supporting characters as types with little purpose. The two leads carry the film with Tom Hanks voicing Woody who goes from important to jealousy to hero in an exciting climax. Tim Allen as Buzz brings much humour in his inability to accept what he is. There is a host of other toys that seem more like fillers. Don Rickles voices Mr. Potato Head and Wallace Shawn voices T-Rex. Jim Varney of Ernest P. Worrell fame voices the loyal Slinky Dog. It contains a theme of love and friendship and for adults it addresses the future of films. Grand achievement, or as the toys put it, ""To infinity and beyond!"" Score: 9 / 10","

Hanks and Allen both leave their marks on Woody and Buzz, respectively (it's part of the reason I was never able to buy Warburton's Buzz on the TV show, awesome though he is) and the rest of the cast all seem to fit perfectly.All of the funny lines came flooding back, and this rewatch was just a treat all around.

The only thing I wouldn't have known was the future story of Apple Inc.This is a wonderful one hour advertisement where you can see branded toys. The only thing that is original in this one hour waste is the way Steve Jobs' employees created a toy universe. It was so yesterday to create a new line of cheap plastics than do some silly adventure. It was called an adventure so people won't have any issue leaving the children alone for one or two hours of advertisements. It sounds so much more educative to have cartoon adventure instead of having cartoon characters selling you stuff. And, instead of a real actor, the cartoon has precisely zero morals: it can sell plutonium to a 5 year old or to some radical terrorist group without blinking. Unless the art director thinks the blink would raise the quantity at least 10 percent.Now about the creative part. Steve Jobs' employees never bothered to create something like say Hanna-Barbera. They just pushed older toys into this new advertisement. And here's where the creativity ends.What's even better is the world imagined. A world where children are isolated. Where they depend on their branded toys. And watch out for the bad kid! He is real creative. But the toys are working together to bring back what the lower case 'c' in a circle meant: a toy identical with million others on the shelves. Oh! And don't forget! A good kid would preserve all the junk: large useless wasteful boxes with advertisements for the whole line of plastic somethings.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch","

"TOY STORY","paulclaassen","3 February 2024","What do toys do when kids stop playing with them? Well, 'Toy Story' might provide some answers.As the title indicates - and as you'll see from the characters - 'Toy Story' is definitely more of a kids film. In every sense this is a beautifully animated cartoon kids will love watching over and over again. They will laugh at the antics the toys get up to, they will love the characters that might resemble some of the toys in their own room, and they will enjoy the story. It is a simple, easy to follow premise.Thanks to adding elements of danger and adventure, and themes adults can relate to, the film also has a mature appeal. Thus, 'Toy Story' is perfect for the entire family. But what is this story about? Andy is a young boy who lives in a nice neighbourhood and his favourite toy is a cowboy doll named Woody (who is wonderfully voiced by Tom Hanks). He has several other toys and when Andy is not around, they all come to life and have their own adventures.Then Andy gets a brand new, modern toy for his birthday: Buzz Lightyear - a space action figure. Buzz Lightyear soon becomes Andy's favourite toy, and this sparks jealousy in Woody. But when Woody accidentally knocks Buzz Lightyear out the window, it becomes Woody's mission to save him.There's plenty of action and adventure that follows and 'Toy Story' is sure to entertain kids (and adults!) from beginning to end.

I don't count him as villain he just likes to blow up objects that have faces on them.The characters, cast, concept and plot are perfect.Toy Story 2 is good-ok.
Toy Story 3 was a game changer
Toy Story 4 should not have been made.The Original Toy Story characters should have retired, and they should have done a soft reboot with new characters. Toy Story 4 with the original was not necessary and I never cared for it. No real and/or Childhood-fans care for Toy Story 4.Update on 4/3/20: I just seen toys story 4 and It was awesome.","

"TOY STORY","kevinlealcano","31 October 2021","Through animated toys, this movie will entertain kids and teach everyone about the importance of leaving behind favoritism. Accepting newcomers is part of life. Those who see themselves as the favorite ones for anyone, might end sharing the throne, or just leaving it.To kids those are just toys, but for parents those toys represent children. Like in the movie, favoritism can create jealousy and anger, and if as adults we do not change the way we teach our kids, non-expected things could easily happen to our children.Every toy and every kid is important and valuable.","

"TOY STORY","thesar-2","11 October 2009","I told a friend I was going to re-watch 'Toy Story' in the theater due to it being a ""classic"" in which he immediately disputed. I disagree. Much like 1977's 'Star Wars' or 'Citizen Kane,' 'Toy Story' was far before it's time and revolutionized it's genre, in this case: animation. In addition, they took it to the next level with creativity, a perfect combination of humor for both kids and adults as well as an excellent homage to toys people around my age grew up with. I was at the tail-end to some of the toys shown or in the middle when I was a child. So, of course, a great deal of smiles were on my face throughout in remembrance. But, as a movie-lover/amateur critic, it has to go beyond that. I won't like a movie without a great and original script/dialogue, deep characters, good pacing and surprises. This movie has them all. I loved the lines, the voices were pitch perfect, the adventure made up from just from imagination was inventive from minute one and all characters intersected beautifully. Just as child Andy's birthday party is to start, every toy (alive when no one else is around) is worried they'll be replaced and current head-toy cowboy Woody attempts to convince them otherwise. Unfortunately, it is he that's replaced by Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear (love the variances to his name, including ""Light-beer"") who seemingly doesn't know he is anything but an astronaut. Not too far deep into the story is a touching realization/awakening for both and great learning for the people watching, kids and adults alike. Excellent movie, perfect start for the apparently unbeatable Pixar studios and suitable for all ages. (Side note: 2009's 3-D version worth watching, but adds little to the already masterpiece it is.)","

"TOY STORY","eeg1587-184-998241","12 December 2014","Toy Story was the first fully animated movie that released in 1995. Starring Tom Hanks as Woody who brings life to the cowboy pull- string doll. Buzz Lightyear, played by Tim Allen brought the right attitude for the newest addition to Andy's (John Morris) toy collection. The story takes us back to the day where we played with toys and used our imaginations to create our own stories. When Andy would leave the room the toys would come to life. A week before Andy's birthday, with his family moving, he is given a party to spend with friends before they leave. The toys plot a way to discover Andy's new presents. After the party the other toys discovered Buzz is one of the presents Andy's receives before he leaves. The main theme of the story to me is ""friendship."" It's a great story relaying the message to be kind to everyone because you never really know when you might need them and your enemy could be your best friend in the end. After all, ""You've got a friend in me.""Woody doesn't want to lose top spot as favorite toy so he plots to get rid of Buzz. He starts with a master plan that leaves the both of them in a situation to help each other to get home. The rich colors and 3D animation gives the movie a more realistic feeling as if it were drawn. It is the lighting, modeling, computer graphics and animations are what bring this movie to life. The shading of certain objects, cracks or spills could be the difference between a human look or manufactured. The lighting had to be hard to create the film. They had some dramatic moody lights in Sid's room, flashlight stuff, daylight, bright sun for all sorts of different kinds of environments.When they add light it gives more a visual interest for viewers and hide some flaw in animation. Andy's room gives a sense of a happy, friendly and safe place because the brightness in the room gives that affect. This is an overall great film introducing a new way of animations!","

"TOY STORY","snoozejonc","20 February 2022","A child's favourite toy becomes jealous when a new toy arrives.'Toy Story' is Pixar's excellent first movie that showcases great comedy, imaginative storytelling and splendid animation.The concept of a toy universe was a fabulous idea and is the basis for so much of the narrative and comedy. In addition it presents wonderful characters voiced by stars like Tom Hanks and Tim Allen who made them household names.It is famous for being the first blockbuster movie to use 3D visuals and they still hold up strongly 27 years later. If you grew up on 2D animation as I did, this was a historic piece of art within the industry. I had mixed feelings at the time because I love the old way and Pixar rendered it more or less obsolete with this release.The sound effects and music play a huge part in the overall entertainment, with a classic Disney tune like 'You Got A Friend In Me' instantly recognisable.","

"TOY STORY","Rectangular_businessman","3 October 2010","Having recently seen the excellent Toy Story 3, I really wanted to go back and watch this film again. I haven't seen it in many years, but I remembered most of the scenes if not the exact detail and execution, and of course with an older eye I have a better appreciation for what's going on.This is just about as good of a ""first computer animated film"" as could be hoped for. One thing I can say is that the humor, while not sophisticated or adult, is more intelligent than I remembered. It's a movie designed for a young audience, but the writers realized that as many adults will be watching its debut for the spectacle of computer animation, and it's clever for this group in a way that would fly over their children's' heads.The plot line is simpler than I recalled, which is to be expected. One thing that surprised me is the relative one-dimensionality of the characters, especially when compared to Toy Story 2, which has been my mental standard for the characters for many years, and Toy Story 3. Woody is jealous but devoted, Buzz is delusional, Slinky is loyal, Mr. Potato Head is suspicious, etc. These aren't characters so much as they're adjectives. However, the voice actors do an all-around great job. I may just be saying that because I've known who Woody and Buzz are long before I knew who Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were. Ultimately, the simplicity of the characters matches the concise nature of the film.In fact, having watched this again the best way I can think of to describe this movie is that it's basically a really long short film. Which is not at all to say that its plot is artificially stretched; quite the contrary. It's lean and compact like a short film is, it just happens to not be short.All in all, watching this film again has lead me to believe that Toy Story 2 is underrated. Toy Story's sequel is understood by many to be an action-packed film appealing almost exclusively to kids, but that film was where some of the more mature themes that would be brought to their logical conclusion in Toy Story 3 first appeared. In addition, many of the characters, particularly Buzz, aren't nearly as fleshed out until the second one. Toy Story is a cartoon, but Toy Story 2 is an animated film, and that is the difference.That said, this movie holds up very well and I will always hold it close to my heart. There are rarely more joyous moments in film than ""falling with style.","

"TOY STORY","meydianarizki","29 October 2020","Y'know, I always suspected that my toys were coming to life when I wasn't looking!In Andy's Room, his toys lead lives of noisy desperation come every birthday and Christmas - no one wants to be one-upped by a new addition to the toy box. Nominally led by Cowboy Woody (there's a Brokeback joke in there just waiting to happen), Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Ham the piggybank, Bo Peep, Slinky the dog and a smattering of other playthings go about their toy business of playing checkers, hanging with the hometoys and ""plastic corrosion awareness meetings,"" until Andy's birthday party, when they gather expectantly around a transistor radio, listening to the reports of their toy soldier troops ""in the field"" (downstairs watching Andy's gift-opening), hoping that no gift will be exciting enough to cause Andy to neglect *them.* There is. His name is Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger.Directed by Pixar mainstay John Lasseter, with the voice talents of Tom Hanks (as Woody), Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger (forever Cliff from *Cheers*), R. Lee Ermey, Annie Potts, Jim Varney and Tim Allen (as Buzz), *Toy Story* is that *rara avis* that succeeds on all levels - in its animation, storyline, character development, its messages of friendship and self-realization and, most importantly, its entertainment value. The fact that this is a cartoon (or animated feature - just what DO we call this new wave of computer-generated movies?) is incidental. Which makes the slightly dodgy animation (of the ""real people"") irrelevant - it gets the point across with or without the technological finesse.The ""Disney Movie"" has become synonymous with maudlin messages, redneck fundamentalism, anachronistic family values, boneheaded parents, smart-mouthing youngsters, too-hip-to-be-smart teens and insufferable pets. Though Disney's tyrannical umbrella overarches this film's production studio, Pixar Animation, *Toy Story* somehow avoided all trace of Disney's craven hand, which is doubly surprising, considering this is Pixar's first feature length film, after years of experimentation. Right outa the gate and right outa the field.Sure, there are ""messages,"" but they are heartfelt, rather than maudlin (Woody tells Buzz during Buzz's greatest depression that it matters not what Buzz thinks of himself, what makes him important is what his owner, Andy, thinks of him); there are emotional segments, which are truly heartbreaking, rather than cheesy (when Buzz's escape attempt lands him with a broken arm, proving he is Not A Flying Toy, the lyric, ""Clearly I will go sailing no more,"" launches a thousand hankies); and the portrayal of Andy's family was Pixar's triumphal achievement. Boldly contravening Disney's *idée fixe* of the 1950's nuclear family and Norman Rockwell fantasies, one of the many incarnations of a modern-day family is presented: a single mother with two kids, who are neither geniuses nor monsters, just normal children; happy to visit Pizza Planet and disappointed when favorite toys are lost.Buzz - who believes he is a real life space ranger on a mission to save the universe - become Andy's favorite toy over Woody. The funny thing is: though Buzz believes he is real, he still adheres to toy protocol of ""playing inert"" when humans are in the area. (Maybe it's instinct?) When he mentions saving a toy from Sid, the vicious boy next door, how does he propose to do it if he is to adhere to the inert protocol? Buzz's ingenuousness regarding his role as a toy infuriates Woody to the point of attempted toy-assassination. Through a concatenation of accidents, both he and Buzz become lost and must use teamwork, trust and ingenuity to beat their path back to Andy, which finds them ensconced in scorchingly funny vignettes (Buzz fastening himself in an over-sized seatbelt; both falling in with green, three-eyed aliens; Buzz hyperventilating as ""Mrs. Nesbitt""). During a climactic rocket ride, the callback line, ""This is not flying - this is falling with style,"" simply seals this movie's greatness.At least I now have a plausible explanation as to why my toys always got lost: after going about their toy business, they would just go inert anywhere they happened to be, instead of paying attention to their master's infallible toy filing system.","

"TOY STORY","kyle-cruse","20 August 2008","Being a monumental achievement in modern film-making, ""Toy Story"" also proves to be the greatest family film I have ever seen. It is truly a brilliant concept. Young Andy's cowboy doll Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) becomes jealous when Andy starts paying more attention to his new space toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). Buzz, however, does not grasp the fact that he's actually a toy and thinks he is a space ranger here by mistake. Hanks and Allen are the perfect voices for these characters, as are Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, and numerous others. There are more great one-liners in this film than any other family film I can recall, one of the best being Buzz's ""I don't believe that man's ever been to medical school."" I have seen this film countless times, and it has become a true classic. It's masterfully done, not only being the first fully computer animated film, but also for it's superb writing and concept. Everything about the film, from the staff meeting scene in the beginning to Buzz seeing his TV ad, is perfectly done. Randy Newman's three original songs are all excellent. ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" lost to Pochahontas' ""Colors of the Wind,"" which I also love, but I'm not sure which was better; maybe this. Anyway, see this film. It's a treat to all ages.**** out of ****","

"TOY STORY","KineticSeoul","7 October 2009","I recently went to see the double feature which included ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2"" and I don't know if it's the nostalgia kicking in but it was still quite fun. I mean it wasn't good as when I first saw it when it came out when I was in elementary school, but it was still pretty entertaining and brought back some memories. The animation was amazing, and phenomenal when it first came out and still holds up today. The voice actors even did a great job, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen did a great job with there performance in portraying Woody and Buzz Lightyear. It was a exciting adventure, although the plot was simple it was effective and entertaining.The story is about toys coming to life, but keeping themselves secret by acting like they aren't alive. But the toys coexist with humans peacefully, except the toys in Andy's room get worried on birthdays and Christmases of being replaced. Thus when Andy's favorite toy get replaced by a new favorite toy, the conflict starts from there when the older toy that was Andy's favorite tries to hide the new toy, but ends up hitting it out the window. Although this day and age, kid's who are about Andy' age probably won't play with the types of toys portrayed in the movie, and the magic was sort of lost from when I saw it when I was in elementary. This movie is still ahead of it's time, by a large margin.8.5/10","

"TOY STORY","llltdesq","22 September 2015","This was Pixar's first feature-length film, the first full-length computer-animated feature film and the first film in the Toy Story series. There will be spoilers ahead: I could just say that this is a phenomenal film, a ground-breaking film and a must watch if you love film in general and/or animation in particular and leave it at that, but this comment would be rather thin if I did so, so I'll do a bit more here.I don't really need to discuss the plot, because, chances are, if you're reading this, you've probably seen this already. I'll do a brief sketch: this concerns a boy named Andy and his toys. Lifeless when humans are around, the toys come to life when none are in the room. Woody is the leader of the toys, but his place is threatened by a new toy, Buzz Lightyear. Andy and family are preparing to move. Through a series of mishaps, Woody and Buzz wind up being lost and must make their way back before the family leaves or be separated from Andy forever. After a series of adventures, they make it back and get on board before the family is gone.That's a simple story. The parts of the film are each so excellently crafted that it takes a simple story and creates gold. The animation still holds up, even after 20 years, which is an eternity in computer animation. The script is marvelous and the writers clearly show that they possess a love for both toys and film. The toys showing up in here are a mix of new (Woody and Buzz) and classic (Mr. Potatohead, Etch-a-Sketch and green army soldiers). There are gags referencing films as diverse as Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Wizard of Oz. Pixar also references the various shorts they'd made up to that point and TV shows like Star Trek and The Simpsons.The voice casting is spot on. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen nailed their parts. Don Rickles and Jim Varney were inspired casting choices and John Ratzenberger began an association with Pixar which continues today. The score and songs by Randy Newman are perfect, particularly the song, ""You've Got a Friend In Me"", which goes to the heart of the film. It's just an exceptional film.The attention to detail is incredible. Even minor characters turn out to have a significant influence on things, like the mutant toys in Sid's bedroom (Sid and his dog Scud are the villains here, Sid being a rather twisted kid next door). The look of everything is astonishing, though it has aged in 20 years.This film is available on DVD/Blu-Ray is is well worth getting. Most highly recommended.","

"TOY STORY","CinemaClown","7 October 2013","Making history at the rate of 24 frames per second throughout its 81 minutes of runtime, Pixar Animation Studios' feature film debut is one of the greatest filmmaking achievements that didn't just transform the entire animation industry with its groundbreaking computer animation but also set a whole new standard for its genre with its inventive storytelling, thus instantly cementing its place in the annals of cinema.The first fully computer-animated feature-length film in cinema history, Toy Story follows the adventures of a group of toys that belong to a young kid named Andy but mainly focuses on the relationship between Andy's long-time favourite toy Woody; a cowboy doll & his latest birthday gift that turns out to be Buzz Lightyear; an action figure who's unaware that he's a toy but nevertheless threatens Woody's long-held position.Directed by John Lasseter, Toy Story introduces its animation studio on a grand note for it brims with originality, creativity, imagination, passion & innovation from start to finish and marks the biggest leap for its medium since Walt Disney's Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs surfaced on the film canvas back in 1937. But what makes it one of the best animated films of all time is its seamless blend of sophisticated storytelling with state-of-the-art animation.The screenplay is a gem in itself too for the plot is tightly knitted, makes excellent use of wit & is inhabited by a colourful set of characters who exhibit a stunning level of depth in their respective arcs. Its make-believe world is extremely convincing, the references n homages it makes to earlier classics is tastefully carried out, the relationship between kids & their toys is nailed to perfection and it also manages to convey its themes with effortless finesse.Adding more heart n soul to its characters are the talented voices behind it spearheaded by Tom Hanks & Tim Allen who infuse life into Woody & Buzz Lightyear respectively plus their on-screen chemistry is absolutely fantastic. Cinematography is expertly carried out, pacing is very brisk for the film never loses momentum & keeps getting better as plot progresses while Randy Newman's music instills an immense feeling of joy, warmth & wonder with its adventurous tracks.And then of course there is the revolutionary 3D animation that marked the dawn of a new era in animation which soon went on to completely re-invent its medium. It may not look as spellbinding today as it did back in 1995 but its influence on film, technology, video games & even computer graphics ever since cannot be understated, nor can be denied the role it played in the rise of new animation studios which ultimately put its medium in the same league that other genres have enjoyed since long.On an overall scale, Toy Story is a magical blend of kinetic direction, smart screenplay, rich characters, ideal voice cast, dynamic camera-work, terrific editing & heartwarming score that's freshly envisioned, ingeniously composed & gorgeously animated. A masterwork of jaw-dropping quality refined to perfection that triumphs in all aspects, Toy Story marks a significant moment in cinema for it marks the arrival of what would later become arguably the most acclaimed as well as critically & commercially excelling film studio of our time.","

"TOY STORY","Robert_duder","4 July 2010","I think it is a pretty common conception that Toy Story revolutionized animation. Pixar's first release jump started the animation craze that has lasted nearly two decades and still going strong and gave birth to some of the biggest films of the last 15 years. So it should have been an easy choice for my 900th review with Toy Story craze back on with the new and equally as amazing third installment. Toy Story brings to life some of the greatest characters in film history. You will fall in love with all the characters within the first 15 minutes and makes every step of their fantastical adventure even more captivating. The adventure they go on when you look at it from a truth standpoint is no more than 'down the street' and back but when you're a 3-6 inch toy that changes everything and that is truly the brilliance of Toy Story. You will become one of these toys, their world is so real to you and you see everything from their perspective. Every single person on the planet had toys of one kind of another whether it be a stuffed teddy or a stick and watching Toy Story will make you fondly remember your childhood and look at every inanimate object we love in a different light.Tom Hanks is Woody. No one could ever take that away from him as is the case with many of the toys. Hanks is the soul of the good hearted, compassionate and brave toy cowboy. His voice is so incredibly animated and excited and just absolutely perfect. Tim Allen is as good as Hanks playing the role of everyone's favourite space toy Buzz Lightyear. The chemistry the film makers create between Buzz and Woody is phenomenal and probably one of the biggest reasons Toy Story remains so successful. If I could spend time on each and every voice actor in this film I would because this is without a doubt thee BEST voice acting cast in animation history. Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn (my personal favourite Rex), John Ratzenberger (simply amazing), and to a lesser extent but still amazing Annie Potts, John Morris (who was Andy in all three films spanning 15 years), Laurie Metcalf and the incredibly versatile character actor R. Lee Ermey. This entire cast created animation history. You will not find a better cast and considering they are all behind the scenes voicing fictional characters that is impressive.Director John Lasseter is not new to animation although Toy Story will certainly be considered his piece de resistance for certain. He has worked in various capacity on dozens of amazing Disney features but he obviously knows his characters, he obviously knows Disney and he obviously is in touch with the little child inside himself and all of us. Best of all Toy Story holds no punches. I would even hesitate to allow my young, young children to see the film before they were ready because there is truly some terrifying scenes in the film and some really creepy characters. Sid and his torturing of toys, and his rag tag band of creepy toy outcasts are downright creepy and make the story even more incredibly but could certainly creep out little children but the happy ending and the bright world of Andy's room and knowing that the Toys will win in the end brings everything together. If you hate cartoons, if you have never seen Toy Story you are short changing yourself because this film will make you realize animation is not your grand daddy's cartoons anymore. A brilliant amazing film that is probably one of the best ever made. 10/10 THANKS FOR STICKING WITH ME THROUGH 900 REVIEWS AND ON TO 1000!! 901 and 902 WILL BE TOY STORY 2 AND 3 RESPECTIVELY. Read on!!","

So their first film was of course Toy Story. Everyone has seen this movie before its probably the best Pixar movie to date since the mid 1990s. The story is about Woody the cowboy(voiced by Tom Hanks)who is a toy along with many other toys that come to life when no one is in the room. All of the toys are owned by Andy a young boy who lives with his mom and his sister. So on the eve of Andy's birthday he ends up getting a new toy,the Buzz Lightyear toy which is a very popular toy who is a space ranger. So when Woody is introduced to Buzz Lightyear(voiced by Tim Allen)Woody ends up being jealous of him and he would do anything to be the center of attention again. But when a rough kid who lives next door accidentally gets Woody and Buzz out of a cash rending machine its up to Woody and Buzz to escape Sid's house.Overall this was a very original authentic masterpiece. The story is very good,the music is great,the charcthers are engaging and the whole set up is fantastic. Its a shame it didn't win an Oscar but at least the 2010 prequel to it won Best Animated Feature beating the likes of Tangled and How To Train Your Dragon. 9/10","

It is complete harmless fun from start to finish, as we follow a group of toys that come to life when the owners are not around.

It is clear that Pixar tried very hard to ensure this would be a movie that the entire family, people of all ages, can watch and enjoy.The cast is phenomenal, Tom Hanks shines as Woody and truly embodies the emotions the character is undergoing. Tim Allen is also terrific as Buzz Lightyear and conveys the characters realisation of his reality brilliantly throughout, other highlights for me would be Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head and John Ratzenberger as Hamm. It is a feel good movie and you will find it hard not to wipe the smile off your face from start to finish. Funny, sweet and well animated, Toy Story is fun for the whole family.

Woody's attempts to get rid of Buzz spiral out of hand and things get quite emotional and dramatic.","

"TOY STORY","The-Sarkologist","17 March 2021","I guess it was time to watch another film that I had seen quite a while ago and hadn't really been all that interested in of late. I guess the reason is that I generally don't like animated features all that much, but I had a choice to make, and I decided that I'd choose this film. Well, I'm sort of glad that I did. Okay, it is your basic Disney film so you can pretty much get an idea of what it is about. It is also apparently one of the first entirely computer animated films that was produced, so it was breaking ground back in the day (though these days it is pretty common place).I'm sure we all know the story though - it is about the relationship between Woody, the cowboy toy who was Andy's favourite toy, and that is until he received Buzz Lightyear for a birthday present, and suddenly Woody discovers that he has become a has been. In fact, Woody's pride of place on the bed is suddenly replaced by Buzz Lightyear. Anyway, both of them end up getting lost, and they have to make their way back to Andy before they move off across the country (and of course Woody is blamed for Buzz Lightyear becoming lost).While this is a kids film, there is a lot that can resonate to us as adults, and that is the fear of becoming obsolete. Sure, the film does have a happy ending, but the thing is that many of us adults live with that fear of one day becoming obsolete, and it doesn't matter how wealthy you are because, well, something could happen and you suddenly discover that you are no longer relevant - just ask Blockbuster Video.In a way we spend our entire lives trying to remain relevant only to discover that there is little we can do to maintain that. This is a fear that all of the toys experience every birthday and Christmas, as they attempt to listen in to the present opening ceremony to find out if they will still be relevant afterwards. Unfortunately for Woody, who is the favourite toy, this position is a position that is very precarious, as I suspect that there are a lot of toys in the box that were once in that position, and have suddenly found themselves being replaced.The problem with these happy ending films is that it suggests that things will eventually work out, but remaining relevant is a life long effort, and requires you to make some serious decisions down the track. Unfortunately there are no hard and fast answers to this problem, and the movie doesn't provide one either, however it does make us think, and those of us who believe that we are indispensable need to re-evaluate that position.","

Woody is the toy cowboy doll of a boy called Andy. Woody is Andys favorite toy until one day Andys birthday comes around and he gets a new toy which quickly becomes Andys favourite toy ahead of Woody. Woody quickly becomes jealous because not only has Andy pushed him aside but his fellow toy friends have chosen the new toy Buzz Lightyear ahead of Woody so now Woody plots a way to get Buzz out of the way for good with disastrous consequences. I will say no more about the movie as i feel if you haven't seen it then most of this film should be a surprise to you. All i do have to say however is Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz are superb choices as the voices of the main characters.

"TOY STORY","sol-","17 February 2017","In a world in which toys talk and move whenever humans are not looking, a cowboy doll experiences jealousy for the very first time after an action figure replaces him as his owner's favourite toy in this popular animated comedy. The premise lends itself to a number of perplexing unanswered questions (in particular, regarding the 'rules' that the toys follow to freeze as soon as there is the possibility of a human seeing them move) but if one accepts the basic notion and runs with it, the film offers a surprisingly compelling story with striking personal identity themes as both of the main toys come to realise that they are not as special as they once thought. For Woody, it comes with realising that his owner can have other favourite toys and for Buzz it comes from awakening to the fact that he actually is a toy and not the famous space commander that he is designed as being. The film is blessed by excellent animation effects too; while many entirely computer generated animated films have come out in the years since, few have used the process quite so delightfully with lots of mobile tracking and panning shots that would have been near impossible to get right in a live action feature. The changing facial reactions on the toys (especially Woody) are impressive too - even if the fact that the toys in the film look more realistic than the humans in the film never quite feels right. This is, of course, a film about the toys though, and fanciful as the premise may well be, there is a lot to like about their loyalty both towards their owners and each other.","

It is absolutely extremely clever to say the least, and the well-rounded cast only elevates it.The animation is top notch, and though it would be improved later on obviously, it's still incredibly sharp.The script is brilliant, showcasing lots of incredibly well written drama and comedy.

"TOY STORY","johnnyboyz","16 July 2010","Amongst a lot of other things, 1995's Toy Story is a mixing of basic filmic conventions in the form of character arcs and genre demands blended with highly effective comedic content, all combined with a high concept into a piece thoroughly enjoyable and worthwhile. Its energy unmistakable; its inspiration unequalled and its charm unmatched, in what is a milestone in animation for reasons much more than the fact the computer generated imagery was as fresh as it was. Vaugely, the memory of seeing it for the first time many years ago stands in rather stark comparison to whatever I recall of the rest of that viewing when it was revealed Toy Story was to be, quite literally, about the toys and their coming to life so as to interact and engage with their surroundings. In starting in the manner it does, with a young boy named Andy animating his toys to as to bring them to life and interact with what's around them as it ran on whatever meek story he could come up with and not knowing a thing about the premise or indeed content, ignorantly, I led myself into believing the entire piece would be of this ilk; quite literally, a toy story about toys being what they are: inanimate objects being interacted with by a child. Imagine the sense of surprise mixed with awe and glee when Woody sits up in Andy's room and announces that ""the coast is clear!"" to the rest of the toys.The film starts like one of those short cartoons you'd see before the beginning of a feature film, years ago. The opening is a diverting mini-narrative involving each of the main characters going through whatever motions a child can muster; the lead toy of whom is Woody (Hanks), a cowboy doll which is promptly taken downstairs and around the house as it's emphasised he is Andy's favourite, and has been for a while. I suppose what happens when they come alive might be read into as a deconstruction of these toys; that they are, indeed, so much more than just inanimate objects whom don't think nor feel, each of them coming alive once the humans have vacated then operating within said space; maintaining relationships and feeling an array of emotions such as fear, angst and lust. Some are friendlier than others; some more confident and some have certain elevated relationships with each other. Amongst them, Don Rickles' Potato Head doll; a wonderful creation of physical comedy whose detachable body parts are the source of persistently funny jokes. He's joined by a Slinky Dog (Varney); a green plastic dinosaur Rex (Shawn) and, curiously, Andy's piggy bank Hamm (Ratzenberger).Interestingly, Andy's toys seem infused by true-to-life western iconographic imagery, or are indeed representative of 'type' in their attitudes. Rex is a dinosaur, thus feels the need to be able to scare people with his 'roar' for reasons that must be linked to the fact T-Rex dinosaurs from billions of years ago did exactly this. Somehow, Rex is aware of this. Likewise Andy's small toy soldiers, led by a sergeant voiced by R. Lee Ermey, are as militarian as you'd expect but is there a written rule that says they must show expertise in special ops and must behave in the military manner they do? Remember those grey plastic soldiers of similar size you could get? I guess they'd be equally militarily efficient but could speak in a German accent. I had some yellow soldiers of similar size once; God only knows how they'd sound. There can be no surprise that the toys of Syd (von Detten) cannot speak, due to their forced hybridising with other toys under said child's tortuous regime which sees heads and bodies swapped with other toys thus falsifying their image.It can be no coincidence the two principal toy characters of the film are the two that most resemble human beings in their appearance, with Andy's other toys marginalised due to their animistic or unnatural characteristics. Woody's perfect existence is thrown into disarray by Buzz Lightyear (Allen), a spaceman toy Andy gets on his birthday; the revealing of the gift at the end of the present opening session starting this huge build up as to what Buzz is. Buzz's presence is an example of an item of a more futuristic; more science-fiction orientated nature coming into the house and taking over as older items are rendered more obsolete and therefore replaced thus rendering the issue one of a modernity driven nature, and is an item Toy Story 2 explored much more broadly in terms of genre replacing genre when toys of Woody's ilk are rendered nothing but mere museum pieces. But it is additionally representative of America's obsession with consumerism, in that I've no doubt Buzz is a part of a kind of franchise and Andy's gradual replacing of Woody posters/merchandise etc. This, as he and his mother occupy this blissfully suburban infused street which is systematic of the nation's own attitudes towards mass produced products.Woody and Buzz's overall ultimatum is issued to us, out loud, by Woody when they are stranded at a petrol station: Andy's due to move house shortly and both need to get home, so a lot is at stake and tension runs persistently high. Buzz's own tale of realisation is effortlessly inter-cut with this plight, along the way learning of a new existence and garnering a new lease of life as their relationship feeds off a rather Hollywoodised 'buddy' combination no doubt inspired by American films of the 1980s through to the early 1990s of this ilk. Apart from pioneering your now token 'chase' finale, of which encompasses all the elements and is seen nearer the end of mostly every CG animated film made since (see 2002's Monsters Inc. or 2009's Up), Toy Story is a wonderfully made, supremely nourishing film that opens our eyes to a whole new world within our own and enthrals and entertains in equal measure.","

"TOY STORY","Movie_Muse_Reviews","15 November 2018","""Toy Story"" came out when I was in third grade and it remains the most revolutionary film of my lifetime. Outside of Pixar's offices, who would've predicted that in 1995, at the at the height of Disney's 2D animated musical resurgence, that the course of animated family films had just been changed forever.And it wasn't just the technology. ""Toy Story"" undoubtedly deserves to be heralded until the end of time for being the first computer-animated feature film, but so many other forces contributed to it becoming the year's box-office champion, chief among them - story.Pixar's first concept exemplifies all the incredible storytelling they've done in the last 20-plus years: What do our toys do when no one is watching? Children's imaginations have infused their toys with life ever since there were toys, and ""Toy Story"" plays out that fantasy for kids while evoking profound nostalgia for the parents.This ""hidden world"" notion, with stories that explore little universes hiding in plain sight, has been Pixar's secret story sauce. Just take a look at the movie's credits to see how that concept influenced future classics: Pixar father (and the film's director) John Lasseter (""A Bug's Life,"" ""Cars""), Pete Docter (""Monsters Inc.,"" ""Up,"" ""Inside Out"") and Andrew Stanton (""Finding Nemo,"" ""WALL-E"").But even a brilliant concept needs anchoring in real, universal human themes, and that's the real reason Pixar has been the cream of the crop ever since November 22, 1995. In ""Toy Story,"" that boils down to the characters of Woody and Buzz. There's Woody, who has the whole being a toy thing figured out and enjoys his cozy little ""spot"" as Andy's favorite. Then there's Buzz Lightyear, the shiny new novelty who hasn't had the existential realization that he's not a space ranger yet. It's a storyline for these two leads born out of something that happens all the time: kids' tastes change and they're always moving on to the next cool toy. Woody's jealousy and Buzz's naivete are relatable to kids and adults alike.That takes us to the crowning touch on ""Toy Story"" - the voice acting (no, not Randy Newman, but he's crucial to the film's complete aesthetic). Only with the casting of Robin Williams as the Genie in ""Aladdin"" a couple years earlier had there even existed the notion of casting big-name actors in animated films. Even then, like Williams, the name parts were given to comedians in the comic relief roles. Getting Tom Hanks to play the lead role was a total coup, and when ""Toy Story"" made bank, animation studios immediately began putting together cast lists of name actors that could barely fit on a movie poster.Hanks' Woody still deserves to rank as one of the best voice-acting performances. He's the emotional signpost keeping young viewers in tune with how they should feel at each moment (though Buzz's botched flight attempt is the emotional apex of the movie to be sure). Hanks isn't merely lending his voice to the film, he's playing the role of Woody, and it makes all the difference.During my many childhood viewings, ""Toy Story"" always felt like an exhaustive multi-chapter journey, especially once Woody and Buzz leave the confines of Andy's room, so on this revisit it's funny to realize that the film remains Pixar's shortest. That's how much dimension Lasseter and team pack into this movie and a large part of why it endures. Any notion that ""Toy Story"" was a ""cute"" first attempt by a studio that would go on to vastly improve upon it is missing the point. Yes, Pixar would get more visually advanced, build even more intricate worlds and tell even more emotionally deeper stories (and all in the ""Toy Story"" series alone), but all those elements in this film still stand strong on their own. It's a classic, and one that set the bar upon which all those films were left with no choice but to strive for.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more","

"TOY STORY","BooChanan","27 August 2012","Toy Story was PIXAR's first full-length movie and is still today regarded as one of their best along with the two sequels. The movie is about toys coming to life when the children aren't around. The movie shows how every toy wants to be loved. The main character, Woody (a cowboy), is the most loved toy in Andy's house until another toy, Buzz Light (space ranger), is bought. The story is about their jealousy and friendship; which is portrayed brilliantly in the plot which is aided by an amazing Randy Newman soundtrack. The movie is clever, funny, sad and beautiful in the way that it engrosses all age groups. It was a milestone in animation with its stunning 3-D graphics. I strongly recommend this movie to anybody who hasn't seen it. It is one of PIXAR's and Disney's greatest movies ever and is very worthy of a 10 out of 10.","

"TOY STORY","fernandoschiavi","10 May 2021","There are films that represent a milestone in their genre, be it for innovation in language, in its structure or even technologically. There is no way we cannot mention the magic made by 3D artists without including Toy Story. Animation is many things, for many people, times and contexts. Launched in 1995, this production became, for example, the first fully animated by computer.Rather than trying to amaze your audience with just its innovative look - for the time - ""Toy Story"" focuses on winning the audience over its characters. Let us start with its protagonists. Despite looking like just another good-natured character at first, Woody becomes increasingly complex as the film goes on, feeling not only jealous of Buzz, but also with a real fear of being left out by the one he saw as his most loyal companion. A scene that marks in a very simple but effective way, this affection is immediately in the opening credits, when Woody ""falls"" beside Andy on the sofa. In this first film, Woody is a character with a rather complicated bow, who could easily transform the wooden cowboy into a figure that children would be disgusted by because of their attitudes. Thanks to the sensitivity of the filmmakers, we understand his actions and accompany his emotional growth.Buzz, on the other hand, suffers from a problem that prevents him from determining within his reality. Believing himself to be a space hero, his naiveté and innocence in his belief manage to maximize the anger that Woody feels when he sees the astronaut so casually stealing an affection that he so cherished. Like Woody, Buzz ""loses"" something in the course of the film, a loss perhaps deeper than that of the sheriff. There is still a historical element in the relationship of the two, after all it is a fact that in the American children's imagination, there was really a replacement of cowboys by astronauts, during the space race.The supporting actors also steal the show, all with very striking personalities and visuals. The acid Mr. Potato Head is the highlight of this troupe, simply priceless, always with a sarcastic comment at the tip of his non-existent language. The neurotic dinosaur Rex also gets a good laugh. The Slinky spring dog and Pig work very well as ""stairs"", with their interaction together being excellent, while Sergeant and his soldiers play a small, but anthological, action scene. It is also impossible not to mention the disfigured toys in Sid's room, which have a great participation and a very interesting look. As a matter of fact, the little villain and his kind sister Hannah end up being the best-developed human characters in history, especially Sid. It is funny that the audience can barely get to know Andy, but that he gets so much into the crazy psyche of the young pyromaniac.The merits of the film directed by John Lasseter are many. In addition to being a beautiful work (debut of the partnership between Disney and Pixar), with a well-designed script, charismatic characters and adventure in the right measure, it opened doors to several other good productions. If it weren't for Woody and Buzz, we might not have seen (the way they got to our eyes, at least) Antz (1998), Shrek (2001), Finding Nemo (2003) and Ratatouille (2007), among so many others. In addition to the impressive look for the time, what draws the most attention in Toy Story is its plot. Creative and with deep characters, the animation has a story that manages to please children and still interest adults. In fact, this is a characteristic of the vast majority of animations in recent years. This concern with the non-child audience ended up raising the challenge for the screenwriters and turned the stories into a program for the whole family. The feature film directed by John Lasseter is one of the pioneers in this regard.It was essential, therefore, the feature film to be made on computers. Far from these machines being lifeless - as toys are not - there was, however, a lot of passion in the will of Pixar Animation Studios' artists to become pioneers. This is an achievement, consequently, that not only enhances Toy Story in a technical sense, already deserving of awards. On the other hand, the technological revolution in question also magnified animation in other terms: as in the realization of its creation of a world, in itself new, which would originate a sentimental approach between cinema and the public. The enchantment, in turn, does not lie only in the ""superficial"" novelty, because there is value in the content and in an integration between technology and narrative. In terms of deepening a sense of love for all the children who watched the animation, Toy Story fulfills, in this case, an instigating creative proposal - which, by the way, is very original, inviting. The script is concerned, moreover, with using the magical premise not only as a pretext, but as part of a study. It is important for Toy Story, therefore, to understand who these toys are and what their real goals are in the world.The script, moreover, wears patience by not exposing the premise face-to-face, building patiently the mystique and understanding of the dramas that are at stake and that serve a discursive purpose: a creation of a fictional world that resignifies real relationships. This whole ensemble enriches the imaginative sense and the affection of the spectator-children for their dolls and dolls, as well as investing the attention of the animators in a universe that has many layers of verisimilitude. It may even be that part of the target audience does not have many friendships in their daily lives, however, it certainly does in their rooms. Woody's (Tom Hanks) journey, in this case, basically covers his jealousy with the arrival of Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a toy astronaut who believes he is a real space explorer, but who gets to be played more often by Andy, the owner of both characters. The two are lost and need to return before the boy moves.In the midst of existentialist crises, the protagonists enter trajectories that progressively intensify the love that is at stake. Certain songs, in fact, complement the dramas of the characters. The soundtrack by Randy Newman, who introduced us to classics like ""You've Got a Friend in Me"". Music is crucial in establishing unconditional love between toys and owners. ""Strange Things"" and ""I Will Go Sailing No More"" are striking in this sense. Buzz, in his instance, is about to perceive himself as a fraud, until his mission takes on other meanings, no longer being to protect the galaxies, but to protect the heart of a mere boy. Woody, on the other hand, even without Andy playing with him, needs to be at his disposal when the boy needs it. This magical idea of love above all is very rewarding to the public, although open to some questioning, as it supports a little slave-like thinking. But even so, the argument manages to find a resolution, bringing the antagonist Sid (Erik von Detten) to oppose Andy as a child and, ultimately, to suffer the consequences of his behavior. The moralism builds an imaginary that is powerful enough to impact, without having to be expository or pedagogical. As a promise of an eternal friendship, Toy Story transposes cinematic walls to embrace us, talking to us personally.And like any game, the animation would need to be imaginative, it would need to entertain and also conquer. Of the most exciting adventures that animated cinema has ever presented, Toy Story is, above all, a good story. The necessary events occupy the short duration of the film very quickly, however, never seeming rushed or needing silly solutions to find conclusions. The confrontations that emerge in the course of the narrative sound natural, like Buzz ignoring Woody's calls to enter a spaceship and then be captured by Sid. There is a lot of intelligence in the way the script takes advantage of the dramas, like the enmity that Andy's other toys take from Woody, to rearrange specific scenes. Various possibilities of solutions are emerging for the characters, bringing them closer to their objectives, however, recurrently, a new problem appears to be a barrier to the anticipated success of the mission. When the cowboy is just a window away from his owner's room, for example, a twist in the plot of Buzz Lightyear prevents him from being rescued. The linked events, therefore, exemplify excellent precision in cohesion.The animation, taking into account that it is a film released in 1995, is quite fluid, especially in the action sequences. An absolute highlight in this regard is the climax of the film, with Woody and Buzz racing to reach Andy's moving truck.Certainly, the film does not have the emotional nuances that its sequences would present, but it is extremely rich in establishing the public's empathy with such characters, so that this future becomes a possibility. Each of the supporting actors - who would gain more presence in the narrative at other times - traces a particular personality. Each staff occupies a space in the imaginary. Iconographical, an animation is created that takes from the public's nostalgia with the toys of his past - or those of the present - to recreate his own. The premise is somewhat simple, however, the reinventions in the journey show a creative care that deservedly earned animation an Oscar nomination for Original Screenplay. A technological experiment, a cinematic revolution, an intimate achievement. Toy Story takes on several meanings over the years, however, in the end, the most important thing even lives in the connection that the work establishes with its audience.","

While the animation is groundbreaking to say the least, it doesn't mean that it has a story to back it up.  I for one love cartoon movies, but this left a sour taste in  my mouth.  Maybe it's because in what is supposed to be a kids' movie, we see one character trying to ""off"" another character, out of pure jealousy.  The other toys were just annoying as the chorus, as they, like the leads, had a total lack of any real character.  There were some bad attempts at humor that didn't even win a giggle out of me or my family.Skip it and see Shrek or Ice Age.  Better stories to balance the animation.","

But as much as I enjoy the craft and history of Toy Story, I also think it deserves credit for its influence. It's just too bad that all the filmmakers that think they're working from the Toy Story template are missing the main ingredient: story. Pixar worked and reworked this script for years and refused to quit until they got it right. Woody and Buzz, Pizza Planet, Andy's Bedroom, Sid--I only wish I had appreciated it for what it was upon its release. But I get it now. And I will be there for whatever this company does next.","

I still love it five years after seeing it in the theatres.Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are well-cast as Woody and Buzz Lightyear respectively, and a stellar voice cast includes Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger, and Jim Varney. The story follows the plights of Woody, who becomes jealous of Buzz, who seemingly becomes their kid owner's new favorite toy.

"TOY STORY","questl-18592","28 September 2019","It's amazing how this movie has changed over the years. How the once amazing graphics have aged and really don't hold up is the obvious thing but there's more than that.When I was younger, Sid was just the monster next door but watching it now I can't help but notice how the movie is (inadvertently) commenting on the impact parents have on their children. Andy's mom always being there, loving and supporting while Sid is literally blowing things up and his dad just sleeps in his recliner in a tucked away room.Then there's Woody, the cowboy that made us all fall in love with Pixar. To see him now... Woody is a jerk. He's self involved, selfish and even violent all because he's no longer the favorite.But that is the brilliance of Pixar. 19 years later, the visuals may have waned but the story complexities have matured like a fine wine proving that they have always understood how to make movies for children and adults alike.","

"TOY STORY","Mysterygeneration","13 June 2022","The first computer-animated picture, ""Toy Story,"" achieves a liberating and new three-dimensional reality and freedom of movement. The film doesn't only animate actors against painted backdrops; it fully animates them and allows the viewer to freely navigate around them.It took 800,000 hours of computer time to create Toy Story. Each frame requires up to 300 megabytes of data.John Lasseter and his team bring Woody, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, and Bo Peep to life. When their owner is not present, the toys come to life. Woody sends all of the troops downstairs in a Bucket of Soldiers to keep an eye on what's going on. ""Toy Story"" lacks the plot ingenuity and wit of ""Rabbit"" or other Disney animated features like ""Beauty and the Beast."" Its greatest pleasures are just for the eyes, but what delights they are!","

"TOY STORY","charliejennifercheng","19 September 2014","Eventually Toy Story was everything of my childhood,from the imagination and the belief that the toys would come to life,to the tongue in cheek script that get me laughing a lot,the story that makes me think and value till today on how a great story can make a huge impact to people and the likable characters that I grew up loving and having these toys as those played in my childhood.Its animation,though it was made at that time when CGI animation was just starting,or they did started the whole thing was top notch till today when I watched it in Hi Def.As it was always,it was the everything that a great movie could offer. We started with a simple yet powerful plot about a toy cowboy doll who is on top of his game,admiration and respect from his fellow toys as well as the unconditional love he has from his owner,Andy.However this has changed,only for temporary when his owner brought in a new toy that he had just got as a birthday present,a space superhero action figure and due to his arrival ,the space superhero did got every thing of admiration and love that the cowboy once have that the cowboy was always sidelined from everything.This thus turned into an outrage of jealousy that the cowboy and the space superhero ended up getting into a conflict so severe that he got pushed out of the window so that his beloved owner would not find him,however it was lucky that the space superhero survived and thus another fight occurs this time in the petrol station.They then went onto a pizza delivery truck where their owner was there and ended up again being held captive by a cruel,yet troubled neighbor named Sid who just loves to torture toys every day.And together as they were held captive,they then have to come in terms to work together in order to save themselves from the captive they were in and also to get back to their owner who they then realized have love them unconditionally,Andy which is by far one of the most realistic plot I've ever come across,though it is viewed in a toy's perspective. The movie themes itself was also powerful itself.Though it is a kids movie,it deals with themes of jealousy,abduction,cruelty and suicide as well of positive themes of leadership,cooperation,love and friendship.It is a movie that plays well with every theme so well that it deserves to be praised to its highest point.It was a movie of all genre,from horror to action to comedy and to being inspirational at all claims which most movies did not have these days.Today,we do have the various types of CGI animated movies,from the ultra good (The Incredibles,How To Train Your Dragon,Monsters Inc) to the mediocre(Rise of The Guardians,Cars,Over The Hedge,Wreck It Ralph) the ultra bad( Frozen,Brave,Turbo,Antz,Chicken Little,Shark Tale ),but none can ever come to the touch of magic that Toy Story did left in many people's hearts.Also Toy Story is also the biggest reason to every animation student on why they wanted to study animation especially 3D at the first place.Without Toy Story we would not even think that taking a leap to animation would be really very possible for many aspiring animators and film directors of that line.Overall,Toy Story,which is honesty the first animated film that I grew up watching in my life(I was four a that time), was the first that I grew up loving everything from the movie.It it quite strange that it is only later that I've realized that this hugely influential movie was released at the same year that I was born,1995 which has then installed the love of animation towards me and my whole life.And it is when I've watched this movie is that I've decided on what I've wanted to do entirely ,directing an animated movie that is as groundbreaking as Toy Story. Overall,in my personal words,it is very tough to pen a review on a movie that you've loved so much in your life and has made a great impact on your career path.Personally ,Toy Story is an amazing film that was not over-hyped,but rather talked due to its legacy and greatness from everything it has,thus it should be remembered by many generations to come.Finally,I would like to thank John Lasseter,Ed Catmull and also whoever who has been involved in the production of this wonderful movie for opening the doors to many aspiring animators out there that anyone can live the legacy that Walt Disney did formerly","

Certainly this is one of Pixar's greatest films, and thusly, given Pixar make the greatest animated masterpieces it should be scoring far higher, there are no issues with this film. The voice acting is on point, the plot is solid, for the time it was the most innovative film in a very very long time, and began an era of animation that continues to this very day, over a quarter of a century later.

"TOY STORY","Spondonman","28 December 2010","I've finally watched the 3 (so far) excellent Toy Story Pixar Disney films after hearing Mark Kermode recommend them on UK BBC as the BEST trilogy ever made, including the Godfathers. Well, who am I to argue with such a cinema expert? But he obviously doesn't remember the dashing Dick Barton!#1 has the main toy characters of Woody and Buzz overcoming impossible odds to escape from the clutches of psychotic child toy killer Sid, #2 Woody from the clutches of psychotic toy collector Al, #3 Buzz and the gang from the clutches of psychotic toy Lotso. Throughout the individual films and the series as a continuous whole the characters, the character development, the cgi cartoonery, the comedy and the story are uniformly elegant and almost perfect. This is fast paced logically progressed stuff for kids to enjoy and adults to appreciate, and hopefully most of the relational morals will be taken on board by most people – apart from whether or not it's OK for someone to be portrayed as owning apparently live human beings and using them as toys of course! Do you empathise more with Andy the caring Owner or Woody the faithful Slave, or neither like me?A personal yardstick I use for cartoons is Does the film look like the people who made the film had fun making it? With Toy Story 123 the answer is a resounding Yes – they were so full of fun and confident that even a cod Spanish reprise of Randy Newman's main song was included in 3. And that came after some surprising scenes of heartbreaking poignancy – containing Tom Hanks' finest ever performance. In an ever more populated genre getting ever more technologically advanced and intelligent this series remains magically simple, and simply the best of its kind. Great fun and very re-watchable.","

The music in the film is great and fits very well whatever see going on in the different scenes. The whole idea of the toys having to keep their lives a secret from the humans was very clever too. The film is just a brilliant tale of jealousy, lost identity and friendship, huge themes for a kids film but it's all pulled off with such skill. A brilliant movie.","

"TOY STORY","Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","18 January 2020","Toy Story became one of 1995's surprise hits after a troubled production that saw Woody's character go through a complete overhaul: he went from being a controlling jerk (there's a Black Friday Reel on YouTube that shows what could have been) to a wise leader who watches out for his friends and only gets shaken up when a new toy, Buzz Lightyear, is changing his world that shakes his place and stability amongst Andy's collection of toys. It's a simple story of protagonist-confronted-by-inciting-incident 'stuff' but this simplicity and true-to-their-heart cast of characters makes Toy Story such a great film that takes full advantage of its creative and multi-layered world.It's one of the world's defining animated movies thanks to its full-circle screenplay and top-notch character development never being squandered during the film's (admittedly) short runtime of 81 minutes. That doesn't even matter anyway: Toy Story is one of those landmark movies people will never get tired or revisiting over the years. It's just a pure joy to watch and rewatch.Toy Story gets 5/5 stars.","

"TOY STORY","Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","29 November 2018","Having recently viewed the Toy Story 4 teaser on YouTube, I felt the need to revisit these movies. I can honestly say that Toy Story is as important to animated cinema as Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in that both movies were the first feature length animated productions ever done in their respective mediums: Toy Story being the first computer-animated feature and Snow White being the world's first traditionally-animated feature.Toy Story is as synonymous with cinema as the works of Francis Ford Coppola, Stanley Kubrick, Hayao Miyazaki and Chuck Jones: it's a film that shows the best of every world in the imagination. There are toys that embody cowboys, spacemen, wrestlers, dogs, potatoes and figures that resemble the uber-edginess the mid-90s garnered thanks to hit video games like Doom and Mortal Kombat. Toy Story is a film that knows exactly what makes kids movies resonate with adults: having an emotional bridge that's built into the story itself where playtime and wisdom, as the fundamental themes to the film, is symbolic of the concept of people growing up and how that can change the world around you. You can still mature in ways that still keep you young and hopeful at heart even when everything around you is totally unpredictable and volatile.This film is a zeitgeist movie for the 90s and it's still technically very impressive to this very day. I'm struggling to find faults with this movie: it's one of those special movies that you can watch repeatedly and still find something new every time you watch it again.Toy Story is a 5/5 star masterpiece.","

"TOY STORY","Tornado_Sam","26 June 2019","While in general I tend to go for the classic animation style as opposed to all the fancy CGI stuff that goes on nowadays, you have to admit: These Disney-Pixar features are really quite entertaining. While this 3-d animation style has been overused a lot over the past decade, the films are admittedly fun, creative, and suspenseful; they are movies for all ages; and they are, furthermore, among the best and most harmless children's classics to be found today (set aside the upcoming ""Frozen II"").""Toy Story"" was, from what I gather, Pixar's first film and also the world's first CGI feature length movie. It plays upon an old, used but still timeless concept: that of toys and inanimate objects coming to life whilst the owners are away. In ""Toy Story"", the main characters are toy cowboy named Woody and toy space ranger Buzz Lightyear. (Call me crazy, but I am not familiar with either and still enjoyed it; you do not need to understand whom the toys are based upon to like it). Woody is the leader of all the toys in Andy's room, where they are played with every day. In their spare time, they come to life to have their own fun, and Woody (being the favorite) enjoys being in charge. Until Buzz shows up on Andy's birthday, and becomes the new favorite with all his fancy gear, 'lasers' and such. The two are soon in competition, which results in both ending up outside their house where a dangerous and ridiculously crazy adventure awaits.That being the basic synopsis, you can tell that in terms of storyline the movie is very simplistic. Yet it doesn't need a complex and overblown plot to be fun (although the ridiculously absurd ending is admittedly overdone) and in terms of intrigue and comedy it does a pretty good job. The characters are easy to sympathize with (how many of us have felt rejected over someone else?) and the parts are well-played. Woody and Buzz both work quite well in character--even if Woody is a completely self-centered jerk--and the minor parts are also nicely done. (As pointed out by other reviewers, the supporting cast of toys mostly deliver the comedy, although Woody's ""Mr. Light-Beer"" is a definite winner). For the most part, it is entirely child-friendly, although I can imagine that many kids would be a little frightened by Sid--who is more like Satan-as-a-mad-doctor in human form than a neighborhood kid. (Also, what kind of parents lets their kid play with fireworks?). As I said before, the crazy ending is as overblown as it gets, but that's part of what makes it memorable.In general, a fun film for families or otherwise, and definitely a classic when it comes to CGI animation. Only about an hour and a half and it does not pad itself out and stays within the appropriate run-time bounds. A nice update on the 'living toys' motif.","

"TOY STORY","brando647","10 August 2010","Pixar's long line of success began in 1993 with TOY STORY, the first in a series of highly successful CG family films. Pixar had the formula nailed from the start, creating a fun kid's film with a powerful story capable of entertaining adults. In the film, we're introduced to the world of Andy's room when no one's around and the toys come to life. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is a classic cowboy doll complete with a pull-string vocal box and reigns as young Andy's favorite toy. For his birthday, Andy receives a flashy new Buzz Lightyear action figure (voiced by Tim Allen) and Woody must cope with the fact that he may have been bumped from the top position. A botched attempt at lodging Buzz behind Andy's desk throws Buzz out into the real world and Woody must bring him back to regain the trust of the other toys.The fun of this kid's film lies in the characters. Allen is hilarious as Buzz and his inability to grasp that he's merely a child's toy and not an actual space ranger, spending half the film trying to return to Star Command; Hanks is a bit neurotic and totally high strung as Woody in his role as the toy-in-charge (going so far as to hold meetings on plastic erosion and establishing a buddy-system for moving day). The room is loaded with great supporting characters in the form of classic playthings from everyone's childhoods: a Slinky dog, a Mr. Potato Head, a piggy bankeach with their own unique personalities. These characters are each fun enough to deserve their own movie and we're lucky to have been given the TOY STORY sequels to return to this world.I really enjoy the film overall (as do just about everyone I know who's seen it) and there is little to complain about. It's amazing to see how well the animation stands up after so many years. You can see that the computer graphics aren't as smooth as modern CG, but it's still near seamless. Pixar's first film is a classic I was happy to introduce to my daughter.","

"TOY STORY","Benjamin-M-Weilert","7 March 2023","One benefit of having children is revisiting movies from my youth. I saw Toy Story (1995) in theaters and was immediately struck by how amazing it was that they made the entire film with computers. While this is no longer something that causes awe, there is something about the first movie to make this leap. Almost 30 years later, Toy Story shows its age in some of its visual aspects. However, the cinematography and storytelling here are top-notch and often made me ignore the CGI which is comparatively less polished than today's effects.To Pixar's credit, they did the best they could by focusing on slightly easier-to-animate characters than humans or animals. The people and pets in Toy Story look horrific (sometimes on purpose) but there has to be grace for the limitations of the time. Still, with the immense flexibility of the digital camera, some shots in Toy Story that would have been impossible in a live-action context are played for maximum effect here to make the world of toys seem absolutely massive. Underlying all of this is some fantastic cinematography that does not skimp on the fundamentals of visual storytelling.While Toy Story is not the first movie geared toward kids to appeal occasionally to adult humor (look no further than Genie's references in Aladdin (1992)), I still laughed at new visual gags decades later that I finally understood as an adult. There's a wide range of emotions that I still feel watching this film. From the unease of Sid's bedroom to the soaring victory of Woody (Tom Hanks) and Buzz (Tim Allen) arriving back in Andy's care, this film hits a lot of emotional beats despite its ""kid movie"" status. Is it a perfect movie? Not quite, but it certainly pushed the door wide open for CGI-animated films for decades to come.An impressive (for its time) visual treat with surprisingly strong fundamentals, I give Toy Story 4.5 stars out of 5.","

The first real mainsteam adult-friendly computer animated film. Actually the first real computer-animated film. Toy Story took a cutesy premise and made it believable with a very good storyline, excellent voice acting and amazing design, especially for the time even though this holds up exceptionally well now. More important than this is the longevity of the characters, you can have the prettiest backdrop and brightest colours going but if a kid doesn't like the characters in the thing it isn't going far. Go to a birthday party for any kid under 10 and you'll likely see a Buzz Lightyear or Woody the cowboy. More important this film can be watched and rewatched by anyone from 3 to 43 and there will be something to enjoy, again and again. As a side-note: My videoshop password was Woody for about 5 years thanks to this movie. What you hope kids will learn: Be good to your toys. What they'll take away: Space toys are cool. And Cowboy toys are cool. And Dog toys are cool. And I need one of those Dinosaur toys. Oh, oh, oh and a Mr Potato Head... And a Piggy!

"TOY STORY","Sirus_the_Virus","28 November 2009","Toy story is the first Pixar animated film. Toy story amazed everyone on earth back in 1995 and still does to this day. That amazes us and so does Pixar. Bringing us some of the best films of our time. Nowadays we have Up, Ratatouille, Wall E, Finding Nemo. The list goes on. But we should remember the first one.Toy story stars Tim Allen and Tom Hanks as Toys. Hanks plays Woody, a cowboy toy who is the most popular from his owner Andy. That all changes when Andy buys a toy called Buzz Lightyear(Tim Allen) who is an astronaut. Woody becomes awfully jealous and tries everything in his power to get rid of Buzz.There are other plot points that I would rather not go into. Toy story creeps me out a little. The thing about it that creeps me out is the villain named Sid. Sid is this toy murderer who lives next door to Andy and the toy gang. There is a part in the end when all of the toys retaliate. That part scares me every time. Watching these destroyed toys retaliate. I never thought something like that could creep me out. I guess I get creeped too easily. The first Toy story is a work of art. It's got great visuals and will creep you out. Kind of like Robert Zemeckis' A Christmas carol, which is another work of art I think. As I have said in many reviews, Toy story is a film that you'll never forget. I haven't. My memory is crap.Toy story:****/****","

"TOY STORY","TheUnknown837-1","3 May 2008","Tom Hanks and Tim Allen put their talents at voice acting to work and they do it with thorough and complete perfection in ""Toy Story"" a Pixar animated classic film that even now, over ten years since its theatrical debut, continues to be loved by audiences of all ages. It retells the child's dream of their inanimate toys suddenly coming to life whenever a human is not around. All of the toys have personalities and they are even organized as their own society.Tom Hanks plays the voice of Woody, a cowboy doll with a pull string and Tim Allen provides the voice of Buzz Lightyear, a new action figure toy that has crushed all other toys at the market--but the thing is, Buzz believes he is really THE character he represents and not an Asian-made product. Among them there are other toys such as Slinky Dog, voiced by Jim Varney, Rex the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn) and Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles). All of the voices are done well and creates the illusion of real talking characters instead of actors providing voices and then having animators synchronize their 3D models with the prerecorded sounds.Now that I am older, I appreciate and cherish ""Toy Story"" and its successful sequel ""Toy Story 2"" (1999) even more than I did when I first saw them as a kid. I now appreciate the character elements, can understand the point of the jokes better, and respect the talents and efforts of the filmmakers who made this movie possible. I recommend both ""Toy Story"" and its sequel as two of Pixar's best films and some of the best family movies of all time. Children will adore and love it, adults will laugh. Bottom line, it's a great movie.","

"TOY STORY","hanalisss","26 October 2023","Toy Story isn't just a movie; it's a groundbreaking cinematic masterpiece that revolutionized animation and storytelling, leaving an indelible mark on the hearts of audiences worldwide.Pixar's inaugural feature film introduces us to a world where toys come to life when humans aren't around, and the narrative unfolds through the eyes of Woody, the cowboy doll voiced by Tom Hanks, and Buzz Lightyear, the space ranger voiced by Tim Allen. The brilliance of the film lies not just in its imaginative premise but in the emotional depth woven into the story.The characters are brought to life with such charm and personality that they transcend their inanimate status. Woody's journey from the beloved favorite to grappling with insecurities and the arrival of the flashy Buzz Lightyear provides a poignant exploration of friendship and identity. Buzz's journey of self-discovery, realizing he's a toy in a world much bigger than his Space Ranger delusions, is both humorous and touching.The voice acting, led by Hanks and Allen, is pitch-perfect, infusing the characters with nuance and authenticity. Their chemistry becomes the heartbeat of the film, creating a dynamic that's both heartwarming and hilarious.The animation, although now surpassed by newer technologies, was groundbreaking for its time. The attention to detail, the expressive character animations, and the imaginative world-building set a standard for animated films that many strive to achieve.Beyond the visual spectacle, Toy Story excels in its storytelling. The script, co-written by Pixar's creative geniuses, crafts a narrative that appeals to all ages. It tackles themes of friendship, loyalty, and the fear of being replaced with a deftness that elicits both laughter and tears.Randy Newman's iconic soundtrack adds another layer of emotion to the film, with the timeless ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" becoming synonymous with the enduring legacy of Toy Story.What truly makes this movie stand the test of time is its universal appeal. It captures the essence of childhood wonder and the bittersweet reality of growing up. The film doesn't just entertain; it resonates with its audience on a deeply emotional level.In conclusion, this isn't merely a movie; it's a cultural touchstone, a nostalgic trip for adults, and an enchanting experience for new generations.

"TOY STORY","emasterslake","1 October 2005","This was the first Pixar movie I've seen. I remember seeing it back 10 years ago, back when it was new. Back then Pixar wasn't too well known in the world. This movie made their intro and beginning of their long line of great movies.Not only was it Pixar's first movie, but it was also the first ever CGI Movie ever made. Back then I didn't know what CGI was so I didn't had a clue how they even made the movie itself(I was only 7 when I first watched it in theaters).The story to this movie is unlike anything you've seen before. It all has to do with what do Toys do when no one is around to play with them. It features memorable characters and some existing toys like ""Little Tykes, Mr. Potatoe Head, Slinky, Barrel of monkeys, etc."" The main character is Woody a classic Cowboy doll who is the favorite toy of Andy, a kind and good boy. He gets respect and pride from the other toys. Life seems good for him.Till one day on Andy's Birthday, he receives a special toy that any boy would want a ""Buzz Lightyear"" action figure. Who has cool features that not even Woody has. And Woody fears Buzz will be Andy's new favorite toy and lose his respect and pride with the other toys.Toy story has some laughs, excitement, and great visuals for a Well done CGI movie. Every Animation lover should see this movie. If you like this movie, you'll like the sequel even more.I give it an 8/10 perfect movie for the whole family to watch.","

"TOY STORY","sharky_55","22 July 2015","It was May of 1991, and Disney were on the brink of the Animation Renaissance which would bring about a treasure-trove of beautifully drawn and designed 2D films. Only a few months later would the first and very elegant Beauty and The Beast be released. But behind the scenes, they negotiated a deal with a small animation studio named Pixar, previously only animating shorts to demonstrate the capabilities of their computers. John Lasseter would serve as director after being fired from Disney as he pitched the revolutionary idea of the first ever fully computer animated full length feature film. And so Toy Story was born. It was a long and complicated production process full of worries about budget, and the infamous Black Friday reveal which prompted a production shut-down and a full script revamp. It's sequel would later nearly undergo a disaster of similar scale. But after an arduous process Toy Story became a ground breaking film in animation history and set the first benchmark for 3D animation. Toy Story is a beautifully rendered film for its time and eye poppingly gorgeous. Pixar's revolutionary animation process created a living breathing world with every tiny detail lovingly crafted - blades of grass, hairs on head, scuffs on floorboards. The character movement is smooth and seamless, the use of light and shadow realistic. Being Pixar's first ever feature film and under close scrutiny from Disney executives and given a small budget, short cuts like ponytails and short hair were used, and the textures of the background and minor characters are less visually impressive, but Tory Story still holds up remarkably well decades later. It's all wrapped in a stirring score by Randy Newman which easily accompanies the film's movement; lifting for Buzz's first take-off, eerily tip-toeing at the Spaceport Arcade. The main song You've Got a Friend in Me is heartfelt at the start of the film but even more-so at the end, Newman duetting with Lyle Lovett to symbolise the new partnership of Buzz and Woody. The story is a simple but universal one, with an original twist. What happens when toys are alive, and furthermore, what happens when they are replaced by newer, cooler models? The titular characters of Buzz and Woody are stunningly brought to life through fantastic character design and voice-acting. Woody is your classic Western cowboy with a pull string that spouts recorded catchphrases while Buzz Lightyear is a futuristic Space Ranger who has pop-out wings and a laser. Who can compete with that? Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provide a great deal of emotion and character through their respective portrayals; in particular Woody's charm and leadership is a thin veneer for his insecurity and ego which is displayed when Andy gets a newer toy. Terry Gilliam singles out a great shot at the height of Buzz's personality as a Space Ranger, where he discover he is actually just a toy, and where the camera zooms out and the big bravado he was only a moment earlier is now a tiny figure. But apart from them you have a whole cast of iconic characters each with their quirks, personalities and traits; Mr Potato Head, Re the dinosaur, Slinky Dog, Hamm the piggy bank, Bo Peep, the plastic toy soldiers...We get the sense that these toys have been in the Andy household forever, and have formed a tight knit family and well-oiled hierarchy. the sequel 4 years later gives them additional screen-time which comes with more laughs (including the addition of Mr Potato Head's wife). Toy Story set the first benchmark for computer animation and heralded a period of critical and box office success for Pixar. The 2 sequels are also crafted with as much detail and care as the first, but nothing can match the first gasps of wonder and amazement at the movement and freedom of the 3D world when it first hit cinemas in 1995.","

"TOY STORY","joseloreto","3 January 2016","That film has made its first success with the most beloved buddy picture of all time! The Next Who Framed Roger Rabbit I love how they try to make something different with CGI, because all they've done in the beginning were commercials and shorts. Ever since John Lasseter saw Tron, he knew that CGI would go all over the place. And boy has Pixar nailed it!The Story has taken itself to a whole new level, it's all about getting back to a young boy by using the power of teamwork, accepting for what you are, and telling the truth in an innocent way. Woody never meant to hurt Buzz, he just wanted to spend his life with Andy. The other toys are blinded by this accident that they decide to toss their leader out like garbage.Sid is what I believe the best villain for three reasons1.He's the bully for the toys2.He's stuck in the mind of a mad doctor or scientist 3.He learns an important lesson that toys are meant to be in heaven, not in toy hell. Unless you're a Losto Bear who thinks that humans are the enemies.Man! This is the reason why people loved the 90's. There was a time when animation wanted to push itself to next level. And Toy Story was one the important examples of being the greatest survivors with a lovely story, fresh start animation, amazing characters, and epic songs by Randy Newman.This could be a fresh start for those who wanna tell stories.In fact I have novel that I'm working on.

"TOY STORY","hall895","8 September 2010","Nowadays people assume that when it comes to what they see up on the big screen computers make absolutely anything possible. If you can dream it you can see it with the assistance of a little computer wizardry. But of course that was not always the case. The computer animation revolution had to start somewhere and that somewhere was Toy Story. The animators at Pixar made the impossible possible. You watch the movie today and it's easy to take it for granted. You forget that Pixar was attempting something entirely new and that there were more than a few doubts as to whether it would work. Oh, it worked alright. It worked spectacularly. Director John Lasseter and his animation team created a visually stunning masterpiece the likes of which had never been seen before. Movie animation would never be the same, Toy Story changed everything.The movie looks great but in order to be deemed a success there had to be a story to match the visuals. All the technological wizardry in the world would not have been able to hide a lousy story. Thankfully that proved to be no concern as we get a compelling and endearing storyline, one which provides plenty of opportunities for some good laughs as well. For as revolutionary as the animation was it is the story and the characters which ultimately make the movie so beloved. To infinity and beyond! Just saying it brings a smile to your face. The toys which are the stars of this story are great, memorable characters. Each is infused with its own unique personality. You can dismiss no toy as ""just a toy"". Each toy has its own story, its own life. All the voice actors deserve great credit for the work they did in making each toy stand out in its own way. Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear are of course the big stars and they both fit their roles perfectly. But whether playing a dog, a pig or a potato head each voice actor was uniformly terrific. R. Lee Ermey as a little green army man and Wallace Shawn as a Tyrannosaurus with serious anxiety issues are two personal favorites. So many characters which are so easy to embrace and each of whom is good for some laughs too. And there's even room for a great villain in Sid, the evil toy-destroying kid next door. A great cast of characters brought brilliantly to life by the great work of the animators and the voice cast.Toy Story triumphs in making you feel for its characters. Who can't empathize with Woody as he fears being pushed aside by Buzz? Who hasn't had insecurities like Rex? Who can't understand Mr. Potato Head's longing for a Mrs. Potato Head? When the toys hurt you hurt, when they triumph you feel as if you shared in it. It's a movie guaranteed to put a smile on your face. If there's any complaint it might be that the movie, at a trim 80 minutes, isn't long enough. We want to spend more time with these toys. Of course we would get the opportunity to do so in sequels to come. But the original movie certainly stands on its own merits. It's a movie you can happily watch again and again. And when you do take the time to really look at the world the animation team created for these toys to inhabit. The level of detail in the backgrounds is just as stunning as the beautifully rendered main characters. No corners were cut in creating a world which looks truly lived in. A whole world magically brought to life. Toy Story was, in its time, unlike anything anyone had ever seen. And all these years later the magic is still there. It's a movie which will be discovered, and loved, by generations to come.","

"TOY STORY","Stampsfightclub","3 January 2009","Andy's favourite toy Woody the cowboy gets jealous when he is replaced by the new space toy Buzz Lightyear.Anyone of any age who has already seen this film will tell you, no matter what think about CGI, that the sheer concept of this film is excellent. For the person who thought up the idea of toys coming to life, thank you. You have given this world an imaginative theory, which will be with us every time we leave the room.Though everything about this film is exquisite, the ideology of living toys makes it what it is. When we first see Woody get up off the bed we need to blink a couple of times to make sure its real. Of course with modern technology CGI is hard not to use and this film was one of the first that was used effectively and though has now lost its significance. Nothing is lost in terms of the story however and the visuals and the finest direction Pixar ever achieved until Wall-E help create a warm fun family film. Will any other company beat Pixar on the animation stage? Shrek, Kung Fu Panda and Madagascar, though all good, don't have that extra depth and sophistication Pixar creates so easily.Filled with great laughs and a suspense adventure, Toy Story is a sit down and enjoyable movie for the whole family. But then it is so much more than a movie.Every Pixar movie has a message. Wall-E provided an insight into loneliness and the good of man kind, Monsters Inc told the tale of children's fairy tales and Cars reflects doing something for others.This 1995 hit preaches to its audience through its characters. Woody's jealousy at being replaced and his suffering are almost tear worthy. We have all had our favourite toys and replaced them and this simple message will trigger something deep down inside any viewer. Buzz's commitment to who he really is and his strong beliefs are great in shaping his character and preaching to viewers to believe who they really are.Most importantly though is friendship and how important it can be to get someone out of trouble for the good of someone else. This message is further emphasised through the best Pixar song of all time, ""You've got a friend in me"" Always consistent, always funny and always entertaining, Toy Story is a fun family film that will forever be remembered for its strong messages, entertainment and animation.","

A toy astronaut (Tim Allen) refuses to accept that he is simply a plaything and becomes the favourite of a small boy - which makes his previous preferred toy (Tom Hanks), a cowboy, deeply jealous.Toy Story is a sensational animated feature, a milestone in this specific genre. It was the first such film to be completely computer-generated, and fully exploited this technological advance to the maximum to tell its tale with great humour and conviction. A rare 'family film' that everyone in the family will genuinely enjoy; adults for its sophisticated charm, and children for its affectionate, imaginative fantasy about what toys get up to when humans leave the room.","

This movie holds up incredibly well in today's viewing. The movie is timeless. The plot is easy to follow as it is a children's movie. However, there is a lot to enjoy in this movie as an adult. The movie is directed exceptionally well and has themes in this movie that will not bore adult audiences. The plot is aided greatly by its characters. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen play Woody and Buzz incredibly well and this plays off of the story.

I also liked the end title duet. The score was good too. I wasn't over impressed by the animation since I consider story & characters to be more important. Since I didn't like those I can't recommend this. But if you do want to see great animation Ice Age & Anastasia are two of the best.

"TOY STORY","agmoldham","3 May 2004","It doesn't matter whether you're young or old, this is a great movie. Woody is Andy's favourite toy and like all the other toys lives with the fear of being discarded when new toys arrive. He's therefore very worried when Buzz Lightyear arrives. Buzz is an instant hit with Andy and Woody is not very happy. To make matters worse Buzz doesn't think he is a toy and believes he is on a mission. The story really gets going when woody inadvertantly knocks buzz out of the house and the two of them end up with evil Syd who tortures toys.There's lots of adult humour meaning that the parents will find this as funny as the kids. The real winning combination of Toy Story is the characterisation and the empathy you can feel for the animated leads. Although they're not real this is one of the best buddy movies ever made. My personal favourite character is Mr Potato Head because of the dry humour. A classic 10/10","

Now we all know that when we see a pixar movie ( especially one with the likes of john lassetter involved in it) that we are in for a cinematic experience.This movie fulfills every child's dream. Haven't you ever wondered what your toys do when you aren't there. I know I did when I was a kid, I myself had a buzz lightyear doll and I always imagined him having that Tim Allen voice.not only does it fulfill the child's dream, but there is a ton of easter eggs that pixar has included that will keep the teenagers and adults interested and laughing as well. Even 16 years after the original release date I still watch the movie and I am still finding little subliminal messages (easter eggs) that pixar has included.Disney/ pixar headed by john lassetter do a great job in making an unbelievable movie seem as believable as possible. Just for a second forget that these are toys we are talking about here and imagine that they are real people. Would they have acted any different to how they did? Knowing that what the characters did and how they reacted and how it is on unreasonable to consider that they might act that way is the key to good script writing and good storytelling. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen also do a marvellous job at heading the cast making every line seem funnier or more dramatic than it actually is.Overall i would not just recommend this, this is a MUST SEE for any kid or adult.

The soul ingredient of the story is simply what happens when your toys are left alone and the benefits (and downfalls) of being a toy. But what amazes me the most is the emotional connection that it gives to anyone at any age and what keeps it together is the friendship between toys, even though they are only toys, the movie easily grasps the emotions of 2 people turned into best friends.Of course sometime in the future another animated movie will have the same success or more than Toy Story and may even beat it.

This concept of living toys is a kid's dream come true, but in this case without the kid's awareness. We get into the behind of the scenes: The toys are not just living a simple life, but they have their own community with their own rules, routines, and cultures, brought by all types of toys, everything from a shark toy to a potato head. Every toy has also it's own personality, which gets quite interesting and entertaining.

The movie is an amazing watch, Tom Hanks & Tim Allen done amazing jobs voicing Woody & Buzz Lightyear. You notice certain things as you get older, the hidden messages put in this gems is incredible. The grsat thing about this kovie is that it's family friendly, so you can watch it with anyone.I really enjoyed watching this, it keeps you engaged in the story, whether you're an adult or a child this is a good watch.",NA
"TOY STORY","PersianPlaya408","29 May 2006","This is a great film from pixar/Disney, i found it to be very effective because Hanks and Allen were amazing voices for this type of film. I thought Toy Story was way better than A bug's life, Finding nemo or even ice age which was pretty good. I usually don't like films like this, I'm more of a mature film type person, however it is impossible not to be entertained while watching this. I liked Tim Allen a lot, he stole the show, though hanks did a good job with his character too. Tim Allen needs to do more films like this and less Santa Clause ones, because these are more his type, even if he doesn't show his face. This is one that the kids and the adults can watch and enjoy 9/10",NA

"TOY STORY","OriginalMovieBuff21","27 April 2004","Toy Story is brilliant!!! It is the best disney pixar movie ever made with tons coming tied at second. The animation is amazing and Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were brilliant in there performances as Woody and Buzz Lightyear. The humor of this movie also is extremely funny. Mr. Potato Head is the funniest character of the film. He makes you laugh in like almost every scene. There are so many timeless qualities that I just can't name them all. I recommend every one to see it. You can be 1-95 years old and still see it. It's a great family film and you will laugh your head off in some of the scenes!!!10/10",NA
"TOY STORY","EmperorNortonII","5 May 2001","""Toy Story"" has been said to be the first great fully computer animated feature ever.  And I must agree.  Computer animation has been used before, in movies like ""Tron.""  But only in ""Toy Story"" has it been used with such great effect.  Seeing animation like this is impressive.  Truly cinematic history was made with this movie!  The technology may be improving past the level it had achieved when ""Toy Story"" was made.  But you just can't forget this milestone!",NA

"TOY STORY","baileycrawly","15 November 2020","Toy Story was never my favorite Pixar film. I had the opportunity to see it twice in theaters, once shortly after its initial run when it was given a limited-edition local screening, and once in a 3D double feature released just ahead of Toy Story 3. And, of course, I've had it on VHS, DVD and BluRay to watch multiple times.One of the things I've always admired about Toy Story is how nice the animation looks for the time it was released. Pixar clearly had access to the best equipment and talent when they put this film together, and it shows. There isn't a single aspect of the film that's overlooked. It's got serious star power in the casting department (Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are both incredible, respectively, in their leading roles), you've got a great score (some of the better work from Randy Newman, who I've never been a big fan of personally), it's got a unique story that's executed in just the right way to ensure the proper emotions are being conjured up at any given point during the film. Pixar has what I can only compare to a mathematical equation by which they tell their stories; everything is carefully constructed and calculated, and every move they make in the stories pays off well.It was the most appealing or entertaining of the Pixar stories to me growing up (or even now), but to look at the film and everything it was accomplishing in its time and to say it offers nothing of merit would be blatantly untrue.",NA
"TOY STORY","TalesfromTheCryptfan","24 April 2006","In a world where toys come to life when people aren't around, a cowboy doll named Woody ( voiced by Tom Hanks) was Andy's favorite toy until now he gets a new favorite which is a space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear ( voiced by Tim Allen) that talks, glows in the dark, has a laser, and has wings. It starts to make Woody a little jealous as one day he pushes him out the window by accident that leads him and buzz on a adventure to return back home on their way from Pizza Planet to the evil toy torturing kid Sid's house as they have to return home before Andy moves.A monumental movie that has became the world's first computer animated movie and made movie history! The movie became a phenomenon ever since it was released in 1995 among the world even critics and audiences alike were amazed by the wizardry and storytelling techniques. Alongside the movie is an impressive cast that includes Annie Potts, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, and Jim Varney as the movie will be a classic for years to come and a must have for your collection.",NA
"TOY STORY","TheMysteriousReviewer","20 February 2021","Toy Story gives CGI animation a really good start. This movie took its execution on the concept of living toys to a whole new level thanks to a very engaging story. The characters are also highly memorable. And the humor is very clever with some jokes the movie can get away with. The animation can look outdated, but there's no denying it looks really good to this day. This is the kind of CGI animation we had back in the earlier days. Funny enough, I have seen some deleted scenes that I'm honestly glad it didn't make it to the movie. Otherwise, they would keep this from being Pixar's amazing debut. If you're in the mood to watch a comedy or something related to Pixar, this is definitely worth checking out. This movie is all these years that's to infinity and beyond.",NA
"TOY STORY","pasenter","15 April 2014","Although i like to think the 3rd is the best, everyone should respect this film, the first feature film to be animated, and still holds up as one of the best! And not to mention being in the top 250, thats a accomplishment! this film will forever stay with me as a Nostalgic relic, i only hope that newer generations will remember this film as i do.I still like to think of this as my favorite film of all time, if anyone was to ask me, usually because i can't think of one i'd rather be proud of saying i love it so much, or maybe i'm a total hipster?This film for me is a 8/10, not as perfect as the 3rd, but good enough for any Pixar fan.",NA
"TOY STORY","TheHonestCritic","4 October 2019","""Toy Story"" (1995), this is the movie that pioneered the CGI animated film era. To this day, it's still a legendary film, just like most of the other films made by Pixar Animation Studios! Everything is perfect, and fires on all cylinders. The story is still memorable to this day. Very creative premise, it pulls you in and keeps you hooked from beginning to end. The voice acting is perfect from all of the voice actors. They couldn't have picked better voice actors! The animation holds up to this day, as does the animation in the other Pixar films. Finally, the soundtrack is phenomenal and it helps bring this movie to life. You can play a little part from any part of the music score, and be able to identify what movie it is right away. That's the sign of a great soundtrack! Pixar, without a shadow of a doubt, makes the best CGI animated films of all-time. ""Toy Story"" really opened the door to future possibilities, and still influences the world of cinema to this day. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. I give this film a full 5 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. This movie is perfect for people of all ages. If you haven't seen ""Toy Story"" yet, which would surprise me greatly, I mean seriously, who hasn't seen it? Go watch it, I guarantee you'll love it!",NA
"TOY STORY","shojo_sanzo","5 June 2005","""Toy Story"" is by far one of the most popular of Pixar's creations.Pixar got a lot of recognition from this movie and there is only one reason:This is a really good movie.It is a movie about the two main ""toy"" characters Woody:the toy cowboy and Buzz Lightyear:the toy space man.Both of them are very funny characters.Some of the side characters were funny too.This is a great movie and you'll be sorry if you missed watching it. This movie is not only good and entertaining but it is also really hilarious.There are jokes threw out the movie that are all quite funny.This a great movie for kids because it doesn't have complected language or any ""no-nos'"" that kids shouldn't see.So parents out there tell your kids about this movie because there is a 80% chance they'll like it a lot.I rate this movie a 9/10 because it's a really great movie and it's quite entertaining.:-D",NA

"TOY STORY","departed07","19 March 2005","Kids have always wondered if their toys ever came to life when they were asleep and if the toys themselves had lives of their own by doing the same things that humans do.Toy Story is the first film from Pixar Studios to make cartoons more humanistic with CGI than by drawing them out. Tom Hanks provides the voice of Woody the Cowboy, who is the ringleader of the toys around Andy's room. He overhears the important events around Andy's life and one of the things shocking is that they are moving to another home.Most of Andy's toys are compiled of average boy toys: from a nervous dinosaur name Rex (Wallace Shawn) to a grumpy Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickels), a smart Aleck piggy bank called Hamm (John Ratzenburg); even Andy's little sister has toys that join with the gang, Bo Peep (Annie Potts of ""Ghostbusters"" fame) has a crush on the cowboy. There are other characters in the story; a dog on a string name Slinky Dog (Jim Varney of ""Ernest"" fame) and a plastic army doll name Sarge (R. Lee Ermey of Full Metal Jacket).One of the elements of ""Toy Story"" is very psychological, and that is the fear of a new toy. Sure everybody likes to get a new toy, but the problem is that when people buy new toys, they automatically forget that their old toys exist and lose excitement within them. When Andy's birthday party comes a week before the leave, Woody sends Sarge and the plastic army men with the baby talkers to hear what kind of presents Andy has gotten this year. As Mr. Potato jokes that he wants a wife, the gang gets cut off by a nervous Rex and realize that the toys have to stay still.The new toy in Andy's life is the popular and all out, Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) in which he pushes Woody to the side leaving the new toy on the bed. Everybody clamors over Woody being pushed off the bed as every other toy in the room tries to figure out what's up there.Woody is introduced to the new character as he tells everyone he can fly and fire a high laser. A smart-ass Potato Head makes a statement about Woody's voice box that it sounds a car ran over it. Days before the move, Woody is left out of the group as everybody including Bo Peep are all with Buzz Lightyear.Woody has a plan of getting rid of Buzz and he uses an electric race-car to push him out the window. Now every toy is against Woody and want to beat him up; but Andy saves Woody when him and the rest of his family are going out for pizza and can't find Buzz, so Andy takes the cowboy instead. With little relief, when the car stops at a gas station, Buzz has been hiding under the car and fights with Woody outside; suddenly the car leaves with both toys stranded.Buzz has a plan for both him and Woody to get back with Andy; they get into a pizza truck and try to find Andy and his family and notices that the neighborhood bully Sid is there so the toys hide in a toy machine where they are taken with another toy back to Sid's house where one toy is torture to death (relax, its not the main toys). So now they have to work together in order to be with Andy and tell the other toys that everything is all right.""Toy Story"" is a blessing with delight and wonder and just like my review of ""Monsters, Inc."" it's a movie of curiosity and a joy to behold.",NA
"TOY STORY","andrewroy-04316","22 June 2019","Honestly, I don't think I can fully appreciate Toy Story's boldness and uniqueness, as Pixar has since made great family computer generated animated movies ubiquitous, and I certainly have been able to take that for granted my whole life. Even so, watching Toy Story for the first time in over a decade, it exceeded my expectations in its characters and script, and the animation looks as good as ever. Woody's internal struggles and seeing a protagonist of a kid's movie be clearly flawed but still likable is so refreshing. I love the animosity between Woody and Buzz, and the way the toys each have their own quirks but are something of a hive mind. Even if the events that occur are a bit over the top, the structure and plot is actually really exciting and coherently presented. I loved the misjudgement of Sid's toys and their role in the success. I've seen movies twice as long fail to deliver on half as realistic and well fleshed out characters or emotional stakes as in Toy Story. Between the groundbreaking animation for the time, the consistent characters and plot, and sheer adolescent joy and adventure, Toy Story deserves its place as a classic.",NA

"TOY STORY","beresfordjd","23 July 2016","What can I say that has not been said about this superb piece of work? Pixar have redefined what animation is all about. The concept, the story, the writing and the voice-overs could hardly be bettered. The toys are real individual characters brought to believable life by the actors who voice them. Special mention for Tom Hanks as you really cannot separate his voice from Woody's character. It works on every level. Kids love it, as do teenagers, young adults and pensioners like me too. The songs by Randy Newman are not too intrusive and actually enhance the story and move it on too. The amount of work that must have gone into the brainstorming before production started must have been amazing. It would have been great to have an insight into all that. Everyone should be made to watch this - it has a lot to say about life and relationships.",NA
"TOY STORY","ariaisnotthebusinesstype","15 February 2019","I grew up on this movie as my older brother was obsessed with it, and grew to dislike it just because he loved it. Now, as an adult, I love this movie. Love the emotional scenes about change, and just how this was pretty much the most important film in animation history. It was a fantastic start to many great movies.",NA
