"FLIPPED","lewiskendell","22 December 2010","""All I ever wanted was for Juli Baker to leave me alone.""Flipped is easily the best love story/relationship movie I've seen since (500) Days of Summer. I'm the kind of guy that you couldn't pay to watch a Nicholas Sparks movie, but that doesn't mean that I can't appreciate a good movie about the highs and lows of love. In a year of formulaic, mind-numbing flicks with no imagination or heart like Letters to Juliet, Flipped is a welcome breath of fresh air. It's about 8 or so years in the lives of two kids who meet when when one of them moves into a new neighborhood. Juli (played by Morgan Lily and Madeline Carroll) is instantly smitten by Bryce (Ryan Ketzner and Callan McAuliffe) the second she sees him drive up to his new house. Bryce, being a typical second grade boy, finds her attention embarrassing and unwanted. As they get older, that dynamic between them remains pretty much the same, but we wouldn't have a very interesting movie if that's all there was to it. Eventually Bryce finds himself on the other side of the equation (flipped, get it?), and has to win back the girl he never knew he always wanted.How odd is it that a movie about a couple of kids handles the topic of love in a more mature and genuine way than almost all of the adult-oriented romantic comedies that we're buried under each year? There's no doubt about it that Flipped will make you say ""aww"" on occasion, but there's a lot more to it than just kids being cute. Humor, issues of class, family conflict, and the lost idealism of youth are introduced into the story by Bryce and Juli's respective families, and there are several outright bittersweet or poignant scenes within the story.The movie is shown from the POV's of both main characters, and often the same event will be shown from each of their perspectives. It works really well, as it really helps the viewer to ""get"" both Bryce and Juli. The kids chosen to play the older versions of the two (Carroll and McAuliffe) are both great, the fact that the story is set in 50's or 60's suburbia adds a believable sense of innocence to it all, and there is just a fresh feeling to the movie that I can't really describe with words.I heartily recommend this to anyone who likes a good, well-written movie, regardless of the genre. You can tell that a lot of heart went into making Flipped, and it shows. Great movie.","

"FLIPPED","neenahhh","5 April 2011","'Flipped' is truly a ""real movie"". Probably what most people enjoyed about this movie was that the events that happened in the movie could might as well have been their reality. Many people in this world (if not all) have experienced having a real crush. This movie shows a crush blossoming from both a guy's and a girl's view. It was very interesting to see two viewpoints on this everyday happening. That is what makes this movie so appealing. Viewers get to watch Bryce and Juli's emotions whenever they see the other. Viewers see Bryce and Juli's smiles that they can't help. Viewers get to know who exactly Bryce and Juli are.Anyone and everyone will enjoy this movie or can at least, relate to it. Even adults! This film will surely take you down memory lane and help you remember the feelings you had when you were first in love. I've never experienced being in love before, but this film makes it seem wonderful. I absolutely loved this film.Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe were great in this film! Even if they're very young, they did wonderful jobs in performing here. In each of their scenes, you could sense the emotions that they were feeling and wanted to convey to the viewers. The characters themselves were also very interesting. Particularly Ms. Juli Baker. It was nice to see such a free-spirited teenager, who was very opinionated and didn't let anything stand in her way. The chemistry that both actors had were average. I thought that they showed their most potential when acting by themselves, in their own surroundings.I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that Rob Reiner, the director of this film, was the same person who directed 'When Harry Met Sally' and 'Sleepless in Seattle'. So far, all romantic-comedies that Rob Reiner has directed has not disappointed me. I can't wait for more of his works! All his rom-coms are excellent additions to the romance movie genre.This was an amazing teenage romantic comedy. Surely one of my favorites, right up there with 'When Harry Met Sally'. Do not miss this film. It's baffling to see that this film isn't as popular as it's supposed to be.Viewed on: April 5, 2011 ; December 16, 2011","

"FLIPPED","napierslogs","13 December 2010","Juli just had to take one look at Bryce's blue eyes, and she knew it was true love. Bryce just had to take one notice of Juli's manic desperation, and he knew it was going to be a friendship of torment. I just had to take one look at the film's artfully designed poster, and I knew ""Flipped"" was a film to be savoured.A beautifully told film of first love, we flip from Juli's point of view to Bryce's point of view, very effectively giving us the true nature of their friendship, love and respect they have for each other. Except in the case of middle-school graders, that love and respect can frequently look like embarrassment, mistrust, and shame. All of those emotions are told with intelligence, subtlety and humour.""Flipped"" has all of the comedy, naiveté and bewilderment of first love. It takes the romantic comedy farther by actually giving us characters with real depth. There is more going on than just Juli and Bryce figuring out their love for each other, and every aspect of this film is well written, touching and relevant.""Flipped"" is a cute film for everybody who fondly remembers that fiercely independent girl or the guy with piercing blue eyes that lived across the street.","

"FLIPPED","leiser18","14 September 2010","""Flipped"" is superbly directed by Rob Reiner and in my book, one of his best movies. It's a wonderfully told coming-of-age story, which I could relate to in many ways. The main two characters, Juli and Bryce, are very likable. Their parents, played by Penelope Ann Miller and Aidan Quinn, Rebecca de Mornay and Anthony Edwards, respectively, are believable in their roles, which they play excellently. I liked the fact that the story is told from two points of views, Bryce first and then Juli. If you want to see a really feel-good movie, instead of watching some dumb comedy or shoot 'em up flick, go see FLIPPED! You will not regret it.","

"FLIPPED","Gpanther67","24 June 2021","I just discovered this gem on Netflix and was impressed, moved and entertained. Its a romantic film about puppy love, so it may not be for everyone (even teens) but I found the leads to be charming and charismatic. The plot device is nothing new, but the charm and early 60's setting make it fresh in many ways. A wonderful cast led by the young leads (now grown!), the late John Mahoney and Aidan Quinn help make this film watchable and enjoyable. A wholesome movie with wonderful moments.","

The character development was good, not like many movies which focus on only the main characters. Though the story was a little predictable, the movie is enjoyable and among a few to which we can relate to.This movie is definitely worth a watch.And it deserves an 8 out of 10.","

"FLIPPED","brettster","14 August 2010","Back in 1973, an episode of ""All in the Family"" told the same story from three different perspectives, one of which was from the point of view of Mike ""Meathead"" Stivic, played by Rob Reiner. Watching his latest directorial effort, I wondered if the ""he said / she said"" gimmick of that episode (""Everybody Tells the Truth"") was what attracted Reiner to ""Flipped,"" the young-adult novel by Wendelin Van Draanen, which employs the same multi-POV technique that Lawrence Durrell perfected with his ""Alexandria Quartet"" in the late 1950s. The film version of ""Flipped"" shows Reiner at the top of his form, a worthy addition to an ouevre that includes such classics as ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" ""Misery,"" ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Stand By Me,"" the 1986 period piece that ""Flipped"" most recalls, with its younger characters and coming-of-age theme. At the heart of ""Flipped"" is Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll), a smart, pretty and thoughtful girl who you just can't help losing your heart to. Juli herself flips for Bryce Loski, who is at first repelled by Juli and then slowly starts to see her for the lovely person she is. The cast is augmented by such pros as John Mahoney (Frasier's dad on ""Cheers""), Anthony Edwards, Aidan Quinn and Rebecca De Mornay and Penelope Ann Miller. The film offers up various slices of life from the late '50s and early '60s that makes for a nostalgic, romantic and very moving film. Special kudos to the filmmakers for finding a girl to play young Juli (Morgan Lily) who looks chillingly like Madeline Carroll; I would have bet anything the two were sisters. For those who are bored by the dumb-dumb summer comedies of 2010 (""The Other Guys,"" ""Dinner for Schmucks"") and the special-effects hijinks of ""Inception,"" this is a tender and emotionally satisfying journey that will stay with you for years.","

"FLIPPED","planktonrules","28 August 2015","I really, really liked this film and now wonder why it didn't make more impact when it debuted. Perhaps it was just one of those films that slipped between the cracks because ""Flipped"" is a wonderful coming of age film--and is among director Rob Reiner's best.The film is set mostly in the early 1960s. A young boy, Bryce, moves to a new neighborhood and almost instantly the girl across the street, Juli, begins mooning over him and acting like she's infatuated with him. But he's 7--and hating girls and mushy stuff is normal and he resists her charms. But she persists as the years pass--and she's convinced herself that Bryce is her dream boy. But, as the years pass, Bryce is just as convinced that Juli is a pest. However, eventually, Bryce's attitude starts to change...too bad Juli's is as well!This is a remarkable film in so many ways. The direction is wonderful--perfectly paced and very sweet. The writing is also exceptionally sweet and enchanting. It also helped that there were some wonderful supporting actors to assist in telling the story-- some characters you really liked and cared about and a couple who were complete jerks. John Mahoney was particularly good, but the entire cast was wonderful in this movie. Overall, the elements all work together to tell a sweet story that anyone could love. My only quibble, and it's a very minor one, is about the music. Too many older films are saturated with oldies music. While a bit is nice, with some it sounds more like a best of record album...and at times I would have preferred ""Flipped"" to have been a bit quieter. Not a major complaint by any means and I still give this film a well deserved 9.","

"FLIPPED","blackfirepro","26 July 2010","Okay, let's dispense immediately with the idea that this film is geared toward teenagers and all of their sap that they go through. I assure you ""mature adults"" out there that this film will delight you also, unless you are a completely hopelessly lost Scrooge. This film should make sense to all ages. Everyone should identify with it. I don't care what kind of a snob, low-life, big wig, or puritan you are, you should enjoy this film. It's never too sappy when it deals with matters of the heart, nor is it too blunt and insensitive.The film is told almost entirely in a voice over of one of the two main characters. It's told in a brilliant he-said she-said style where the same scene is often told twice from the two opposite points of view (Juli's and Bryce's). So we see the opening scene twice. The first time as explained by Bryce, and the second time explained by Juli. This sort of formula is used many a time in the unfolding battle of the sexes. Of course this doesn't happen in every scene—that would get boring. Director Reiner gives us the proper dosage of everything in this film. The proper amount of comedy, romance, and the proper amount of sadness. Never is it sappy or indulgent or even presumptuous. It's a perfect film for what it's worth. The screenplay is absolutely the work of a fine craftsman—or craftsmen Andrew Scheinman and director Reiner. I don't know how long it took to write or how much blood went into it, but this film is the result of excellent work in every department. The two child stars are perfect in their roles (although Bryce could have done better), but the strength of the cast are in supporting actors. The cast is full of great actors, particularly Anthony Edwards as Bryce's arrogant, critical, smart-Aleck father, and the ever-welcome Aidan Quinn as Juli's loving, down-to-earth, tree painting father.I wasn't completely convinced of the excellence of the film until a beautiful scene in which Mr. Baker (Quinn) and Juli go to visit Mr. Baker's mentally retarded brother Daniel, who is so happy with the world and everything in it. But this scene can't be expressed in words, you have to see it. For what it's worth, Flipped is somewhat of a deep film, full of parallels to the real world. All of the characters have the proper amount of development, even the big sycamore tree that Juli likes to sit in and watch the sunrise. Her exploits while up in that tree are so poetic and beautiful when matched up with the pictures on screen. It's a beautiful and insightful scene into the thoughts and feelings of people in general, not just a teenage girl.In this day when films are almost all big-budget action movies with loud explosions, Flipped has explosions of its own kind. It has explosions of heart and feeling and character, all at the appropriate times. I did not find any ax to grind here. Other than the characters, plot, and screenplay, it's also a technically beautiful film. The camera captures everything so clearly with the proper color timing and excellently framed shots. After the mid-way point of the film, being surrounded by excellence, one starts to look for any reason to criticize the film. I found none. Every nuance of the film is done so genteelly and honestly, who can have a problem with it? This film achieves what movies are meant to achieve. They are meant to reach into are minds and draw us in, to entertain and to move us with fright, emotion, tears, laughs, whatever may be the subject. They are meant to create a world around us, whether in space, in the Wild West, in the future, in Bible times, or in the case of Flipped in 1960s suburbia. This film does exactly what it is meant to do. To touch and make us laugh and to remember. That's what it does. It makes us remember what happened or is happening to us. No one can give this a bad review. I don't see how anyone can pick a fight with the film. But I'm blabbing about nothing.In short, Flipped is by far the best film I've seen this year. I do hope the Academy doesn't overlook this like they do so many other ""family"" films. It should at least get a few nominations, if not a win. We'll see what happens. It's only July.www.colewebbharter.com","

"FLIPPED","kpellerin","9 August 2010","This is a coming of age film set initially and briefly in the late 1950s and mostly in the early 1960s. The boy, Bryce, is chased by his neighbor girl, Juli. And is he chased! Juli is immediately smitten or ""flipped"" by Bryce's eyes and the story unfolds.What is unusual about the story telling is that each major event is played back twice - once through the eyes and voice of Bryce and once through the eyes and voice of Juli. It's the same scene, but you wouldn't know that from their differing viewpoints.Juli is the adventurous and interesting one. Bryce just wants to fit in at their Junior High School. Juli slowly begins to unlike Bryce and Bryce slowly begins to appreciate Juli. Will they ever meet at the same emotional place at the same time? That is the drama and story.The art direction and era are right on. It is the Eisenhower and Kennedy years in look, and even in feel. The wives are subordinate to the husbands. The children are mostly respectful to their parents. And the teachers teach and the students learn. But, you can see the seeds being laid for the rebellious war babies of the late 1960s.Rob Reiner is a talented director for romances - ""When Harry Met Sally."" And he is a talented director for handling young actors - ""Stand By Me."" He combines these talents to help us understand the better part of the human condition; that is, love, respect, sacrifice, forgiveness, and honor. And we have fun and laugh along the way. This is like the TV program, ""Wonder Years"" - but heightened and deepened.-Bob, a Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award Jury Member","

It does what few films do in our time (or rather what they don't do): Flipped does not sacrifice its integrity for raunchy, gratuitous content. It's real. The emotions are real. The characters are real. And while it certainly isn't G-rated fluff (and do not be fooled - this is not a film for young children), the movie is definitely gentle and innocent in many ways. On the downside, without giving anything away, the ending of the film could have been better patched together, but overall the movie is a cinematic gem like no other. Go see Flipped!","

A boy who is annoyed by all the attention he gets from the girl across the street. The girl from across the street who has a super crush on the boy tells her part of the story. The boy's father is a man filled with hatred who dispenses politically incorrect lines throughout the movie. The grandfather, the great John Mohoney, is the wise person who tells the boy to really see the girl for what she is, a very special girl. I don't want to give anything away of this jewel of a movie.

"FLIPPED","boomerchinde","5 November 2013","A very enjoyable movie, effectively embracing the coming of age sensitivities which come to us all. Although it is clear there are many nuances of other characters which never get dealt with, it's meant to be that way. This is about the kids, the effect they have on one another, their ability and inability to express their feelings, and what can happen when we finally face our fears about the other sex and dare to take a step toward resolving them. The only issue I have is that the film simply has too many anachronisms -- songs not of the period and figures of speech clearly from the present and not the fifties and sixties, but hey, I'm too darn picky about that stuff. Reiner has done it again, offering us a film in the style and tone of Capra. He has crafted a film of sensitivity and grace, and taught us something about life that most of us lose upon becoming adults. Madeline Carroll is simply wonderful as the independent teen taking life head on, and is a true pleasure to watch. She absolutely carries this film.","

If it had been done by a different director and had different screenwriters, it might be a terrible cliché. Story of first love, known each other since kids, bla bla bla, we've all heard it before.But this movie, it was so pure and so realistic, which is what I love about it most. It wasn't over the top romantic, but it was enough to tug my heartstrings and made me go ""awwww"" instead of going ""ewwww"".The characters felt like real people, and the issues faced in the story felt so real and believable, it made me believe in the basic form of love once more, and that it still existed in real life (even though I know it's just in the movies, but still).Anyway, if you're looking for a story that is refreshing yet vintage, and wanting to have a lovey-dovey grin plastered on your face, then this is the movie to watch.","

"FLIPPED","YJLcool","15 March 2014","Flipped is a sweet, charming, moving, lovely, well-acted coming-of-age romantic drama comedy film.While the plot offers nothing new in particular (as with mostly all rom- com films)...the 'girl meets boy' mixed with 'the not-your-typical girl next door' story, but the storytelling is slightly different. Adapted from the book with the same name by Wendelin Van Draanen, the film is presented in a rather unique 'he-said she-said' style, through the eyes and thoughts of the male lead, Bryce and then again through the eyes and thoughts of female lead, Juli, alternately presenting their views and perspectives on a shared set of events. Nearly every single event that happened in the film is told at least twice, although it seems repetitive, but surprisingly, it never feels boring or annoying. It's actually fascinating and insightful to be able to see into the thoughts and feelings of people in general. Things are not really what it seems and there's always more than meets the eye. As the film progresses, you are so emotionally invested in the characters that you actually begin to eagerly anticipate what the other side of the story might be, how the other person feels the way he/she does. The film also gives a feeling of nostalgia, even for those who never lived in the era (the story is set in 50's or 60's suburban area) or experienced the same events as the two leads. It feels authentic and relatable nonetheless. Juli might appear as an ordinary girl, but she's a sweet, kind, beautiful, daring girl at heart once you get to know her.The two lead stars are perfect in their respective roles. Most of the characters in the film have sufficient character development for the audience to understand them. Flipped is a period young love story, told in a simple and heartfelt manner. A rare cinematic gem.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/shorter-movie-review-flipped.html Rating: 8/10""A painting is more than the sum of its parts. A cow by itself is just a cow.

"FLIPPED","StevePulaski","14 April 2011","Flipped is a coming of age film directed by the coming of age master director Rob Reiner. Reiner directed the tear-jerker Stand By Me and is now back to bring Wendelin Van Draanen's novel of the same name to life. What a treat! Flipped and Stand By Me both make me wish my childhood was full of more adventure and fun rather than just me sitting on the computer writing review after review aspiring to be a critic. I get tears in my eyes to both films because I become so attached to the characters and they're living the life I can only dream to have. With the exception of unfaithful parents when it comes to Stand By Me.What came to mind halfway through the film was why couldn't the movie Speak have been this good? This film proves more than 80% can be done by narration from TWO characters different perspective and it can be done well. Why not do the same for Speak? Most of the dialog in this film is internal and not directly word of mouth and it works. Why not treat Speak the same way? Were they afraid they would mess it up? It begs an explanation to why Laurie Halse Anderson's novel's potential on film was unfaithful to it's film companion.Never reading the book, I do know that it was set in the nineties and the two thousands while this film's setting is in the late fifties and early sixties. It's not that big of a deal with the drastic setting change, but maybe I would've been more upset if I was a huge fan of the book to find out the film was set four years in the past.The movie about Bryce Loski (McAuliffe), a kid who moves into the neighborhood at a young age to immediately become eye candy to his new neighbor Juli Baker (Carroll). Bryce is resistant, while Juli is persistent. She is positive Bryce will give her her first kiss and believes Bryce is just a little shy, when really he wants nothing to do with her. Juli continues up until present day middle school to give Bryce the chance to admit his ""feelings"" for her but doesn't.Juli lives across the street from Bryce and her yard is an eyesore. It's paid for by the landlord since most of the money Juli and her family makes is given to Juli's father's mentally challenged brother. Bryce's family, his dad mostly, is annoyed by Juli and her family's crappy yard and continue to bad mouth and make assumptions about the Baker family when they really have no idea what it's like over there.The film is narrated by both leads more often than not. Usually we'll get five minutes or so of Bryce narrating his side of the story, while Juli narrates her's. It's almost an anthology because we see what goes on from Bryce's standpoint while hearing his thoughts at the moment and then we see what happened prior or after the events of Bryce's because we then go to Juli. It's confusing. But it works all the time.At the beginning of the film I thought the narrations were only used for the audience to get affiliated with the lives of the characters and what happened before we got here. We spend ninety minutes or longer with movie characters and some films don't even give you the damn courtesy to provide us with any kind of background information. We are supposed to just be thrown into a film with characters we sometimes don't even find out the last names to.The one minor problem I have with the film is the end. It leaves off on the wrong note. The film is only ninety minutes when it could and should be longer. The place they ended was fine, but the scenes on the DVD cover and poster never occur in the film. What a letdown.Flipped is 2010's underrated masterpiece and it definitely showcases a worthy coming of age film. It's smooth style of directing, great music, calm feeling even at it's most stressful, and strong leads are more than I could've asked for. Rob Reiner is something else. A true talent in the movie business. Especially when making a movie as heartfelt as this one.Starring: Callan McAuliffe, Madeline Carroll, Rebecca De Mornay, Anthony Edwards, John Mahoney, Penelope Ann Miller, Aidan Quinn, and Kevin Weisman.

"FLIPPED","bkoganbing","19 March 2014","With a technique borrowed from Casino of the story being told from two different protagonist points of view, Rob Reiner gives us a wonderful family film about first love. Flipped is a lot less bloody and a great deal sweeter than Martin Scorsese's gangster classic.The prosperous Loski family moves into the neighborhood where the ne'er do well Bakers live. On that day in the late fifties the kids that grow up to be Callan McAuliffe and Madeline Carroll set eyes on each other. Carroll thinks McAuliffe is the one, but such decisions at the age of 7 are sometimes reconsidered. And McAuliffe can't see her for beans, she's just an annoying girl which is not atypical for the second grade.Moving into junior high school is a different matter. With the onset of puberty both these kids are experiencing conflicting emotions. McAuliffe acts like a jerk sometimes, Carroll expects a bit much.The families are different. Anthony Edwards who is McAuliffe's dad is a bit of a fathead and has a thing about his neighbor's lifestyle. Their yard contains a chicken coop and is not in good shape and it's bringing down the values of the other property on the block. As for Aidan Quinn who is Carroll's dad and his family lives as it does in order to support his brother who lives in a sanitarium, an expensive private one for the mentally retarded. Quinn is a wonderful dad, but the Bakers live a whole lot like the Micawbers waiting for something to turn up.The women are wiser than the men, Rebecca DeMornay and Penelope Ann Miller the wives of Edwards and Quinn respectively bond. McAuliffe also has the wisdom of his maternal grandfather John Mahoney to lean on. He's a surrogate grandfather to Carroll as well.Rob Reiner came up with a real winner. The kids act like real kids as opposed to Hollywood kids. The grownups are neither all wise Deities or complete idiots. The women young and old do come out better than the men. I think everyone is going to like this one.Flipped is highly rated for family viewing.","

"FLIPPED","treeline1","31 December 2010","Juli fell in love with Bryce when his family moved in across the street; they were both in the second grade and for the next six years, much to his chagrin, she chased him. Bryce thought Juli was a bit of an odd duck and he spent all of his time trying to avoid her until one day, in the eighth grade, he stopped running.I love Rob Reiner's classic coming-of-age film, ""Stand By Me,"" so I expected this movie to be similarly engaging, if not memorable. Unfortunately, it suffers from a weak and boring script, dull and stereotypical characters, and such slow pacing that I thought it would never end. Like ""Stand,"" this story is set in the fifties, but there's nothing endearing or nostalgic about it; the era is poorly recreated and felt too contemporary. Each scene is seen and narrated from both Juli and Bryce's viewpoint and this gimmick gets old fast. I didn't believe these children would dissect every single thing the other did and said; it quickly became predictable and tedious and they sounded like obsessed 40-year olds.All of the actors were competent but their characters were either dull or underdeveloped. They didn't do or say anything interesting, let alone cute or charming. This was a humorless and pointless snooze fest for me.","

"FLIPPED","tedg","8 November 2010","Rob Reiner still has it. This sort of movie is an incredible risk because there are so many ways that it can fail. If you have not seen it, it is a simple Junior High romance taken very seriously. Some rather deep family issues apply; frailty and cowardice in the face of small challenges turned larger. Things could have slipped at many points. There is a wise grandfather who could have become the font of wisdom that makes all well. He is set up to do this, but then he falls away to other dynamics.There are a number of crises, large ones to a child, involving issues that threaten adults. In a similar film, there would be just one of these and it would the occasion for a redemptive but false ending. There are secondary adults that are artificially comic, but they come and go so fast the silly tone they carry does not stick. This thing really does make you cry.The main reason I think is that there is a special narrative device. Every scene is told first through the boy's eyes, narrated directly by him, then replayed. It uses the very same takes I think, but using different camera angles and extended differently. It is set in 1963, which means that the speakers will have been married for decades and are recounting the early stages of their romance. This subtle device is profoundly effective. All the retrospective insights are not those of children, but adults with thankful wisdom. Yet another technique of narrative folding. You don't quite know if the romance will work out, but you do know it will end well.The girl is another flatfaced, appealing talent. These actresses don't seem to do well as adults. We'll see.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","

I always had and still do have an aversion to depiction of children in love, because they're usually cloying and that makes me squeamish. But this was just not that. At all. It really just plays out like the perfect encapsulation of a feeling, as if all these people who acted and worked for this were wheels of a train driving that feeling straight into me.

Contrary to some other reviewers, I liked the ""he said, she said"" narrations, because it let's the viewers see the differring perspectives of the main characters as they experience the same situations.Did it bring back memories? Of course it did. I was still a few years from being born in 1963 when the story takes place, but I think first love - its confusion, its elation, and its pain - is the same regardless of the decade. This film is a delightful charmer. Even though the story's destination is plain from the outset, the ride to get there is wonderful. Highly recommended.","

"FLIPPED","Suradit","26 October 2014","I like most of Rob Reiner's work. ""Stand By Me"" is one of my all-time favorites. This, however, was just tedious. Most of the drama and ""touching moments"" were ridiculous, trite and not even on a par with a mediocre soap opera. At times it seemed almost to be a parody of preachy after-school-specials. Too many things were going on, none of them developed beyond the most superficial level. It almost felt like it was put together from bits & pieces only loosely connected. Way too many segments were literally repeated, supposedly so we could see the same thing first from the boy's point of view, then the girl's. But it was essentially watching the same things happen twice with nothing gained from the additional waste of time.Given the film's director and some of the cast this was a major disappointment. If you want to watch something truly evocative of the 50's & 60's and genuinely coming-of-age, get ""Stand by Me"" and watch that (again). Give this a pass.","

"FLIPPED","WHYeat","6 August 2010","iridescent - adjective: showing luminous colors that seem to change when seen from different angles When I hear ""romantic comedy"" I think of 20 something year olds in New York swapping corny lines via Twitter at a bar. Flipped takes a more adolescent perspective on love in a quainter town and in a quainter time. Interestingly enough, even though the main characters are children, the movie targets an adult crowd. Not because there is adult content, but because it takes an adult who has gone through life's lessons to appreciate the complex and pithy analogy and irony. Although in one intense scene a mom ushered her children out of the theater, don't bring your 4 year olds.Flipped is a story about Bryce Loski and Juli Baker, both of whom narrate the story. The movie begins with Bryce's perspective.Bryce's Perspective: He just moved into town. He's in the moving truck helping his father with the boxes until Juli interrupts and tries to help. His father emphasizes that there are valuables in the boxes, but she can't seem to take a clue. ""Shouldn't you go help your mother in the kitchen, Bryce?"" After a second, the confusion on his face vanishes once he understands his father's ploy. He hops out of the truck and Juli follows closely behind. She puts her arm around him. In defense against cooties he flails his arms, but she somehow gets a hold of his hand. He looks right at her face in disgust. Fortunately, his mom comes out. He resorts to his only defense for a boy his age - he hides behind his mom. Juli is so annoying! Juli's Perspective: Bryce just moved into town. Attracted by his ""dazzling"" eyes, she offers to help, but not 2 minutes pass and his father sends him into the house. She could tell from his face he didn't want to go, so she went after him to see if he'd like to play for a bit before he got stuck inside. To her surprise, Bryce takes her hand and looks lovingly into her eyes. Unfortunately, his mom comes out. Embarrassed about his feelings for her, Bryce hides behind his mom. Bryce is so shy! The entire movie follows this pattern. Bryce and Juli take turns describing their thoughts and motives. It's interesting to watch their contradicting thoughts converge into a single stream of unfolding events. The audience also gets a sense of Bryce's and Juli's personalities. Although Bryce is the handsome young kid at school their vastly different narration proves which of the two has more character. The first scene, Bryce's and Juli's first encounter, gives the false impression that Flipped is a love story. It kind of is. But although the thread that holds everything together is the love story between Bryce and Juli the fabric of the story is substance. The substance of character. Each character's role provides a perspective and a life lesson. The fulcrum upon which these morals are balanced is best represented by the sycamore tree - the gem of the town.The sycamore tree has many symbolic interpretations - all of which are equally appropriate for the story and its characters. Vanity. Juli is enthralled by those ""dazzling"" eyes and is irrationally in love with Bryce. Bryce is equally irrational in his disdain of Juli. Bryce's father is especially guilty of this sin. He washes away the pain of lost aspirations with bourbon and takes comfort in condescension. He refuses Juli's fresh eggs produced by her hens simply because of the Bakers' disheveled front yard. However, the sycamore tree could also represent divinity, protection and strength. Juli's favorite spot in town is the peak of the sycamore tree. Here she reveled in the sunset igniting the surrounding clouds and the wind kissing her skin. She suddenly understood what her father meant when he said the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Juli could see it in the landscape. She could even see it in Bryce, but is he greater or less than the sum of his parts? When the tree's owner decided to cut it down, Juli defended it by remaining in the tree. But when it eventually came down, her vanity, her irrational love, began to come down as well. Juli questions the whole that is Bryce Loski. Likewise, Bryce begins to see Juli from a different angle.Flipped is a gem in itself. I laughed. I cried. No I didn't, but it was very moving. And the writing is pretty good. If you enjoyed The Wonder Years or if you ever daydreamed about that one girl you kissed when you were 13, you'll get a nostalgic kick out of Flipped. If you don't know The Wonder Years and you've never been kissed, you'll still love it. It's flippin' great.Read more chick flick reviews for men @ RatedChick.com","

"FLIPPED","nogodnomasters","12 December 2018","The story consists of first person narrations. First his story, then her story. As always things are never as they seem. It is 1957 when Bryce moves next door to Juli. Juli is forceful, even at age 7. Bryce has great hair, eyes, and smile. Juli is bright and has personality. Byrce's family is somewhat shallow, except for the grandfather. Juli's family is poor by comparison but they have different priorities. The story quickly moves to the seventh grade when Juli realizes that Bryce, while good-looking, may indeed be shallow and not the person of character she should be seeking. Meanwhile, Bryce realizes his short comings and sees that Juli is a person of substance. In addition to the good back and forth for what may be expected for kids that age, it includes as a bonus a good father-daughter relationship film as Juli learns what she needs to know about life from her father. What is good about the movie is that the characters are real. They are not all good or all bad, but human beings attempting to do what they think is right in spite of their flaws.This movie has an indie feel, and is enjoyable to the young at heart for people of all ages, but may be especially enjoyable to seventh grade girls.Rebecca De Mornay is barely recognizable as an early 60's mom.One scene of ""violence"" when Bryce's dad slaps his teen daughter for calling him an a-hole.","

They complement each other beautifully, along with the numerous side characters that surround them. Furthermore, the perspective does not remain on one character and in fact transitions between Bryce and Julie. Rob Reiner did a fantastic job with character development throughout this movie. This is definitely one of the best movies that he has directed.Along with the characters, the movie takes place in the late 1950s and early 1960s which gives off such an innocent, heart warming feel.

Rob Reiner did a superb job telling it entirely in a voice over of one of the two main characters Bryce and Juli tells each side of the story from each point of view. Sometimes the views are not the same. Juli's favorite spot in town is the top of the sycamore tree which is cut down by the yards owner. Juli starts to questions the whole that is Bryce Loski. Likewise, Bryce begins to see Juli from a different angle.Bryce's father played by Anthony Edwards is a typical father of the late 50's. He cares more about the outside appearance then what is really within. He has a darkness inside of him. The wife played by Rebecca De Mornay is susie home maker type of role. The grandfather father played by John Mahoney is a soft speaking man, who moves in with the Loski family tries to get Bryce to see the world with open eyes.It has a great use of that periods music that is well thought out.

Remember those days where much of your thoughts and actions were invested in trying to spend time with your special someone, while that person diligently avoided you, or vice versa? Well, if no, ""Flipped"" will be more than happy to take you back to that point of your life where the world isn't much of a concern, where responsibilities were minimal, where feelings were everything.Most of ""Flipped"" takes place in the year of 1963, a time where kids are required to talk to each other in order to achieve an actual conversation. (""What is this In-ter-net?"") Young Bryce, and the rest of the Loski family, has just moved in to a different neighborhood. And a new home comes with new neighbors. Bryce is getting ready for second grade, who believes that it will be torture because Juli Baker from across the street is publicly in love with him. Juli is trying to get Bryce to like her while Bryce is trying to get Juli to leave him alone. Now tell me, when you were younger, were you a Bryce or a Julie?We see that these kids act out their immediate emotions, and we know that they have yet to understand the depth and reasons behind them. What's to adore other than Bryce's dazzling eyes? So what if Juli likes to spend hours on top of a tree? These kids didn't really ask these questions to themselves, but they didn't need to. They are in the second grade, and are reasonably immature. But, as Bryce and Julie grow older, more mature, they start seeing things at a deeper, more curious perspective. A few years have passed, and Bryce and Juli notice things about the other that were invisible to them before, and their feelings start to flip.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/flipped/","

Lets just say in the words of Robert Downey Jr. He went way past full retard. I have a mentally ill aunt and I've been around her and her fellow roommates at her home my whole life. They go from 0 to 100 on the stereotypical caricature of a mentally ill person. That made me laugh too, at how ridiculous that whole part of the movie was.

"FLIPPED","sunraider","27 November 2010","I decided to ""rent"" this ON DEMAND because I recalled an interview Rob Reiner had done with conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt to discuss this movie at the time of its initial theatrical release. The way this film was talked about made you think it was another ""Stand By Me."" NOT! I hate to give this film such a low rating because there's nothing offensive about the film, but it is boring, slow and just plain uninteresting. I can't even bump up the rating because of chemistry, acting, or even soundtrack. There's simply nothing to recommend this film. The plot is so tame and clichéd, and yet the filmmaker does nothing special to make it seem fresh or inventive. The lead characters are uninteresting and while I don't expect young teens to generate sexual tension, I do expect them to have some chemistry or connect in such a way that makes you want to see the two together. At the expense of any real character development or even a semblance of a strong storyline, we get near-constant voice-over narration. Screen writing 101: show us, don't tell us! From the interview that Reiner gave, I understand that the original book on which the film is based was set in recent times, but Reiner decided to push it back to the early 60s. That would be OK if not for the all too modern expressions that come from the characters. The family worries about ""salmonella poisoning"" from the neighbor's eggs? Was the general public even aware of that issue in 1963? The young male lead complains about his neighbor ""stalking"" him and she in turn refers to him as being ""visually-challenged."" Had terms that those even been coined by 1963? The young teens casually throw out words like ""bullsh#$,"" ""jacksh#$,"" and say things like, ""are you freakin' mental?"" OK, I was born in the 70s so maybe these terms and phrases were common in 1963, but I can't recall any film made during that decade that had characters that sounded like these people did. Poor film overall.","

"FLIPPED","Trentflix","25 April 2011","I saw the good reviews and was excited for a family film I could enjoy without worrying about content. I can see how this would appeal to a person if they found the main characters endearing. I didn't. The girl is a flighty daisy-minded girl who will likely grow up and make beaded jewelery for a living and the typical boy will grow up to be the typical insignificant person he is working a dead-end blue collar job. There are apparent anachronisms, scenes of spectacularly unspectacular acting and the ""flipped"" visual effect that you find in bad power point presentations never gets old. Looking for the positive points though, I'll never have to watch it again.","

Therefore, he has always treated the heroine with the arguments of others, not daring to tell his true thoughts.And Julie is different. She has the courage to express her emotions. Even if she fails, she will continue to work hard. She is obsessed with what she loves and will not give up until the last moment.There are also some very beautiful sentences in the movie, like
""Some of us get dipped in flat, some in satin, some in gloss. But every once in a while you find someone who's iridescent, and when you do, nothing will ever compare. ""

"FLIPPED","GethinVanH","15 December 2010","The last good movie Rob Reiner directed was ""Misery"" in 1990, nearly 20 years ago. Since then he's been pumping out a lot of crap like ""The American President"" and ""The Bucket List"". Flipped falls into the same category. It's a movie about a suburban, middle-class white American kid who comes of age. To top it all off, I discovered that Flipped is based on a book which takes place in the 2000s. You've seen this movie if you've seen 'My Girl' or 'The Wonder Years' you've already seen this movie.American Graffiti and Hairspray are at least more challenging and add something new. 'Flipped' adds nothing new except for a dual-narrative from both the teen boy and teen girl. This is interesting but since the male character is so utterly devoid of any charisma I couldn't stand listening to him. Reiner got it right with 'Stand By Me' by using an adult narrator (Dreyfuss) who could actually handle the task. The young actors are pretty bad narrators.There's nothing new here and it's pretty much an all-white cast. This is not a time to be sentimental about with it's lack of diversity and sterile environments. Reiner had the option of having the film take place in the 2000s and obviously rejected it. He prefers to work in the cocoon which is the 1960s coming of age story.","

The thing he did with the both Julie and Bryce aspect was phenomenal! You get to see the happening from both Julie and Bryce's point of view. It was really good made! The actors were so truthful to their characters and they really became them, Julie played by Madeline Carroll and Bryce played by Callan McAuliffe did a really good job! They together, made the best of pairs, and I could see my self in Bryce so many times which was so interesting. And that's what's so cool about this movie, that I believe you can all say ""I've been there"" and see yourself in some of the characters. I didn't want it to end, I actually wanted it to be a bit longer, I wanted to see them growing up together, and see them growing old together that would've been a great ending. Not that the ending there is now was bad.. NO, it was actually really good! It's a family film which you can watch over and over again, and I highly recommend you to watch it! I give it 9/10 :)","

"FLIPPED","theinaniloquent","4 May 2012","Before I begin, I haven't read the book. So if your looking for in-depth comparisons look elsewhere. I'm hear to express my thoughts on the movie itself, and it's quality. Not the books. Thank you.Listen to me carefully: the movie is not bad. It's well-translated from the book, it's *sometimes* well-acted, and it's well-directed. The movie has loads of heart and sorts of warmheartedness. So your probably asking yourself why this film stands with his 5. Well, I'll tell you. The movie is firstly contrived. I suspected it the moment I saw it. The most unique thing the movie does is it's narrative. You're are getting the guy's side to the story but then also the girl's side. It was actually quite nice. But aside from all that sappy stuff, the movie reaches too far and ends up being formulaic. Sure. It has that unique narrative side to it, but the other side? They tried to fill it up with as much clichés as possible, and by the end, it was about to explode. Next? The movie is sometimes really badly acted. Some of it seems like the two main characters are just running through it, waiting to the get to the finish line/money. But the main thing that bugged me was two characters. One is Bryce's dad Steven Loski played by Anthony Edwards. He was a complete asshole, but his attempts at trying to be an asshole are easily laughable. He has no reason to be an asshole either, he just goes on and on and on, and you're not believing one bit of it. The next is Juli's cousin Daniel Baker. When I first saw him, I thought it was a joke. Seriously. He was apparently brain-damaged from birth? I know people like that, and it wasn't anything like that. The movie tries to express something it really can't, but it tries so I give it credit for that.. So with all that said, Flipped is just another film. The director has made some profoundly great films, but Flipped seemed to be a film made in the duration of his mid-life crisis. I was entertaining, and found the movie had potential, but it didn't do anything new. And new is good. So the movie was bad.. Anyways, I recommend the movie for people who aren't too biased on movies that aren't trying to be something it's not. But, for me, this movie just doesn't do it. 5/10.","

"FLIPPED","PandoraProductions4","17 August 2015","Flipped is one of those gems that slip by, comparatively unnoticed. Slammed by critics upon it's initial release, it was a box office failure, barely making one fourteenth of it's budget. Years later, it has garnered a small but loyal following. The fact is, the movie is very good. One of 2010's best. It's not a standard teen flick, it occurs on the threshold of adolescence. Bryce and Juli are longtime neighbours. Juli has been obsessed with Bryce for years, but Bryce has never been interested in her. The movie's title is clever. As Bryce begins to become more keen on Juli, so she begins to lose interest in him. So they flip in their opinions of one another, basically. Being told from two perspectives- Bryce's and Juli's, adds to the ""flipped"" aspect. It's highly entertaining to see how their interpretations of the same events are different. Callan McAuliffe, who plays Bryce actually looks like a kid from the 50's (which is the movie's setting). Madeline Carroll's as cute as a button, and also gives a great performance. Unusual for a kids movie, the adult characters are also quite nicely fleshed out. It's Rob Reiner's best movie since ""A Few Good Men"". The themes of friendship,family, loss, and love make this moving picture...well, moving. I can only hope that more people discover this movie. Spread the word!","

"FLIPPED","BeneCumb","11 September 2013","Although my (pre-)teen years were decades ago, it is sometimes nice to remind and compare - in particular, if script and directing are good. In Flipped, it is so indeed, plus a good choice of child actors provides additional value to the movie. Unlike many youth films made in this century, the story here focuses on human values, generation ties, friendship etc, not on ""cuteness"" or being popular on account of personal wealth. The two neighboring families depicted are different (creative vs. formal), and those differences bring interesting angles and twists into the storyline. The cast is evenly strong as well, the grown-up characters are performed by Rebecca De Mornay, Anthony Edwards, John Mahoney, Penelope Ann Miller, Aidan Quinn... The latter was the most interesting to me and his presence on screen was more frequent as well. Kevin Weisman performs a small, but very difficult role of a retarded person.Recommended to all families with children, although contemporary minor might consider the events as too naive from distant past... But family life can be without constant swearing, drugs, sexual hints etc. as well.","

"FLIPPED","GeneralUrsus","23 May 2011","From the opening frames this film had a cloying, cutesy ersatz sweetness that was annoying. The movie's look and feel resembles a television episode. Flipped which is based on a novel seems like a watered down, rip-off of television's The Wonder Years. However this material is neither funny, heartwarming or memorable on any level.The acting across the boards is stilted, forced and borders on caricature particularly from Anthony Edwards as a belligerent father who's abusive qualities stem from his unfulfilled desires to be a musician. The only decent performance in the film is from character actor John Mahoney. His sweet, endearing portrayal as a grandfather is honest, moving and presents the only flowering hope that this film might blossom.What really destroys this film though is the constant use of narration. At least 80% of the movie is narrated in dull, garbled monologues from both of the two main characters. Another major flaw is the endless ping- pong, story telling device where we see the same scene over again from the perspective of each of the two main characters.We witness entire passages of this film devoted to nonsensical issues like whether or not to eat the neighbor's farm fresh eggs because they might be tainted by salmonella. The film does not draw us in, the characters are bland, the situations are ridiculous and the pacing is monotonous. I have seen Folger's Coffee Commercials that were more uplifting than this drivel. For me Flipped flopped.","

"FLIPPED","tomdude0","8 June 2011","UPDATE: I read the book, and I compared the two. I'm going to do something daring and say that the movie was better. Something about the movie was more innocent, and there was a sense of finality at the end. The book was excellent, but something about the movie was just...better. Anyways, here's the original review.Flipped is about the romantic relationship between two kids, Bryce and Juli. When Bryce first moves into the neighborhood, Juli instantly becomes obsessed with him and keeps this obsession going for over half a decade. Bryce, however, feels that she's a pest and constantly tries to avoid her. But eventually the story ""flips""--Bryce starts having feelings for Juli and tries to express them.Overall, the story was great. The setting was changed from the more modern setting of the book to the late '50s and early '60s because back then it was harder to get hold of someone, making the whole romantic situation more awkward. There was one thing that confused me a little, but I won't say it because it'd spoil an important point in the story. If you're paying really close attention you'll notice it.The acting was great, Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe are definitely two to watch. I still remember that Subway commercial that Madeline did and she's grown a lot. The two do have a lot of chemistry and they portray the awkwardness of romance and just being a teenager very well. For the most part, character development was good. Some of the minor characters weren't developed as well, but hey, they're minor characters for a reason.I think the ending was the most beautiful part. I wasn't expecting it at all, and it was really moving. There's a reason this movie won the Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award.I've watched this movie multiple times, and every time I find myself with a huge grin that I just can't seem to get rid of afterwards. I can't get enough of it. I guess you could say I flipped over Flipped.","

The thought narration is a bit much sometimes. 90% of the film is filled with their thoughts which can be quite hindering. But I can overlook that and enjoy the storyline just the same.It's about a girl who has a childhood crush on a boy who lived across from her house. She keeps on stalking him (a bit weird to think about, especially if we think in a reversed gender role, but I vouch kids had done it out when they were kids, I was one). It captures that young love where we obsess about our crush and fantasize a whole lot more which makes them look attractive than the reality, and when reality revealed itself, we realize they're just a normal person like us. I love that, because it's relatable.The movie has a happy ending. They are together, showing them planting a tree together.","

This movie though I couldn't get into as much as I really wanted to. The thought that continuously crept into my head was how big of an arrogant a-hole Bryce was. He is the stereotypical douche that we all knew in high school who was mean and rude to people because he thought it made him look cool. Then finally he decides what he wants and thinks he deserves it. Goes the whole movie being just a crappy person then decides he wants juli now and decides he will start being nice to get what he wants.I get what they were trying to do with this movie but I think the execution was poorly done. Especially with Bryce's character.In conclusion there will be plenty of people that will love the movie but I couldn't get over my hatred of Bryce and his character to enjoy this movie.","

"FLIPPED","aayush-mudgal","16 August 2014","Flipped is a unique coming of age romantic comedy movie based on the novel ""Flipped"" by W. Draanen. The movie captures a beautiful transition and flip in nature of two second graders. It's a bit too Wonder Years at times, but the odd two-narrators gimmick plays right into the film's ""flip"" in structure.It's a surprising-engaging and beautifully-told story about young romance though being static for few moments in the middle. The story revolves around Bryce Loski and Juli Baker, young children who are brought together with the strong bond of love. Juli falls in love at first sight with Bryce who has a weird feeling of attraction and isn't too sure of his love for her. From the very first day he tries to keep her away, at times insulting her and letting her down, but she is never angered or agitated.. She repeatedly tries to forget his behavior, but it's when this stacks up so high, and she feels that she might be wrong for him that at this time, Bryce starts experiencing a deep sense of love and affection towards her. He repeatedly tries to contact her, talk to her, and makes all possible attempts and pleads her for forgiveness. But when she realizes that Bryce has redeemed himself, they both share a smile and continue and hold each other's hand. This flip of minds is beautifully portrayed in the movie.It's through their experiences that they get to know about themselves and about each other. Despite being opposite in all sense they both fall in love with each other.The importance of understanding varying perspectives is always worth communicating, and Flipped, despite its cloying approach, manages to deliver this idea with a decent amount of sincerity intact.If you want a ultimately feel-good film about young love, this is a movie to watch. !","

"FLIPPED","LitCritChas","7 March 2011","I picked up the film when I found it on sale in a Blockbuster that was having a ""going out of business"" sale. I was not dissatisfied with what I bought in the least. It was both a cathartic and feel-good film all at once. Through watching it, you can be transported back to that time when you had your own first crush and were that guy or girl with a crush. It also did a beautiful job of showing the maturation which occurs from the initial crush to the actual budding of love. I felt the challenges set forth in testing the character strengths of both protagonists and pushing them to become better individuals and partners for one another. Rob Reiner did a wonderful job in direction and casting prodding the actors to grow and develop in a realistic manner over the course of the film. The supporting adult cast was well cast and artfully played, giving subtleties that made me appreciate them & their handiwork. They also developed their characters in a manner that didn't distract from the main protagonists. I wish the same could be said about the other young teenage actors who almost all came out as cardboard cut-out stereotypes that have been rehashed from young teenage movie to young teenage movie.Now for my nitpicks: An interesting thing I noticed was that Rob Reiner takes the novel out of the time period it was originally set in: 1994 - 2000 and puts it instead in the ever nostalgic 1957 - 1963 time period (when he himself was the age of the protagonists). After discovering this directorial choice: the two issues I had with the film were immediately explained and made sense.First, the critique of government run facilities that exists in the film wasn't as vocal at the time. I'm sure it existed, but overall there was a general trust of the government & its facilities--the expansion of which through the New Deal had just helped the nation get through the Great Depression & WWII--or at least that's what the commonly held belief was at the time. It isn't until the fallout from Carter's presidency & the emergence of the Reagan Revolution that this trend would be reversed--and a distrust of government facilities would begin to appear and become more popular. So the 1994 - 2000 setting of the book makes the existence of this critique make complete sense in a way that a 1957 - 1963 setting of the film does not.My second nitpick was with the incongruity of names with the generations. Grandpa Chet would work out to be in the book part of the same cohort as Lynetta, Skylar (a name that according to most name graphs indicates wasn't used in the US until the 1980s--when the original character in the book would've been born), Matt, & Mark have been ""aged back"" to--i.e. he was born in the book during the early - mid 1940s as his name suggests. It also wasn't just Chet & Skylar but nearly all of the other characters who had names that were less popular during the time period the film was recast in (for their specific generations) than in the original time period of the book. However I doubt most people would notice such minute details or even care about them, not when presented with such a heart-warming coming of age story set to some of the best music Doo Wop has given us.Overall, I'd say that you really have to nitpick (like I did) to find fault with Flipped--or be a confirmed cynic.","

Truly an uplifting an humorous film, which reminds us all of how great life can be when we keep things in perspective. This one is now part of my collection, as is any Rob Reiner film.I loved the story of us and am always amazed at this filmmaker's in depth understanding of both human complexity and humor. It is the story that makes the film and this is a must see example of such!Heart, love, life are consistent themes for this filmmaker, thank God.

"FLIPPED","sabrinatheblogster","24 January 2014","The thing with this movie is: it's a decent story but it's wrong on so many levels.First of all, in the story these kids don't age beyond, what, twelve? They should not be thinking about love. They should be thinking about having fun, being creative, doing things, making friends, and so on. This drama does not fit into the lives of such young people. It's not romantic, it's unhealthy.Second, when a guy stalks a girl like that it's creepy, but when a girl stalks a guy like that it's cute? Geez talk about double standards, let alone the message this sends out to young people. Just chase a person long enough and he/she will fall for you eventually. Spoiler: that's not the way it works, folks. If he or she is just not that into you, move on. Also, don't stalk people. It's wrong, mmkay? And take no for an answer, mmkay? Aaaaand don't go secretly sniffing people, no matter if you're a boy or a girl, and no matter if he/she smells like water melon, cheese sticks, or old books. Just don't. do. it. It's f*cking creepy and NOT cute. Mmkay? Third, as one of the plus sides, this movie totally made me discover something about myself. When they have the Boy Auction - or whatever (again, at that age?! And holy sh*t, talk about shallow standards) - there's a boy being auctioned as the first of them all. He seems so very uninteresting but then we find out he's carrying a basket with chicken salad sandwiches, onion dip, and cherry pie. That's when I went: 'hell that's my kind of guy. I'd date him.' So there's that standard, reaffirmed by the next scene where Bryce asks the blonde if they can please talk about something else than tans or food. Tans, yes, but food? You no like to talk about food? Go f*ck yourself, Bryce Lovski, food is awesome. How boring is he? Also, 'Bryce Lovski'? Does anyone notice the resemblance with 'Kyle Brovlovski'? South Park fantasy maybe? Last but not least, in the last scene Julie goes 'and then, for the first time we really talked' (or something). Why on earth would you chase a guy for so many years if you don't even feel like you've had a decent conversation with him? It's so stupid my vocabulary doesn't even suffice to describe it.Stupid movie, stupid priorities, stupid standards, loved the food.","

"FLIPPED","A_Different_Drummer","24 October 2016","Reviewers' Notes: 1. A number of mainstream reviews noted that this was Reiner's most ambitious project in almost two decades. That is a ""back-handed compliment: and it is as much a comment on how he has been coasting for years, as it is a nod to this specific effort.2. The flaws in the film are -- ironically -- typified in the official poster for the project, where the artwork has the two leads sitting in the (infamous) tree on the same branch. Of course in the actual story they are never actually together in the tree. For film buffs of the future, this raises the question of whether the script was rewritten (and no one told the promo dept); or if simply someone inside the production company was trying to express what the film should have been...? 3. On the plus side, it is remarkable how much mileage Reiner gets from the shopworn devices of voice-over and double-POV. That the viewer comes to expect and get involved with these tricks is a big plus.4. The supporting cast is solid but not solid enough to overcome any shortcomings in the performances from the two young leads. The good news? There are no such shortcomings! The two young leads essentially pick up the film on their backs and carry it to the finish line.5. Reminded me in some ways of the original Korean MY SASSY GIRL (recommended!) which remains the most powerful rom-com of the last few decades. And that is not merely a back-handed compliment, that is the real deal. To suggest that love can blossom in such unlikely circumstances is, at the end of the day, what makes this film memorable.","

"FLIPPED","dishlady69","14 August 2017","Rob Reiner's nostalgic romcom doesn't quite hit the mark the way his other films have. While the movie does convey the general awkwardness of being a teenager in the 1950s. Unfortunately, it also drags out the ignorance of a generation out along with it. Rebecca De Mornay and John Mahoney are thankfully around to save us all from the overwhelming ignorance conveyed by Anthony Edwards (who loses quite a few brownie points in my book for taking this part in the first place).Madeline Carroll is an incredible find, though her character is a little overdone, and Callan McAuliffe is convincing as the awkward teen as he most likely had just survived his awkward teens when cast for the film. It's a film you REALLY WANT to like if you're a fan of Reiner's work, but in general the film drags on a little too much, highlighting comments of VAST ignorance that the mixed audience viewing the film with me found very offensive.","

"FLIPPED","eightyproofsunshinefilms","29 July 2011","So I had this on my ON DEMAND queue for about a week. I was afraid to watch it because the blurb that describes the film made it sound, well really stupid. Plus I thought it spanned over like a whole lifetime not just into 8th grade. It reminded me of Winnie and Kevin from Wonder Years, which I always loved and still miss to this day and wish it would come on DVD. This film had those tender moments and connection between the two kids. Basically 2nd grade new boy moves into neighborhood and girl across the street instantly falls for him just by his sparkling eyes. The boy well he doesn't feel the same way of course. The film moves on to 6th grade where the girl is still gaga and fawning over the boy who gets a girlfriend just to detract from the Girl's obsession. That begins to make them grow apart. Then you begin to get to know the kids as individuals and their families. Each family has kind of a BEHIND DOORS ONLY life and it is things people could relate to. Finally the boy realizes he has feelings for the girl and she has decided she hates him. So to make a long story short and not divulge too many spoilers, it brings it back to the point of will they or won't they. I can remember being a tween and then a teen and those first feelings of ""puppy"" love or real love as teenagers always feel it is. I also had no idea it was filmed in Michigan and being a Michigan filmmaker myself it made me happy to see something so touching being made here. Plus well Rob Reiner usually makes a good film. All in all I highly recommend this film for anyone having a bad day that just needs to see something that kinda makes you nostalgic and remember butterflies.","

"FLIPPED","ElliesWonder","27 September 2017","An unusual romantic story, finally there is a fresh good one different from Hollywood's 'sickness porn' - rebellious teenagers either love bad or love vampire, mystery. This puppy love definitely refreshed my eyes! Their warm heartening love was developed with logic, the flipped went with the flow, it has nothing like a crazy drama. Yet this romantic story still captured my eyes with its heartwarming moments.Besides the movie storyline, this movie really shows the difference between boys and girls inequality in mental maturity. I remembered I watched a video about an experiment, tester made some terrible taste juice and asked kids' options with a guilty face because of her terrible cooking skills; the experiment reflects the difference between boys and girls in young age 3-5 years old. Boys would honestly speak the truth of nasty taste, yet girls would show their compassion in young age, they would try to comfort the tester that her drink wasn't too terrible at all. That experiment was interesting, it just shows that girl naturally has better social skills development compared to the boy.Therefore Juli started her consciousness in age 7, and experienced some thoughtful thoughts about the ""complete painting view"" in her young age, and in the same age arrange, the boy, Bryce Losk just flipped. Luckily Bryce found the good of Juli, and hold her hands at the end.","

For Juli Baker and Bryce Loski, a childhood crush was life or death. With that, Flipped is a lovable story about your childhood love and perhaps the judgements you make about people before you really know them, something everyone is guilty of when you're young. The bow that gets wrapped at the end doesn't necessarily feel earned, but it's a pretty sweet little film that not many have seen, and that should change.7.0/10","

The reason why he was that way was not explored enough (the subplot surrounding his father) to forgive or even try to understand his behaviour. Juli was a beautifully spirited character and the film followed her journey of realising that Bryce was not all she first saw in him. Therefore, the ending was out of place, and frankly a bit of a cop out.I came for a wholesome coming of age film and left feeling empty and like I'd wasted my time.","

"FLIPPED","mysteryfan04","7 January 2011","If any three words were to describe Flipped, those words would be 'sweet', 'simple', and 'likable.' It's too light to be fully memorable, but it is endearing enough to enjoy. Bryce and Juli are two neighbors whose parents don't think too highly of each other. They've grown up together, and she had a crush on him throughout elementary school. Now that they're in middle school, they finally have the guts to tell each other how they really feel. But many events, such as those involving a sycamore tree and a hatch of chicks, mess with all of their emotions. Are they really into each other? Will their love last? The journey to the answers to these questions is sometimes awkward but still interesting. Rob Reiner's directing style suits the film well, but the script contains too many awkward moments which can distract from the sweetness of the film. The narration of the protagonists eventually becomes grating and excessive. The movement of the setting from the 2000s to the 1960s causes the film to feel too safe and clichéd. As a result, the movie wouldn't be nearly as enjoyable without Madeline Caroll and Callan McAuliffe in the two lead roles. Their chemistry really is lasting, and their performances are really sensitive and emotional. Caroll's scene in the sycamore tree will leave you affected to the right degree. McAuliffe does a great job of portraying a sensitive but determined character eager to set things right, even though he is not brave enough to express his actual emotions. The music and score are also brilliantly crafted and fun to listen to. Flipped may not live up to its beloved source novel, but it is a charming and entertaining film.","

The cast, the production, the story line, the ambient feel seem to work together so well. The girl looked weird and annoying in the first scenes but eventually she will grow on you as story going. I saw some comments about the choice for 50's-60's theme was unnecessary. I totally disagree. It is the major part of what made this movie so heartwarming. It would not have worked in present time line. No girls would feed her chicken in the backyard. The boy would not have been so nice to her even if he does not like her. In these days, if you annoyed a girl you just post something to embarrass her in social networks or just try to take advantage of her. So it is a solid reason to go back in much nicer time. I think the only thing it needed to be changed is the name. I missed this flick for years just because the name ""Flipped"" was not appealing enough to me.","

Rob Reiner co-wrote and directed, it is set in the late 1950s then the early 1960s, 1963 to be exact, the year I graduated from high school. The characters seemed pretty authentic to the period.It is a story about a small boy whose family moves to a new neighborhood, and he is immediately befriended by a small girl his age that lives across the street. We learn later that she was taken by his eyes, his gaze, and immediately liked him. But as bold as the girl was, the boy was shy. She always told things as they were, he often evaded the truth because it seemed easier. At different points she doesn't ever want to talk to him again, or he doesn't ever want to see her again. As budding relationships often experience. Madeline Carroll plays the girl at about 13, Juli Baker. Australian actor Callan McAuliffe plays the boy, Bryce Loski, at the same age. Most of the story is told at that period of time when they were junior high students.It is a wonderful cast overall, with the likes of Rebecca De Mornay, Anthony Edwards, Penelope Ann Miller, and Aidan Quinn as parents and John Mahoney as a grandparent. Good family movie, very sweet in spots, and mostly very realistic.","

"FLIPPED","fernandoschiavi","6 October 2023","The word ""flipped"" has several definitions in almost any online dictionary - most of them relating to turning something over, throwing something, turning pages, and so on. However, this Rob Reiner film of the same name refers to the traditional use of the word, meaning ""to get excited about something you find attractive."" With only one successful film since the mid-1990s - and that being the forced and contrived cancer comedy ""Before We Go"" - Rob Reiner appears to be trying to recapture his mojo with ""Flipped,"" a return to the coming-of-age film, sometimes painful and sometimes moving, which he accomplished so splendidly in his 1986 film ""Stand by Me.""But what was seemingly easy more than two decades ago is now a struggle. Reiner once again demonstrates compassion and insight into young people's struggles to gain self-knowledge, but in his new film, clearly overly fictional characters and forced situations overwhelm his story. ""Flipped"" is a great addition to the coming-of-age genre, I believe it will join the ranks of other favorites like ""Stand by Me"" and ""Goodbye, Boys"", although perhaps not as quickly. Anyone who grew up in the era will no doubt identify with this near-flawless depiction of life in early 1960s America. But the attraction doesn't stop there, because the story is universal: Flipped, crushes and everything that accompanies them, are things that everyone can identify with at any age. It is part of human history. It has the same timeless feel as the recent cinematic release ""Ramona and Beezus"" in terms of its positive nostalgia appeal, but with much more depth as this film is aimed at adults as well as young people.Reiner co-wrote ""Flipped"" with Andrew Scheinman (producer of ""A Matter of Honor"") based on the novel of the same name written by Wendelin Van Draanen and, with his inimitable directorial style (""Stand by Me,"" ""Before Leave""), Reiner managed to involve the audience in a touching story that awakens many emotions and some tears. Without revealing anything about this very predictable plot, I can say that Reiner manages to incorporate the connotations of ""Flipped"" in several ways that give the film psychological intensity. There are clever montage sequences that outline the unrequited love that develops between the main character, Bryce Loski (new rising star Callan McAuliffe), and the girl Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll, ""The Spy Who Knew Too Little""). Who lived in the house opposite him at 243 Bonnie Meadow Lane. Each scene is brilliantly filmed by Thomas Del Ruth and expertly edited by Robert Leighton.The film begins in first grade in the late 1950s and quickly reaches eighth grade in the year 1963, where the rising action gets into full swing. What sets this film apart from many others of its kind, one of the many things that make it truly valuable, are the interesting back-and-forth narratives of each character, recreating the same scenes (with uniquely different perspectives and settings) but from their own ""he said, she said"" perspectives, all of which remain faithful to the book (albeit rewritten in the '60s setting by Reiner). The emphasis on editing to represent these transitions is original and incredible. The fluidity of this cohesive cast speaks not only to their acting talents and Reiner's excellent direction, but also to the articulate casting choices made by Janet Hirshenson and Jane Jenkins.This is a film we all already know. The girl has had a crush on the boy since first grade. The boy doesn't care much about her, but he can't avoid her because she lives across the street from her house. The girl is a dreamer, determined, with a captivating love for life. The boy resists the urge to follow this dream with her or to join her in the highest branches of the neighborhood tree - which becomes the metaphor for the rest of the film. The tree is the place without prejudice, where clarity of vision brings truth, insight and purpose to live. The grandfather on the left enters the scene; he suggests to the boy that there may be more to this girl than is on the cover - talking about the girl. The boy is now a growing teenager who really messed things up, but now he changes and is actually interested. Your grandfather said, ""Some of us are painted with flat paint, some with satin paint, some with glossy paint. But every now and then, you find someone who is iridescent, and when you do, nothing else compares."" The grandfather was remembering his late wife when he said this, but the boy takes it seriously. The question is: is it too late to conquer it?There's a narrative device in Rob Reiner and Andrew Scheinman's script, based on Wendelin Van Draanan's novel, that could be tiresome, but works here because it's been carefully thought out. The film's key events are seen from both points of view: Bryce's and Juli's.Teenagers often fall out of step emotionally, and these two need John Philip Sousa. There are no tricks: the scenes play out as they seem, and not in alternate universes. But they look so different depending on who is seeing them. Reiner sets most of the film in 1963 (his classic ""Stand by Me"" takes place a few years earlier, in 1959), and it's probably not just out of nostalgia. In some ways, this is the last year of American teenage innocence, before the 1960s took over. Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe, who seem incredibly vulnerable, are sincere and pure, and are characters we believe can be hurt. Some of today's teenagers are more wounded and cynical than their parents ever were. And for some of them, sex is not an unexplored land. Perhaps what makes ""Flipped"" so charming is how it recreates a life we wished we had when we were 14. This is true for adults, and I also suspect it is true for some 14-year-olds. In a way, the audience also ""goes back in time"".The good script is one of the great merits of the work. It's interesting the way the story is shaped, always showing the point of view of the boy and the girl, going back and forth in time, and even showing the same events, the change in point of view gives us the chance to build alongside of the characters and their feelings, gives us the chance to see the plot from a much bigger perspective than its own protagonists, the only ones who don't understand that they deserve to be together. And just as Juli's father says at a certain point, that it is necessary to look at the landscape, the sum of all the parts, not the isolated elements, ""Flipped"" is precisely that, the sum of these looks, of parts of the same story and the result is simply magical, enchanting. I also like how nostalgia works in the work, not only in what is produced in the viewer, but it is also what motivates some of its characters' actions, such as the friendship that arises between Chet and the neighbor who reminds him of his love when more young, or when Bryce's father falls silent when he sees the promising musicians, making it clear that it was the life he left behind to support his family, it is as if these individuals were, in a way, stuck in the past, ironically, in this period film. And this affects us too, we want to be trapped there too, not exactly at the time, but in the phase of life portrayed, where things were easier, where the height of our afflictions was when we would have our first kiss.Even though the film touches on more mature issues like economic hardship, class conflict, disability and parental regret, it's a much sweeter story suitable for all ages than ""Stand by Me."" And though it quickly evolves into a new take on the old boy-meets-girl premise, ""Flipped"" begins innocently enough as an ""awkward Flipped"" story when Bryce Loski (Callan McAuliffe) moves into the house across the street from Lovely but tireless Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll). However, rather than relying on the safe combination of '60s American Bandstand hits and warm-toned, static cinematography, Reiner shows respect for his young audience by illustrating the differences in background, perspective, and the separate hormonal rollercoasters experienced by its main characters. Sentimental without being corny, ""Flipped"" uses the feeling of nostalgic purity in a way that doesn't neglect the importance of a solid foundation in plot and characters to appeal to contemporary children. This one is much more tender and reflective than most child-centric films. An honest and timeless story about boy meeting girl and all the ups, downs, misunderstandings and memorable lessons that come along with it, ""Flipped"" is a captivating film well worth seeing.Enjoying the complexity of contradictory feelings and generational issues, we experience the film visually through the eyes and aurally through the teenagers' narrated thoughts, through one-at-a-time interpretations of key events that occur in their changing relationship over the course of a few years. Director Rob Reiner's bold adaptation of Wendelin van Draanen's emphasizes the vital lesson that not only are there at least two sides to every story, but also that it is impossible to fully understand another person's ""side"" without putting yourself in their shoes. Winner of the Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award, this work that appeals to several generations reaffirms Rob Reiner's role as a director of actors. The young cast members are supported every step of the way by Anthony Edwards as a bitter father, John Mahoney as a widowed grandfather who feels that Bryce's relationship with the girl across the street may echo what he shared with his real deceased love, along with good performances from Penelope Ann Miller, Aidan Quinn and Rebecca DeMornay.""Flipped"" is a film that avoids clichés and stereotypes typical of teen films. Instead, he addresses deeper issues, such as social and family differences, and the importance of understanding another's point of view. It's a story about growing up, learning to see beyond appearances and discovering the true meaning of love.","

"FLIPPED","fredrikgunerius","2 January 2024","Rob Reiner returns to his roots in this simple coming-off age romance about two neighbouring kids growing up on each side of a typical suburban American street in the late 1950s. The title, Flipped, refers to both a development in the male protagonist and to the film's clever narrative style, in which the set of events are told twice, alternatingly from the boy's and the girl's point of view. This may feel exhausting at first glance, but the formula grows on you, and Reiner knows how to utilize the opportunity it creates to sprinkle the story with amusing observations and angles. The story itself is simple, a classic tale of youth and love, but as Reiner rediscovers the at times magical atmosphere from films such as Stand By Me and couples this with beautiful cinematography and sympathetic performances from a fine acting ensemble, Flipped is able to stand out from the crowd and ultimately evoke real emotion despite its somewhat predictable outcome. It's a pleasant film with its heart in the right place. The only thing that doesn't work quite as well as one could have hoped, is the dialogue, which doesn't always seem adjusted for the 1950s.*Review written in 2011.","

"FLIPPED","saadgkhan","19 December 2010","FLIPPED – CATCH IT ( B+ ) Flipped is a simple, charming & adorable story about two teens in a he-said she-said style where both characters alternately presents their perspective on a shared set of events. I loved the whole idea; it brought the utmost needed freshness to teens movies. Its really sweet how the movie progresses and in the beginning Boy ""Bryce"" (Callan McAuliffe) running away from Julie (Callan McAuliffe) though as the time passes by Julie starts to cut off from Bryce & Bryce falls head over heels for her. The best part of the movie was Two sides of the story, that's how we know what was actually happening in both teens head while certain seats of events were happening. I have never seen anything like that before and it was really fascinating for me. Callan McAuliffe and Madeline Carroll brought the utmost freshness on screen. Callan McAliffe and Madeline Carroll are defiantly the stars of tomorrow. They were sweet, lovable and adorable, if we couldn't relate to the characters the movie would have fallen on its face because obviously it's all about emotions, thoughts and feeling on very simple story line. Morgan Lilly as young Julie was the cutest thing on planet. All the supporting cast was simply great and the cinematography was awesome. There were few little things here and there which could have been better, for example I didn't find Bryce's mother very convincing as an actress plus in the entire movie the Julie waits & dreams about kissing Bryce but that kiss never happens though in the end Julie did say ""that he was still walking around with her first kiss, but not for long"" but still if they would have shown the kiss, it would have more impact. Nonetheless few flaws here and there it was one of the most charming movies of 2010 and I can't wait to see it again.","

"FLIPPED","KnightsofNi11","13 July 2011","After a less than impressive run of films from 1999 to 2005 I think Rob Reiner may be gaining back some of his lovable and charming talent he laid out in the 80's. Flipped is his most recent effort and it is a nostalgic look at the simpler times of a complicated adolescence. The film is told through the perspective of two eighth graders who begin to have feelings for each other after a long and complicated relationship that began in second grade. Part of the story will be told through the eyes and narration of Bryce Lovski and then we will see the same events reoccur from the perspective of Juli Baker. The film is practically overflowing with nostalgia, but it is also a sincerely heartwarming tale of love and growing up.My perception of the early 60's time period seen here has formed solely through movies I've seen and stories I've heard, but I really do feel like Reiner has captured the positive side of this time period so well. He combines it with the innocence of adolescence along with the complexity of growing up and has made a film that feels very personal and obviously means something to Reiner. And I feel like the emotions which this nostalgia brought about in him were transferred excellently to me and I felt a kind of honest sincerity coming through the atmosphere of this film.What's so pleasantly satisfying about this film is its utter devotion to its story. It tells such a meaningful and human tale of two lovable characters. This is a movie that tells the age old story of two unlikely people falling in love, but with such a unique twist. The narrative is different and fleshes out the story very well, and the story is not just a love story. It's a story about growing up and it emphasizes the influence of those around us. Flipped has a great supporting cast of characters, all different and special. They all influence our two main characters in their own ways, all possessing some sort of meaningful life lessons or words of wisdom. This is a pattern that is a little melodramatic but fits in place with this coming of age tale in a way that doesn't make it seem ridiculous or forced.This is a film that fits a specific kind of mood. It's sweet but idealized, honest but preachy. But it delivers what it has to offer in respectful moderation so I don't feel like I'm having emotional responses crammed down my throat. Flipped is a film we've seen before but not like this. The funny thing is I really didn't want to love this film, and yet I couldn't help myself. Rob Reiner films are becoming my guilty pleasure with films like this, The Bucket List, and When Harry Met Sally. I have to confess that I enjoyed Flipped so much. It is a very well done film with enough charm and wit to put a heartwarming smile on anybody's face.","

"FLIPPED","mieriks","6 October 2023","This movie, about two eighth-graders who start to have feelings for each other despite being total opposites, is a great romance movie!It was mostly good in terms of technical aspects. Some lighting issues here and there, but I really enjoyed the camerawork. The production design, which took us back to the 50s and 60s, was convincing.The story is the essential element here. The story isn't worth much without good actors, and the actors were very impressive. They convinced us with their performances and they pulled you right into their moments. I'm not sure if I was too satisfied with how the movie told the story of a sequence twice, one by Julianna ""Juli"" Baker and one by Bryce Loski. It was obvious that the movie tried to show the perspective from both of the characters, but it kind of felt repetitive and unnecessary sometimes because it wasn't difficult to guess what the other character felt when we got the perspective of the first character. I think this technique would have fit more in a complex and psychological story. However, since the story itself was the strong part, it never got boring. It's a cute child story about first love and family relationships that highlights the importance of not just the cover, but also the inside that determines the whole package. These elements are relatable to all of us, and it can truly remind you of the important things in life.This is a charming romance movie about two eighth-graders who fall for each other despite their differences. The story is told through the perspectives of both characters, which can be repetitive at times, but the story itself is strong and engaging.

Rob Reiner has directed so many terrific movies (The Princess Bride, When Harry Met Sally, Stand By Me, The Bucket List ...) that my hopes were high for this one - but what a letdown.The plot is cheaply melodramatic, and the acting (despite a strong ""name"" cast) is shallow and uninteresting, The usually excellent Anthony Edwards does a paint-by-numbers portrayal of an angry dad. Only John Mahoney, who played the dad on ""Frasier,"" is worth watching from an acting standpoint.The story is painted in such broad and simplified strokes (by both the screenwriters and the actors) that I can only conclude this movie was intended for young teenagers. I wish that had been mentioned in the promotional blurb, so my wife and I wouldn't have wasted an hour and a half watching it (she feels the same way). We kept thinking that the ""good"" parts of the movie must be coming later ... but they never arrived.If you are older than about 13, I strongly recommend you steer clear of this piece of claptrap.","

At first I liked how each kid gave their own perspective of the events that unfolded, but ultimately this became cliche, repetitive, and ridden with fowl language. The two teens and most of the adult cast are fine actors - but this was a poorly executed project.Teenage boy meets a girl next door in the 1950s and his feelings aren't solidified.

"FLIPPED","u-18005","28 March 2023","The director of ""Flipped"" is ingenious in everyone's characterization . Every character in the film is very distinct , and the film characters are not absolutely perfect , even everyone has their own defects , and it is because of these defects that we feel these characters vivid and real . ""Some of us get dipped in flat , some in stain , some in gloss . But every once in a while you find someone who's iridescent , and when you do , nothing will ever compare . That's what I remember most from this movie . It seems to tell the ignorant love story between a young man and a young girl, but in fact it is more to show the best side of humanity in front of the audience. We can see that there are a lot of contradictions and disputes in the film, but that doesn't stop the director from trying to keep warm love throughout the film. On the contrary, these contradictions and disputes make the theme of the film more profound. I think, no matter in which century, love is an eternal theme. ""Flipped"" this film says that love is not only the love we see the hero and heroine of love, the range of love is very large, heartache is not only people, perhaps is a kind of taste, a kind of feeling.......
This ""flipped"" is not love at first sight , just a moment of heart resonance, soul tremor. It suddenly happened, may also suddenly disappear, leaving only the taste of the heart of the moment. It is difficult to say that the occurrence of ""flipped"" is easy to say. Art needs to be pious, honest to oneself and sincere to others. Such artistic creation can make oneself and others ""flipped"". Juli Baker in the film is because of such a frank and undisguised character, to attract Bryce, and also won the love of Bryce's grandfather. If we were like Bryce's dad in the movie, we might never have the ""flipped"" feeling, and without it, our creation would be lifeless. In addition, in the film, when Julie Baker tells Bryce that she thinks sycamores are beautiful, Bryce dismisses her. She said to Bryce, ""I pity you for not being able to see beauty."" Indeed, art comes from life. Are we sensitive enough to capture the beauty in our lives? Can we perceive? Can you have a ""flipped"" with every bit of life?","

This is a great piece of scripting, directing and editing, as you see significant events between the two twice. Once through the eyes of each with often different recollections. The younger Juli is played charmingly by Morgan Lily. The older one, around 13-14 played by Madeline Carroll steals the show. Carroll has true acting chops and one would hope that there will be opportunities for her in Hollywood. Callan McAuliffe is an absurdly handsome young man as Bryce, Juli's obsession. He conveys Bryce's feelings well and he takes you back to that age convincingly. He is a confused adolescent, trying to fit in and please everybody. The rest of the cast is first-rate led by old pro John Mahoney of ""Frazier"" as Bryce's grandfather. Juli's parents are played nicely by Aidan Quinn and Penelope Ann Miller. Bryce's mom is Rebecca DeMornay and his unlikable dad is played well by Anthony Edwards. How nice to see a movie with characters I care about. A nice little yarn.","

It can get tiring every now and then, but for the most part it works, highlighting how feelings get in the way and alter our perception of reality - kinda what happens to Tom in (500) Days of Summer and to the viewer with him, as we see events only from his unreliable perspective.","

I suddenly discovered that if I was twelve or three years old, I could not help but think that this girl was probably ""ill"". A girl climbing such a tall tree was dangerous and rude. I think I would also talk to her friends around me and hate her, but I would not understand her. You see, how ironic, I think the girls in the film are beautiful and romantic, and the boys are mediocre and boring, but if this plot does not happen in the movie but in life, I will become as distasteful as a boy girl.

I saw a part of myself in there, and I'm sure viewers will somehow relate to the film as well. We all fell in love; some of us very young, some even a little late. But the point is you fell in love the first time and you won't forget the feeling . . . ever.And what makes Flipped even more beautiful is that shines a light on family. It somehow explains why parents behave like they do, why some of them are cold and bitter, forgiving and kind.Flipped is a feel-good movie sure to give you a trip down memory lane.","

As shown through the beginning of the film, they develope feelings for each other and go through events.In Flipped, we follow through Juli and Bryce's narrations. Story's told from their perspective. The writers perfectly presented how a teenager's (or in this case, teenagers) mindset of falling in love is like.Now it does become draggy towards the second act, in which it feels like a family movie more than a romance one. The narration could also be reduced a little. On a technical aspect though, Flipped is a well crafted picture with the decent direction and unique colour-grading.Despite some minor flaws, Flipped is still a warm little entertainment.

He did after all direct Stand By Me which is probably the daddy of coming of age stories.As in the title, what I liked about this film was when it 'Flipped'. We'd first get Bryce's take on something that happens after which the same series of events would be told by Juli. It's a simple story - girl likes boy, boy doesn't like girl and only realises he does just after the girl begins to not like him. It's nothing new or original but it told with a simplistic charm and works wonders thanks to the two leads and outstanding supporting cast.This is a nice film. One of the type that will put you in a good mood and make you long (if you don't already have it) for a true love story of your own. My only complaint is the running time which seems way too short. There's so much build up to the inevitable between Bryce and Juli that when it comes, that's it - end of film.I'd like to think that a sequel could be made to continue the story but it probably won't happen.","

"FLIPPED","jackwriter-82633","17 February 2023","Flipped is filmed in Southwest Michigan and takes place in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Two grade schoolers, sweet Juli and the two-faced jerk Bryce, live across the street from each other, go to the same school and are in the same classes. They ride bikes, climb trees and as a throw-back to the previous generation Juli has chickens and sells the fresh eggs to her neighbors do for 60 cents a dozen.Well, as one who also grew up in Southeastern Michigan in the 1960s, I can relate to just about every aspect of this fine tale. The fact that it is directed by one of my contemporary sociopolitical heroes, Rob Reiner, makes my appreciation for Flipped all the more satisfying. Watch this movie. If you have a heartbeat, you'll enjoy it.","

"FLIPPED","javierbaron2008","12 December 2023","It took thirteen years for me to come across this beautiful film that tells how first love is built.It is the story of Juli and Bryce; since they become neighbors and schoolmates in elementary school, their transition to teenagers and the consolidation of their love in high school.A premise that has been told any number of times. It is the mastery with which the narrative is developed that makes it unique and endearing.All events are told from both perspectives. It is very fun to see how a situation can be perceived in such different ways.As in any worthwhile romance, this one simmers for several years while we get to know their respective families.Rob Reiner's hand is noticeable. Creator of the memorable: When Harry Met Sally. He has the ability to capture a relationship with ups and downs over several years without resorting to clichés or corniness. He shows how after physical attraction it is the personalities that end up falling in love beyond the person's appearance.","

Went blindly for it putting my complete faith on my sister's recommendation which mostly would be great. And then it was altogether a heavenly feel. Was a bliss, every dialogue and the importance of each character and the emotional touch that binds everything together has been done brilliantly. It never happens but I loved the movie so much that I saw it twice back to back without a break. Most movies have a fixed plot but the drama is a genre where the director can explore things way beyond the story and give serious importance to granular emotions. This kid love story is no way lesser than the masterpiece trilogy ""Before Sunrise...."". This is one of the best feel-good movies that anyone would love irrespective of age and taste. It sometimes feels like the IMDb that once was alive before 6 years is completely messed up now. There is no correct way to differentiate good movies from the bad ones when the superhero movies usually get 7 and above rating. This one should definitely be an 8 pointer and above, also surely deserves a strong place in TOP 250 when ""Inside Out"" can be in.","

The way the emotions of both sides of coin ( the boy and the girl) have been portrayed is very connecting. At all point of time while watching the movie one can actually put herself/himself in the shoes of the characters. Family ties, childhood notions, societal upbringing and school for teenagers have actually been brought to life.A must watch for audience appreciating deep emotions reflected via a common man's life. Its a dive into everyone's childhood dreams. A reflection of how children learn, grow and love truly. Callan and Madeline have given a clean soul to the characters visualized by Rob Reiner.

The trailer reminded me a little of when I was a kid and first watched the film Stand By Me which is still one of my all time favourites, maybe it was just the music. I decided to watch Flipped because I've seen every other film thats been released over the past few years and felt I'd ran out of options of decent films to watch so thought what the hell it can't hurt to give this a try. As I began to watch the film I was drawn into the magic of the story like I was a part of it. I could imagine myself at that age and lots of happy memories began to flow back and perhaps some regrets too, things I wished I'd done at a younger age but was now too late. I loved how the film flipped from each perspective giving me an insight into one another's thoughts. I quickly realised that this film was one of the best feel good films I'd seen in along time, one which I'll enjoy talking about and recommending to my friends for a while and surely a film I'll never forget. I can't describe it other than the film has a magic feel to it that one doesn't see in films anymore. The director and everyone who took part in making this did an excellent job and the acting was superb. I hate to admit but I enjoyed the film so much my eyes began to water a little, sad I know but inside I feel happy enough to write this review to spread the word of how truly magnificent the film really is. Watch with your partner or alone, either way you'll be happy you didn't give this film a miss... Enjoy!Long live the sycamore tree! :)","

She has strong opinions and is a good person, but the kind of person you just don't want to cross. She has no grey and is merciless about truth and justice. Our boy hero is a normal boy, eager to have a comfortable life and will go with what was the easiest way to live, lie or adjust, or be quiet in the face of injustice - in short, he is like all of us. The other characters are equally fun to be around - they have all been etched beautifully, with the quiet goodness of Juli's parents with their struggles, genteel poverty due to the choices they have made.

"FLIPPED","mdebono75","23 October 2012","What a wonderful journey into a child's world - or I should say children's' worlds. This movie makes one appreciate the innocence and spontaneity of children and how adults can either foster this creativity or block it. It is a deep movie which gives meaning to appreciating the simple things in life, and not take things for granted. It is also an example of how children can often be the real teachers rather than the other way round. It is an example of how being open to others' differences may lead to opening new doors and how bitter and lonely can some people become when they are set in their own ways. I thought the way the narration switched between the 2 child protagonists, was brilliant. We always want to hear both sides of a 'love' story, and this film gives you that. This is not just a story of love at first sight, but it is a chance to ponder on different characters who represent the persons' next door. Who ever seems strong may be weak, and who ever seems cuckoo may be the trend setter. ""To each his own"" - Who are we to judge?","

The presentation of the movie is so practical and the expression of love at a tender age has been brought about in such intricate detail, it can very well question the understanding of love we adults claim to have.Each scene has been given the right amount of time and attention in a relaxed pace without making the story look either stuck anywhere or rushed towards the end. Since it has been given a narrative structure, almost every major event in the story is shown from both Juli and Bryce's perspectives, giving the audience total freedom to decide which side they relate more to. Family conflicts, problems often faced by middle-class households, and social differences prevalent in the society have been very sensitively showcased.Some more scenes describing the kind of relationships Juli and Bryce had with their respective siblings could have made the story fuller.

Lets see: The movie isn't bad. It brings a lot of nostalgia of that bitter-sweet moment we all had as children: our first love. All the happy moments and all the emotional roller-coaster that came with it. My problem are the voice overs. The ENTIRE movie format is based on them. We're already seeing whats happening so we don't need the protagonists explaining it to us. Maybe some small bits would've worked. But not every single step. Not the full time. It gets tedious. If you can bypass that, then the movie isn't too bad.","

"FLIPPED","user1089r","24 December 2010","Reviewed from DVD.No interactive menu. Navigation problems: each time you start the movie, you must fast-forward through all six commercials, one at a time. No chapters; if you want to reach the spot where you left off, you must fast-forward to it. There are subtitles, but the English ones are thoroughly hidden: surprisingly, you must hover over ""Español"" to see ""English"". And this is a Rob Reiner film? This can turn out to be important (see below).Very lovely video quality. This is simply a very beautiful movie. The protagonist in particular -- also the narrator of the story -- played by Callan McAuliffe, does a fine job, especially for a fourteen-year-old. Unfortunately, this is not the case for his wannabe girlfriend, played by Madeline Carroll, a very unfortunate choice.Since the plot is for the most part pretty drab, it is up to the director and the actors to make up for it, but Ms. Carroll's performance in a prominent role is truly annoying, making the film almost unwatchable, which only adds to the problem. After half an hour, I actually turned on the subtitles and muted the sound, so that I could avoid listening to her voice. It must be said, however, that the teenage girl she played is more than a little aggressive, which only aggravated the problem with her speaking voice.I repeat, this is a visually very beautiful movie; I would even say stunning. If you feel you can somehow tolerate the annoyance of Ms. Carroll's interpretation of the protagonist's girlfriend and the unimaginative storyline, give it a try.","

"FLIPPED","Starlitelet","27 May 2011","I was in the mood for some romantic comedy film and luckily came across Flipped. I was sceptical at first, since the casts are not very known (even though they are young) and I did not see any promotions of movie. So I decided to watch the trailer. I caught a glimpse of Callan McAuliffe. He looked awfully familiar until I remembered seeing him in I Am Number Four. I Am Number Four was not a memorable movie, but I remember that Callan McAuliffe caught my attention more than Alex Pettyfer. Acting:I was curious to see how much Callan would be able to offer to Flipped. Needless to say, he stole my heart. A child actor (he was 15 at that time) was able to make me reminisce and feel nostalgic about my childhood crushes. He did not do much, but his simple emotions and gestures gave so much depth to his character, Bryce Loski. He was so pure and innocent, yet trouble minded. This guy can definitely act. He successfully wins the hearts of the audience. His performance is on the same level as Madeline Carroll, who is Juli Baker, his puppy love. They both go hand in hand because when they are alone, you feel their pain or happiness. However, when they are together, they shine even more. Juli plays the witty and adventurous girl with just the right amount of purity. I am amazed by their acting because their acting seemed so real and genuine.As for the other actors, they did not make the movie better. I was not astound by any of their performances because anyone could have played them, really. Their roles did seem realistic and allowed the storyline to flow smoothly. 9.5/10Storyline:The plot is extremely simple, yet beautiful. It seemed a little too simple for me when I saw the trailer. It is like the boy having this crush on his next door neighbour and they start blooming. Nevertheless, it was much more magical than this. Even though the plot still remained simple like how I originally thought of it, there was a huge pathos factor attached to it. I really believe it is hard to create these type of genres and make the audience feel attached to the characters. It takes a huge amount of work for the actors and director. I really liked how we saw from both of their perspectives. In other words, they played the same scene twice to show each other point of view. It definitely did not get redundant, and I thought it was the one of the film's strong points.There were some minor cons that I thought could have made the movie better. Like, they should have delved more into Uncle Daniel. That being said, there should be more development between the two families and why they are like that. There were moments where I asked a lot of why and how questions. One of them being why did Mr.Loski have apathy on the Baker's family. Entertainment:On a side note, Flipped reminds me of 5 centimetres per second. It is a beautiful anime movie. Not many people appreciate the movie because it is too simple and boring. However, I enjoyed that anime and perhaps that is why I enjoyed or loved Flipped. They carry a lot of emotions and depth on a different dimensions. In other words, not everything is explained in black and white. Emotions cry louder than words. These two literatures delve into the main character's development in life in such a realistic manner that most people can relate to. It has probably happened to us. This is no typical comedy movie, but it was way better than the sappy comedies I have seen recently. It made me smile and sad at the same time. I think this is appropriate or should be appreciated by any age group. It makes adults reminisce, whereas teenagers get a glimpse of what love is about. I hope to see more movies like this one!9.5/10","

This movie came out just last year, and it's now one of my favourite movies. For a movie to get into my 'Favourite movies list' it has to have great acting, a believable storyline, characters that make you feel a connection with them and most importantly, the ability to make me think. To have this movie make it onto that list alongside titles like The Shawshank Redemption, The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas and Little Miss Sunshine, well then, this movie is amazing.The two leads are about 15 and 16 this year, which is roughly my age. I'm going to tell you the truth, I really do not like the new face of Hollywood. The acting is blunt and the actors aren't being the characters. However, McAuliffe and Carroll have brought their respective characters' personalities out. They've put it out for all to see and sympathise with, taking the audience on a beautiful journey in their lives. I loved the two characters from the very beginning, and was intrigued by how practical and down to earth they were. What I loved was how the storyline unfolded. Both sides of this childhood romance was shown, both parties able to tell their side of the story. Typically, a romance is told in such a way that there's always one victim in the situation, and s/he cries until the other welcomes them back with open arms. Well boo hoo. In Flipped, both Bryce and Juli's sides were told from the first person point of view, which allows the readers to feel for the two characters as though they were part of the romance. The technique used was such a personal one, one which connected the audience with the movie. The audience was allowed a trek inside both their minds, all the while just thinking 'Oh, just get together already!' It made me want to reach into the screen and yell 'Now, elope.'Flipped will forever be on my 'Watch Forever list'. A timeless, innocent romance of two young loves which will be enjoyed by all. A definite 9/10.","

Until l watched it myself,l was deeply moved by this story. The altitude between July and Bryce lead the whole story,and what made me moved was the sincere love between two children that has no profits. This type of love is what l wanted. Beside that,the characters' skill of acting in this movie are also perfect. And in the ending,there is more room for imagination for moviegoers,like whether the first kiss between July and Bryce will happen or not.","

Bryce is cute but this movie has no other redeeming features.Stilted dialogue and stiff performances by all except grandpa. No emotional connection. However, we did love seeing a snake eat a whole egg, crack it in his belly and spit out the shell. Not gross at all but not at all convincing that this snake was actually a pet at home.We like the chickens and the ending because a tree was planted and it was a real sycamore tree. I hope they left it there after the movie.Not worth the $3.99 we spent to rent it.","

It explains the little girl fall in love for the little boy at first sight and to express her love throughout adolescence. What makes me the most impressive is the dreamy scene, the total picture makes me feel very happy and relaxed. The story proceeds in chronological order, with a compact plot that does not drag, and the cohesion is very appropriate. The director uses a dual protagonist perspective to shoot, which can help the audience better understand the theme. The only drawback is that the ending of the story was a bit sudden and ended unexpectedly.","

"FLIPPED","w-15336","3 April 2023","It's a story about growing up,family,self knowledge and the perception of others. All action begins with love,Juli fell in love with Bryce at first sight, so she has a long infatuation and preference for him;Juli's father loves his family and life, so he would rather be down and out than give up his brother, so he loves to describe life with paintings;Juli's two brothers love music, so they pursue their dreams fearlessly. Bryce's father also loves music, so he hates himself for giving up music. This is one of the most important themes:love
Meanwhile,I have seen a lot of different attitudes towards life and the choices people make as they grow up. What impressed me most was Julie's father's statement about whether the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and Bryce's final growth.Julie's father's words let us realize that the cognition of people should not be attracted by the surface of the bright, the inner fullness is the most important.The growth of Bryce is what touched me most. After a series of events, Bryce learned to think by himself and express his ideas bravely, instead of being led by people around him. This is the growth and transformation of a teenager, which deeply touched me.","

The main characters Bryce and Juli are really cute. I was left wondering my days back in elementary school, the teenage love, mood swings, unpredictable behavior and the never ending saga of changes. Although there are some parts that I suppose can add more substance like the character of professor Simon. After watching the movie I was left quietly sitting in our living room area and just stare blankly and I was smiling (sounds crazy but it's true). These are low budget movies with every bit of penny worth it. I give it 10 out of 10 stars as I was deeply happy on the outcome of the film.","

There was no doubt about it that she fell for his beautiful dazzling eyes. But for Bryce she was just a staler. It took 4 years for Bryce to actually understand and accept his love for her. She waited and waited, went through everything alone.. But for Bryce she was someone he wanted to get away from. But realization dawned on him when he hurt her pretty badly. And after getting hurt repeatedly she became distant, maybe got over him. But, he fell oh so deeply in love with her. At last they got together when Bryce planted the sycamore tree for her, one that got cut down, one she loved so fondly. Love comes to us in completely unexpected ways. Not every time we are ready to give in. But true love waits. It flips your heart and you fall oh so deeply in it unknowingly.
This story will take you on a roller coaster of emotions. It'll make you soft to the core. And will make you believe that in any corner of the world there's still the purest form of love.","

What makes it more charming is that it is based in the 1950s and the early 1960s, which adds a hint of class and drama to all the characters. There is a separate genre of coming of age movies, as how one finds him/herself under the various circumstances. But Flipped gives you more sense of things in not so obvious sense. It touches so many aspects of life and connects with you at so many level. The Story uses the teenagers as tools to give you an enlightenment on perspective, prejudice, character, Morality, Love and Life. The movie stays with you and will leave a smile every time you will hear the word ""Flipped"".","

I liked the switching of points of views between Bryce and Juli. This gave the movie an extra niche. The kids and their parents both played their role excellently well. Each character played its own part in building the character of the two kids. The role played by John Mahoney was important and critical for the story too. This movie can be very touching .

"FLIPPED","mdlcbfla","11 June 2011","The premise had such promise, and the structure (alternating perspectives) was a great way to tell the story. I have to blame it on the director. There's no way this many halfway decent (or better) actors could turn in such superficial performances. The family yelling scenes are pathetically bad, no nuance at all, suited for film-making 30+ years ago. Everything the Anthony Edwards character does is cringe-worthy and over the top. Look at the gestures the characters make. It's like nothing was suggested to tone down the melodrama. Only Madeline Carroll shows exceptional acting ability, and even that is not consistent. Also, listen to the diction in the dialog. This was supposed to take place in the early 60s, but the words and phrases used are colloquial from today. It ends up being a cross between an After School Special and something on Lifetime. It's not unwatchable, but only as a last resort.","

The way the film is structured and narrated from each protagonist makes it even more heartwarming. It is unexpectedly different, original even, in comparison to the regurgitated romantic comedy movies that have no depth. It is a movie for all ages as Flipped explores each family member and I assure you, you can definitely relate to one of them in someway and feel comfortable and warm watching this movie. I fell in love with the cast, each actor fitted in their roles perfectly.It has its funny moments, cute, heart-throbbing and sad moments; it's Truly Wonderful, Original and sweet.

"FLIPPED","tragedydq","30 November 2016","First of all, I love this movie so much and I would like to appreciate Rob because he reminds me of my first love via this movie. The movie is processing with two main characters – Juli and Bryce. Juli is a very beautiful girl: Long chestnut hair, big green eyes, like a melted ice cream in the summer. However, she is pretty naughty. She is ready for a relationship when she is 7 and she even hit the newspaper's headline because of hampering her neighbors cutting the tree. She is entangled his new neighbor which is a little handsome boy Bryce. Bryce doesn't like to stay with Juli and so does his father Steven. Steven thinks Juli seems to be too animated and he hates Juli's father too! Steven thinks Richard is a jerk because of his ugly painting and ugly courtyard. In short, Juli's family is a freak in the neighborhood. With the age growing up. Juli and Bryce's life are slowly and subtly changing. Their views of the each other and also the world are changing too. In this process, Bryce's grandfather Chet plays an important character. He is the first guy to helps Bryce finds Juli's unique and helps Juli in obscurity. Moreover, the most interesting thing of the story is that the director uses the linear narrative mode, it also has a sub-mode of repetition and contrast. In this way, I can clearly feel the difference, contradictions, gaps between the boys and girls. It just sent me back to when I was young and reminding how much I avoided girls and how many tricks that I put on them.My favorite part of the film is the experiences of the main character's growth. Most of the coming of age genre movies are event driven not personality driven, the psychological changes and behavioral choices are often driven by some sudden events. However, Flipped describes the processing of the growing and maturing in the daily life. Juli doesn't love thinking since she was young. She realizes the beauty's difference of the appearance and the inherent when she pursuits the true beauty. Bryce also becomes a warrior from a cowardly kid step by step. Rob leads us to flip from Juli's view to Bryce's view to shows us the true nature of their friendship and love, their love and respect to each other and ends this story with a lovely and sweet ending. All in all, I enjoyed this movie and would like to recommend it!","

Then again, I love and admire almost all of Rob Reiner's work. He achieves to imprint a soul to the story and their characters in his movies (rare to find in an American reel), blurring the gap I feel there is in the way of telling a story (regarding European approaches e.g.), and gets the best of both worlds with a true original. If I ever get into this business as I've been dreaming since my kid years', I would love to follow his example.My deepest thanks to his work, and very best wishes he keeps on making these worth watching films.","

(a mistake on my part, I hadn't paid attention on the DVD cover, and for a European family, the language and the accent of the French-Canadien dubbers is simply horrible, the translation of the original dialogue is too weird for us, scriptwriters write the texts in Canadian-French almost word for word. For exemple : ""for real"" in English become ""pour vrai"" in French-Canadian, but in French from France or Belgium, ""for real"" is translated by : ""pour de vrai ou vraiment !"". So, because of that, the film was, for us, not as so beautiful as it had to have been. It's a cute film, but I will have to see it a second time in the original language to make a real and good review.
And for my friends from French Canada counties, no worries, I love you, I love your accent, I love your expressions so naïve... Then ""Tabernacle"", try to do good translation from English (not a word to word) and you will be great in all over the world for the French people :)

As noted elsewhere, this is a refreshing departure from the standard special effects vehicles. It captures the mood and pace of the 1960s nicely. The alternate perspectives of the two main characters worked well, and the development of the characters is adroitly done. I actually did not recognize Penelope Ann Miller and Rebecca DeMornay until the end credits. This may be because I had not seen either actor in a movie for some years, but also probably equally due to their makeup and clothing. Their portrayal of 1960s housewives was very effective. Overall, visually, this movie does a great job of putting the viewer into the 1960s. Not sure how effective this would be for someone who did not experience the 1960s. Highly recommended.","

Reiner has made some of my favorite movies of all time and shown, perhaps, more diversity than any other director working today (could you get more different than This is Spinal Tap, Stand by Me, The Princess Bride, A Few Good Men, and When Harry Met Sally?). At his best, his films are a home run, and even his worst films were solid base hits, but I guess everyone has to strike out once in a while.As I watched this story unfold in a very straight forward, obvious and uninteresting way, I struck by the uniformly poor acting from everyone (with the possible exception of Mahoney). Then it dawned on me -- it's not the acting, it's the characters. Each was a simple stereotype and barely even 2 dimensional. The actors were doing exactly what was being asked of them and the only fault I can really find with them is their poor choice in choosing this project in the first place. And the worst part of it is that the story itself was not that bad. It was just poorly executed.I have not given up on Rob Reiner as filmmaker. He has given me hundreds of hours of enjoyment over the years. So I'm just going to try to put this clunker he phoned in out of my mind and will go back and watch The American President for the 20th time.","

"FLIPPED","dada1994","26 February 2011","As a big fan of the book, this movie was a major let down to me. I know movies can't include every detail of a book, but some scenes were changed in a way that removed all the emotion the book created. (When Chet told Bryce why his mother was crying and whenever he spoke to him it wasn't as if they never spoke.) When Bryce told him family about the chickens, instead of telling them he didn't actually ask Juli, he simply lied and let them think he did. The fact that the actual story doesn't take place in the late 1950s also makes it completely different. I disliked how Bryce only had lunch with one girl on the day of the auctions. I did not finish watching the movie, but as a person who enjoyed every word of the book, this movie was a major let down.Pros - Juli and Bryce narrating their sides of each story, good technologyCons - strayed away from book too much, Bryce's mom and sister looked too alike (I got them confused and I disliked his mother's hair), being set in a different time (I would understand '90s but '60s is too much).","

Does Flipped compare to other similar Reiner films, like Stand By Me? No. But what Flipped does, it does well. The acting is genuine, and manages to capture a semblance of the timeless facets of youth that seem unburdened by time. Although the film can err on playing out like something out of a 50's TV series, Reiner manages to blend the cutesy kitsch with touching moments that keep this film from turning into a sugary mess. One could argue the film is slow and uneventful, and to a certain extant I agree. Despite this, Flipped manages to intrigue and make you feel all fuzzy inside. 8/10. Great movie!","

Now concerning the movie it's an amazing first- young love and being able to see both sides of their story was and is amazing. I loved that they went above and beyond to follow script of the book but the slight changes aren't kicking you in the face. They change some plots like the basket boys Scene for Bryce and no champ. As well as slight character look differences and conversations can be changed. But a change I liked (spoiler) was the ending of Juli going outside to sit with Bryce and help with planting, it kind of completed it in a way of not feeling as left out on what happens next. So I DO recommend this movie, as I rewatch it a lot and it never gets old!","

But it isnt just the romance, this film also focuses on whats like growing up as a child, what its like when you have arrogant parents or eccentric ones, how to accept and embrace your uniqueness and to never judge a person on their outwards appearance.It will definitely make you a blush with its adorableness but make you feel good with how smooth it is potrayed.","

It's 2023, this is so worth it and I'm glad I watched it even if I'm 13 years late. The storyline is very simple and predictable, with synopsis alone, anyone could already tell where the story. Plot tells a story of teenagers as they discover what's there in life and love. The setting might took place at 1960s but the relativeness of the scenes to any generation doesn't differ that much as we all grow and learn regardless of the age. Most people could relate to atleast one character in the story and maybe atleast once in their life experienced having a crush on someone or being liked by someone. Watching the two perspective is like seeing two sides of the coin and as the story progressed we saw it flipped.","

"FLIPPED","gbrlzander","23 April 2022","The movie flipped is a romantic comedy-drama film about two teenagers, Bryce Loski and Juli Baker played by Callan McAuliffe and Madeline Carroll. Although the actors did a pretty good job the plot was slow and boring.The decor seems a bit like the early 70s or the late 60s but in reality the movie takes place in 1953. I also feel like the way that the people in the movie where talking to modern compared to when the movie takes place, I can excuse this since the movie is made for kids or young teenagers so it would be kind of hard for them to understand if the people spoke in old english. If you are a kid that doesn't really care about details and likes romance then you could maybe like the movie.There was a scene I really didn't like when Juli and her father visit her mentally disabled uncle. The acting of the uncle was excessive and showcased a small minority of how mentally disabled people act, this could make children watching the movie belive that all mentally disabled act this way. The uncle was also in a special place for mentally disabled people which is realistic for the time at which the movie takes place, but I feel like adults should explain too children that most mentally disabled people don't live in those kinds of places anymore.I think that the movie lacks originality with the girl meets boy plot that has been repeated over a hundred times.I got really annoyed by the poor and unrealistic choices of the teenagers during the movie.Overall I am really unimpressed by the movie and I would not recommend for anyone who doesn't like slow movies. The only thing I was impressed with was the actors.","

""flipped"" is a very simple story, but it is very rich. The main story is about children's puppy love. In fact, this movie also tells about pursuing their dreams, respecting, industrious, how to treat poverty, how to accept disabled families, and how to maintain their self-esteem.One detail that impressed me deeply is that after the parents quarreled, they immediately said to the child, ""We will solve it, it's not your fault."" Then they took turns comforting her, indicating that the parents still love each other and reassuring the child. That's why children feel, ""I don't think it's easy for Mom, and I don't think it's easy for Dad, either. But born in this family, I'm lucky."" Loving parents are better than wealthy parents.Continue with ""flipped"". I envy this kind of heroine in American culture, just like the old lady in ""UP"": she has an adventurous spirit, a romantic spirit, a courage to be different, a sense of wisdom and responsibility, a down-to-earth ability to achieve her dreams, a vibrant, loving, loved, healthy body and soul. In our popular culture, the female protagonists are mostly foolish and naive, confused, optimistic, and emotionally rich, waiting for the male protagonist to take pity on them.In a nutshell, the heroine in the United States is a tree, a flowering tree that grows well without a hero;
Our heroine is a flower, a crippled flower, some with tragic experiences and bodies, waiting for a man to save them. Bad love is when you lose the whole world for one person
Good love is when you see the whole world through one personI always want to strive to enrich myself and make myself better than before. I want to be a person with a gorgeous heart in my grandfather's mouth. So that I can meet you with a strong and beautiful
Beautiful Shirley only talks about tents and food. And Julie, who is not very attractive, can join the conversation of ""perpetual motion machine"" at will .This is not to say that face is not important to girls .The same sentence should be used to attract others with the appearance of beauty to discover your inner beautyRather than seeing your emptiness and ignorance as people get closer to you.A girl like Julie is really cute with a kind heart that understands beauty and life. Climb a tall tree and watch the sunrise and sunset. Think about the whole that is larger than the part. She said to Bryce that there's no room for beautiful things in your eyes. I sympathize with you. The infinite beauty of the setting sun seen on the wutong tree
The little wisdom and subtle details embodied throughout the film also add color to itWho would have thought that a boy's secular, rude, and mean father had a musical dream when he was a teenager
Life is like a ruthless knife that has changed our appearanceGrandfather exists as a bridge to guide boys to communicateI like his white hair and sideburns, showing a wise and uncommon temperament
What an extraordinary woman is that grandmother who is always mentioned by him
A kind girl mother who supports a poor family with loveAlways have a warm expectation for a better lifeThe alternation of psychological activities between boys and girls is also ingeniousThe pounding heart is enough to tell this sweet story of adolescence.","

From another point of view, Bryce's family atmosphere is not good, his father looks down on Julie's family and even everything about Julie. A father's influence on his children is huge, I think in this kind of education, Bryce is not a good match for Julie. The logic of this movie is not sound. I think the reason that Julie falls in love with Bryce is too far-fetched. A pair of sparkling eyes is not worthy of her love again and again.","

The movie is unfolded through rhe two characters,making people surprised.In the meantime,I really like how the story shows. The overall painting style of the film is very fresh and beautiful,and it is easy to immerse people in it. Bryce gradually approached and fell in love with Julie from the beginning through resistance. This process is also a signal of his own inner transformation.Although the plot of the movie is a bit old-fashioned, it still tells the people a lot of truth. For example, it is necessary to look at a person with heart, communicate promptly when encountering difficulties, and not discriminate against vulnerable groups.","

Switching back and forth clearly shows the changes in the two people's different psychological feelings, but also more vividly and profoundly sees the growth process of boys and girls. The heart movements or misunderstandings of adolescence are precious and beautiful memories. It tells the story of an ordinary girl who fell in love with a middle-class boy from the next door neighbor when she was young. The boy initially disliked the girl and later the girl didn't like the boy, and then the boy fell in love with the girl in turn. I like the changes in a girl's mind. I once thought that the person I liked was my own piece of sky. As I became more and more outstanding and had a larger world view, I suddenly realized that the beauty I once thought was just that.",NA
"FLIPPED","x-39208","28 March 2023","""Flipped"" is a romance-themed film. Drive the plot by describing the love story between Juli and Bryce. Juli passed from love to hate to love. The plot is turbulent and fascinating. Finally,Bryce planted a sycamore tree successfully gained July's heart. Turly,this is one of those rare gems you stumble upon only in a blue moon. Give it a try! You won't regret it! The movie is shown from the POV'S of both main characters,and often the same event will be shown from each of their perspectives. It works really well,as it really helps the viewer to ""get"" both Bryce and Juli. It's a wonderfully told coming-of-age story,which i could relate to in many ways.",NA

She is independent and hardworking, self-respecting but not sensitive enough to have thorns all over her body. As Bonnie said in another article, she would grow well without that boy. For initiation films, it is of great educational significance to children and parents, and it has very positive and valuable values regardless of setbacks or love.I don't like you when you like me; When you fall in love with me, I like you; I fell in love with you when you left me; Are you walking too fast, or I can't keep up with your footsteps ........",NA
"FLIPPED","i-67084-91155","28 March 2023","The first moment Julie locked eyes with Bryce, she couldn't stop thinking about the first kiss that could have happened between them, the first kiss that this wonderful boy treasured. Everything went on in this inexplicable way -- Julie was constantly expressing her affection for Bryce and pursuing him. Bryce hated Julie, but had to be a gentleman while doing everything he could to keep her away. After all, in the eyes of his family and his family, the person named Julie not only looks ordinary, but also does not have the right ""lawn"" for him. Everything has come to a ridiculous pace.Julie's father, a painter, told her that looking at a person is like looking at a painting, you can't just look at some simple part of it, and a painting is more than the sum of its parts.Look at the whole picture. It's dangerous to look at the parts, to look at the whole, to seek the beauty of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. Julie didn't quite understand what her father had said. She just enjoyed climbing up to a sycamore tree in the school bus waiting area for a view. Up there, you get a different view.Until one day, she had to climb up high in the plane tree to pick up the kite, that day, she was fascinated by the scenery. Julie began to think about what her father had said, and she began to notice people she met at school. She found that the sum of the parts was always greater than the whole in almost all people, except for Bryce. She could not read him, she thought. Julie finally realized that Bryce was a coward at heart, with gorgeous looks, bright eyes, and a charming smile. She knew that all along it was just her not wanting to ""see"" -- that the whole of Bryce was less than the sum of its parts. She was relieved. And Bryce, who was left out in the cold
Under Grandpa's influence, I realized Julie's kindness more and more. He could not understand how he could not want to be close to such a girl. He summoned up his courage to get rid of his cowardice, no longer for the flashy rules of etiquette and against the heart, even in the case of friends threatened to break up with him, Bryce still boldly went to Julie's front, to show his heart. After Bryce planted a new sycamore tree for her, he touched Julie, who had been ignoring him, and they reconciled.""She adds to the beauty of the world you see through her own presence, and her experiences enhance your experience of the beauty of the world you see through your own.""",NA

The portrayal of your average boys and girls, families and neighborhoods.. human achievements and despair. BRILLIANT... brilliant. A movie covered in gold dust. I think you get the picture...I am lost for words. In an era of shallow special effects and even shallower portrayals of love and life... this movie is a diamond. Please watch it and let innocence woo you.I don't know if the actors and producers of the movie read these reviews but if you sometime do... thank you for the ""honesty""",NA

"FLIPPED","d-86994","28 March 2023","Julie's love for Bryce begins with his beautiful blue eyes. The change in his attitude comes from doubts about his character. We all find a pair of beautiful eyes and like beautiful and exquisite things, but for a person's love at first sight may come from natural attraction, just like Julie and Blake, Julie is seeing him. She determined the future at a glance. She was tireless. She ignored Blake's disbelief, because she was sure that she liked it and wanted to melt Blake's ""shyness"" with her enthusiasm. But for Black, Julie's harassment made him bored and even annoying, but there was a kind of ""Julie"" He may or may not like her, but he doesn't know either. Until later, Julie found that Blake had lost the eggs she gave her. She felt ridiculous. She questioned Blake and his love. She found that her love for Black came from a shallow appearance and did not know the real him. Blake regretted it after being questioned by Julie. He wanted to explain and apologize, but by this time Julie had put him down, but he found that he had fallen in love with Julie.I think this is the feeling of youth, pulling back and forth. There are rich emotions in the heart but they are hidden. It shows that nothing happens outside. That is the unique self-esteem and expression of young people!I highly recommend watching this movie. This is what youth looks like. It is beautiful and happy. Although there are small waves, it does not affect the final ending.",NA
"FLIPPED","l-88460","28 March 2023","It's a wonderful story. I totally fell in love with it. The love between Julianna and Bryce is so sweet and comedic. What I like most about this movie is the picturesque countryside it depicts. In the country there was little Julie and her most beautiful sycamore tree. Juli sat on her plane tree, felt the gentle wind on her face, enjoyed the majestic sunset, and was moved by the idyllic and quaint scenes that dyed the whole sky red. The scenes described in the movie are exactly the kind of country life I have been longing for. Expect more and better movies. I hope every time I see a movie, I can have the ultimate feeling and wonderful experience, just like I saw this movie. I like to see each movie as a unique experience.",NA

I really can't resist to smile every time Juli and Bryce have their talks.The movie was really great. Recommended for all ages.. Why all ages? Well you must all admit that you too experienced we had our first love way back years ago. How i wish life is still as light as before. Can you imagine the story happening on present year? Cellphones, emails, Facebook.. Surely the excitement factor will not be as great as compared to 60's 70's 80's or even early 90's...I'm rating this 9.9 out of 10...

Although the audience of this film is not wide, it is worth many of us to watch slowly, because it tells the love that many people look forward to. The cast of characters in this film is very good, and the acting is very surprising. This movie grew step by step and refreshed. Great piece of work by the actors, good cinematography and over all, beyond expected story. It may not be the best movie, but it must be one we must see in the course of our lives. I guarantee you will love this movie. You will watch it more than once.",NA
"FLIPPED","iralarry1","16 April 2012","I have been a fan or Rob Reiner since I was a kid watching All In The Family. There must be dozens of episodes I specifically recall Reiner in. This movie, Flipped, is exactly why I love the movies. A beautiful story told in a beautiful and emotionally memorable way. It was engrossing, well cast, excellently acted and marvelously directed. Reiner, as far as i am concerned hit it out of the park. A tender and anxious telling of early teen love from the perspective of both protagonists, young Julie and young Bryce. They live across from one another in suburbia and over time, redefine both their relationship and themselves in a scenario of self discovery and understanding.",NA
