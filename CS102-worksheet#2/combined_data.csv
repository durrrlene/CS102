                ""All I ever wanted was for Juli Baker to leave me alone.""Flipped is easily the best love story/relationship movie I've seen since (500) Days of Summer. I'm the kind of guy that you couldn't pay to watch a Nicholas Sparks movie, but that doesn't mean that I can't appreciate a good movie about the highs and lows of love. In a year of formulaic, mind-numbing flicks with no imagination or heart like Letters to Juliet, Flipped is a welcome breath of fresh air. It's about 8 or so years in the lives of two kids who meet when when one of them moves into a new neighborhood. Juli (played by Morgan Lily and Madeline Carroll) is instantly smitten by Bryce (Ryan Ketzner and Callan McAuliffe) the second she sees him drive up to his new house. Bryce, being a typical second grade boy, finds her attention embarrassing and unwanted. As they get older, that dynamic between them remains pretty much the same, but we wouldn't have a very interesting movie if that's all there was to it. Eventually Bryce finds himself on the other side of the equation (flipped, get it?), and has to win back the girl he never knew he always wanted.How odd is it that a movie about a couple of kids handles the topic of love in a more mature and genuine way than almost all of the adult-oriented romantic comedies that we're buried under each year? There's no doubt about it that Flipped will make you say ""aww"" on occasion, but there's a lot more to it than just kids being cute. Humor, issues of class, family conflict, and the lost idealism of youth are introduced into the story by Bryce and Juli's respective families, and there are several outright bittersweet or poignant scenes within the story.The movie is shown from the POV's of both main characters, and often the same event will be shown from each of their perspectives. It works really well, as it really helps the viewer to ""get"" both Bryce and Juli. The kids chosen to play the older versions of the two (Carroll and McAuliffe) are both great, the fact that the story is set in 50's or 60's suburbia adds a believable sense of innocence to it all, and there is just a fresh feeling to the movie that I can't really describe with words.I heartily recommend this to anyone who likes a good, well-written movie, regardless of the genre. You can tell that a lot of heart went into making Flipped, and it shows. Great movie.

                'Flipped' is truly a ""real movie"". Probably what most people enjoyed about this movie was that the events that happened in the movie could might as well have been their reality. Many people in this world (if not all) have experienced having a real crush. This movie shows a crush blossoming from both a guy's and a girl's view. It was very interesting to see two viewpoints on this everyday happening. That is what makes this movie so appealing. Viewers get to watch Bryce and Juli's emotions whenever they see the other. Viewers see Bryce and Juli's smiles that they can't help. Viewers get to know who exactly Bryce and Juli are.Anyone and everyone will enjoy this movie or can at least, relate to it. Even adults! This film will surely take you down memory lane and help you remember the feelings you had when you were first in love. I've never experienced being in love before, but this film makes it seem wonderful. I absolutely loved this film.Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe were great in this film! Even if they're very young, they did wonderful jobs in performing here. In each of their scenes, you could sense the emotions that they were feeling and wanted to convey to the viewers. The characters themselves were also very interesting. Particularly Ms. Juli Baker. It was nice to see such a free-spirited teenager, who was very opinionated and didn't let anything stand in her way. The chemistry that both actors had were average. I thought that they showed their most potential when acting by themselves, in their own surroundings.I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that Rob Reiner, the director of this film, was the same person who directed 'When Harry Met Sally' and 'Sleepless in Seattle'. So far, all romantic-comedies that Rob Reiner has directed has not disappointed me. I can't wait for more of his works! All his rom-coms are excellent additions to the romance movie genre.This was an amazing teenage romantic comedy. Surely one of my favorites, right up there with 'When Harry Met Sally'. Do not miss this film. It's baffling to see that this film isn't as popular as it's supposed to be.Viewed on: April 5, 2011 ; December 16, 2011

                Juli just had to take one look at Bryce's blue eyes, and she knew it was true love. Bryce just had to take one notice of Juli's manic desperation, and he knew it was going to be a friendship of torment. I just had to take one look at the film's artfully designed poster, and I knew ""Flipped"" was a film to be savoured.A beautifully told film of first love, we flip from Juli's point of view to Bryce's point of view, very effectively giving us the true nature of their friendship, love and respect they have for each other. Except in the case of middle-school graders, that love and respect can frequently look like embarrassment, mistrust, and shame. All of those emotions are told with intelligence, subtlety and humour.""Flipped"" has all of the comedy, naiveté and bewilderment of first love. It takes the romantic comedy farther by actually giving us characters with real depth. There is more going on than just Juli and Bryce figuring out their love for each other, and every aspect of this film is well written, touching and relevant.""Flipped"" is a cute film for everybody who fondly remembers that fiercely independent girl or the guy with piercing blue eyes that lived across the street.

","
                ""Flipped"" is superbly directed by Rob Reiner and in my book, one of his best movies. It's a wonderfully told coming-of-age story, which I could relate to in many ways. The main two characters, Juli and Bryce, are very likable. Their parents, played by Penelope Ann Miller and Aidan Quinn, Rebecca de Mornay and Anthony Edwards, respectively, are believable in their roles, which they play excellently. I liked the fact that the story is told from two points of views, Bryce first and then Juli. If you want to see a really feel-good movie, instead of watching some dumb comedy or shoot 'em up flick, go see FLIPPED! You will not regret it.

                I just discovered this gem on Netflix and was impressed, moved and entertained. Its a romantic film about puppy love, so it may not be for everyone (even teens) but I found the leads to be charming and charismatic. The plot device is nothing new, but the charm and early 60's setting make it fresh in many ways. A wonderful cast led by the young leads (now grown!), the late John Mahoney and Aidan Quinn help make this film watchable and enjoyable. A wholesome movie with wonderful moments.

                The first few minutes sent me back a decade reminding how much we avoided girls or getting our names attached to one..I really liked how the story showed a basic fact (mostly at least) :""The one you love doesn't love you back, and you don't love the one that loves you!""Though the main story is not that all can relate to, the background or the base of the story was really nice. The character development was good, not like many movies which focus on only the main characters. Though the story was a little predictable, the movie is enjoyable and among a few to which we can relate to.This movie is definitely worth a watch.And it deserves an 8 out of 10.

","
                Back in 1973, an episode of ""All in the Family"" told the same story from three different perspectives, one of which was from the point of view of Mike ""Meathead"" Stivic, played by Rob Reiner. Watching his latest directorial effort, I wondered if the ""he said / she said"" gimmick of that episode (""Everybody Tells the Truth"") was what attracted Reiner to ""Flipped,"" the young-adult novel by Wendelin Van Draanen, which employs the same multi-POV technique that Lawrence Durrell perfected with his ""Alexandria Quartet"" in the late 1950s. The film version of ""Flipped"" shows Reiner at the top of his form, a worthy addition to an ouevre that includes such classics as ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" ""Misery,"" ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Stand By Me,"" the 1986 period piece that ""Flipped"" most recalls, with its younger characters and coming-of-age theme. At the heart of ""Flipped"" is Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll), a smart, pretty and thoughtful girl who you just can't help losing your heart to. Juli herself flips for Bryce Loski, who is at first repelled by Juli and then slowly starts to see her for the lovely person she is. The cast is augmented by such pros as John Mahoney (Frasier's dad on ""Cheers""), Anthony Edwards, Aidan Quinn and Rebecca De Mornay and Penelope Ann Miller. The film offers up various slices of life from the late '50s and early '60s that makes for a nostalgic, romantic and very moving film. Special kudos to the filmmakers for finding a girl to play young Juli (Morgan Lily) who looks chillingly like Madeline Carroll; I would have bet anything the two were sisters. For those who are bored by the dumb-dumb summer comedies of 2010 (""The Other Guys,"" ""Dinner for Schmucks"") and the special-effects hijinks of ""Inception,"" this is a tender and emotionally satisfying journey that will stay with you for years.

                I really, really liked this film and now wonder why it didn't make more impact when it debuted. Perhaps it was just one of those films that slipped between the cracks because ""Flipped"" is a wonderful coming of age film--and is among director Rob Reiner's best.The film is set mostly in the early 1960s. A young boy, Bryce, moves to a new neighborhood and almost instantly the girl across the street, Juli, begins mooning over him and acting like she's infatuated with him. But he's 7--and hating girls and mushy stuff is normal and he resists her charms. But she persists as the years pass--and she's convinced herself that Bryce is her dream boy. But, as the years pass, Bryce is just as convinced that Juli is a pest. However, eventually, Bryce's attitude starts to change...too bad Juli's is as well!This is a remarkable film in so many ways. The direction is wonderful--perfectly paced and very sweet. The writing is also exceptionally sweet and enchanting. It also helped that there were some wonderful supporting actors to assist in telling the story-- some characters you really liked and cared about and a couple who were complete jerks. John Mahoney was particularly good, but the entire cast was wonderful in this movie. Overall, the elements all work together to tell a sweet story that anyone could love. My only quibble, and it's a very minor one, is about the music. Too many older films are saturated with oldies music. While a bit is nice, with some it sounds more like a best of record album...and at times I would have preferred ""Flipped"" to have been a bit quieter. Not a major complaint by any means and I still give this film a well deserved 9.

                Okay, let's dispense immediately with the idea that this film is geared toward teenagers and all of their sap that they go through. I assure you ""mature adults"" out there that this film will delight you also, unless you are a completely hopelessly lost Scrooge. This film should make sense to all ages. Everyone should identify with it. I don't care what kind of a snob, low-life, big wig, or puritan you are, you should enjoy this film. It's never too sappy when it deals with matters of the heart, nor is it too blunt and insensitive.The film is told almost entirely in a voice over of one of the two main characters. It's told in a brilliant he-said she-said style where the same scene is often told twice from the two opposite points of view (Juli's and Bryce's). So we see the opening scene twice. The first time as explained by Bryce, and the second time explained by Juli. This sort of formula is used many a time in the unfolding battle of the sexes. Of course this doesn't happen in every scene—that would get boring. Director Reiner gives us the proper dosage of everything in this film. The proper amount of comedy, romance, and the proper amount of sadness. Never is it sappy or indulgent or even presumptuous. It's a perfect film for what it's worth. The screenplay is absolutely the work of a fine craftsman—or craftsmen Andrew Scheinman and director Reiner. I don't know how long it took to write or how much blood went into it, but this film is the result of excellent work in every department. The two child stars are perfect in their roles (although Bryce could have done better), but the strength of the cast are in supporting actors. The cast is full of great actors, particularly Anthony Edwards as Bryce's arrogant, critical, smart-Aleck father, and the ever-welcome Aidan Quinn as Juli's loving, down-to-earth, tree painting father.I wasn't completely convinced of the excellence of the film until a beautiful scene in which Mr. Baker (Quinn) and Juli go to visit Mr. Baker's mentally retarded brother Daniel, who is so happy with the world and everything in it. But this scene can't be expressed in words, you have to see it. For what it's worth, Flipped is somewhat of a deep film, full of parallels to the real world. All of the characters have the proper amount of development, even the big sycamore tree that Juli likes to sit in and watch the sunrise. Her exploits while up in that tree are so poetic and beautiful when matched up with the pictures on screen. It's a beautiful and insightful scene into the thoughts and feelings of people in general, not just a teenage girl.In this day when films are almost all big-budget action movies with loud explosions, Flipped has explosions of its own kind. It has explosions of heart and feeling and character, all at the appropriate times. I did not find any ax to grind here. Other than the characters, plot, and screenplay, it's also a technically beautiful film. The camera captures everything so clearly with the proper color timing and excellently framed shots. After the mid-way point of the film, being surrounded by excellence, one starts to look for any reason to criticize the film. I found none. Every nuance of the film is done so genteelly and honestly, who can have a problem with it? This film achieves what movies are meant to achieve. They are meant to reach into are minds and draw us in, to entertain and to move us with fright, emotion, tears, laughs, whatever may be the subject. They are meant to create a world around us, whether in space, in the Wild West, in the future, in Bible times, or in the case of Flipped in 1960s suburbia. This film does exactly what it is meant to do. To touch and make us laugh and to remember. That's what it does. It makes us remember what happened or is happening to us. No one can give this a bad review. I don't see how anyone can pick a fight with the film. But I'm blabbing about nothing.In short, Flipped is by far the best film I've seen this year. I do hope the Academy doesn't overlook this like they do so many other ""family"" films. It should at least get a few nominations, if not a win. We'll see what happens. It's only July.www.colewebbharter.com

                This is a coming of age film set initially and briefly in the late 1950s and mostly in the early 1960s. The boy, Bryce, is chased by his neighbor girl, Juli. And is he chased! Juli is immediately smitten or ""flipped"" by Bryce's eyes and the story unfolds.What is unusual about the story telling is that each major event is played back twice - once through the eyes and voice of Bryce and once through the eyes and voice of Juli. It's the same scene, but you wouldn't know that from their differing viewpoints.Juli is the adventurous and interesting one. Bryce just wants to fit in at their Junior High School. Juli slowly begins to unlike Bryce and Bryce slowly begins to appreciate Juli. Will they ever meet at the same emotional place at the same time? That is the drama and story.The art direction and era are right on. It is the Eisenhower and Kennedy years in look, and even in feel. The wives are subordinate to the husbands. The children are mostly respectful to their parents. And the teachers teach and the students learn. But, you can see the seeds being laid for the rebellious war babies of the late 1960s.Rob Reiner is a talented director for romances - ""When Harry Met Sally."" And he is a talented director for handling young actors - ""Stand By Me."" He combines these talents to help us understand the better part of the human condition; that is, love, respect, sacrifice, forgiveness, and honor. And we have fun and laugh along the way. This is like the TV program, ""Wonder Years"" - but heightened and deepened.-Bob, a Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award Jury Member

                Flipped is a one in a million film - I mean, REALLY one in a million. It's refreshing and lovely, dramatic and hilarious. It does what few films do in our time (or rather what they don't do): Flipped does not sacrifice its integrity for raunchy, gratuitous content. It's real. The emotions are real. The characters are real. And while it certainly isn't G-rated fluff (and do not be fooled - this is not a film for young children), the movie is definitely gentle and innocent in many ways. On the downside, without giving anything away, the ending of the film could have been better patched together, but overall the movie is a cinematic gem like no other. Go see Flipped!

                Beautifully told with all the ingredients for a good family movie. The story is told from two different views, the view from the boy and from the girl. A boy who is annoyed by all the attention he gets from the girl across the street. The girl from across the street who has a super crush on the boy tells her part of the story. The boy's father is a man filled with hatred who dispenses politically incorrect lines throughout the movie. The grandfather, the great John Mohoney, is the wise person who tells the boy to really see the girl for what she is, a very special girl. I don't want to give anything away of this jewel of a movie. I enjoyed this movie very much and totally recommend it.

                It's a FANTASTIC one! I have completely fallen in love with it. The puppy love between Julianna and Bryce is so sweet and comedic.What l enjoy Most about the movie is definitely the picturesque countryside it depicts.Yeah,Countryside,along with little Juli and her ""most beautiful"" sycamore tree.I'm always touched by the bucolic and quaint scene where Juli's sitting in her sycamore tree,feeling the gentle breeze blush her cheek and enjoying the majestic and spectacular sunset ,dying the whole sky red.How amazing!It's just the kind of country life l am always yearning for.
Also,I bought this impressive American novel last year,which is as great as the movie.

                A very enjoyable movie, effectively embracing the coming of age sensitivities which come to us all. Although it is clear there are many nuances of other characters which never get dealt with, it's meant to be that way. This is about the kids, the effect they have on one another, their ability and inability to express their feelings, and what can happen when we finally face our fears about the other sex and dare to take a step toward resolving them. The only issue I have is that the film simply has too many anachronisms -- songs not of the period and figures of speech clearly from the present and not the fifties and sixties, but hey, I'm too darn picky about that stuff. Reiner has done it again, offering us a film in the style and tone of Capra. He has crafted a film of sensitivity and grace, and taught us something about life that most of us lose upon becoming adults. Madeline Carroll is simply wonderful as the independent teen taking life head on, and is a true pleasure to watch. She absolutely carries this film.

                Of all the movies I've seen lately, Flipped was amongst the most refreshing. If it had been done by a different director and had different screenwriters, it might be a terrible cliché. Story of first love, known each other since kids, bla bla bla, we've all heard it before.But this movie, it was so pure and so realistic, which is what I love about it most. It wasn't over the top romantic, but it was enough to tug my heartstrings and made me go ""awwww"" instead of going ""ewwww"".The characters felt like real people, and the issues faced in the story felt so real and believable, it made me believe in the basic form of love once more, and that it still existed in real life (even though I know it's just in the movies, but still).Anyway, if you're looking for a story that is refreshing yet vintage, and wanting to have a lovey-dovey grin plastered on your face, then this is the movie to watch.

                Flipped is a sweet, charming, moving, lovely, well-acted coming-of-age romantic drama comedy film.While the plot offers nothing new in particular (as with mostly all rom- com films)...the 'girl meets boy' mixed with 'the not-your-typical girl next door' story, but the storytelling is slightly different. Adapted from the book with the same name by Wendelin Van Draanen, the film is presented in a rather unique 'he-said she-said' style, through the eyes and thoughts of the male lead, Bryce and then again through the eyes and thoughts of female lead, Juli, alternately presenting their views and perspectives on a shared set of events. Nearly every single event that happened in the film is told at least twice, although it seems repetitive, but surprisingly, it never feels boring or annoying. It's actually fascinating and insightful to be able to see into the thoughts and feelings of people in general. Things are not really what it seems and there's always more than meets the eye. As the film progresses, you are so emotionally invested in the characters that you actually begin to eagerly anticipate what the other side of the story might be, how the other person feels the way he/she does. The film also gives a feeling of nostalgia, even for those who never lived in the era (the story is set in 50's or 60's suburban area) or experienced the same events as the two leads. It feels authentic and relatable nonetheless. Juli might appear as an ordinary girl, but she's a sweet, kind, beautiful, daring girl at heart once you get to know her.The two lead stars are perfect in their respective roles. Most of the characters in the film have sufficient character development for the audience to understand them. Flipped is a period young love story, told in a simple and heartfelt manner. A rare cinematic gem.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/shorter-movie-review-flipped.html Rating: 8/10""A painting is more than the sum of its parts. A cow by itself is just a cow.

","
                Flipped is a coming of age film directed by the coming of age master director Rob Reiner. Reiner directed the tear-jerker Stand By Me and is now back to bring Wendelin Van Draanen's novel of the same name to life. What a treat! Flipped and Stand By Me both make me wish my childhood was full of more adventure and fun rather than just me sitting on the computer writing review after review aspiring to be a critic. I get tears in my eyes to both films because I become so attached to the characters and they're living the life I can only dream to have. With the exception of unfaithful parents when it comes to Stand By Me.What came to mind halfway through the film was why couldn't the movie Speak have been this good? This film proves more than 80% can be done by narration from TWO characters different perspective and it can be done well. Why not do the same for Speak? Most of the dialog in this film is internal and not directly word of mouth and it works. Why not treat Speak the same way? Were they afraid they would mess it up? It begs an explanation to why Laurie Halse Anderson's novel's potential on film was unfaithful to it's film companion.Never reading the book, I do know that it was set in the nineties and the two thousands while this film's setting is in the late fifties and early sixties. It's not that big of a deal with the drastic setting change, but maybe I would've been more upset if I was a huge fan of the book to find out the film was set four years in the past.The movie about Bryce Loski (McAuliffe), a kid who moves into the neighborhood at a young age to immediately become eye candy to his new neighbor Juli Baker (Carroll). Bryce is resistant, while Juli is persistent. She is positive Bryce will give her her first kiss and believes Bryce is just a little shy, when really he wants nothing to do with her. Juli continues up until present day middle school to give Bryce the chance to admit his ""feelings"" for her but doesn't.Juli lives across the street from Bryce and her yard is an eyesore. It's paid for by the landlord since most of the money Juli and her family makes is given to Juli's father's mentally challenged brother. Bryce's family, his dad mostly, is annoyed by Juli and her family's crappy yard and continue to bad mouth and make assumptions about the Baker family when they really have no idea what it's like over there.The film is narrated by both leads more often than not. Usually we'll get five minutes or so of Bryce narrating his side of the story, while Juli narrates her's. It's almost an anthology because we see what goes on from Bryce's standpoint while hearing his thoughts at the moment and then we see what happened prior or after the events of Bryce's because we then go to Juli. It's confusing. But it works all the time.At the beginning of the film I thought the narrations were only used for the audience to get affiliated with the lives of the characters and what happened before we got here. We spend ninety minutes or longer with movie characters and some films don't even give you the damn courtesy to provide us with any kind of background information. We are supposed to just be thrown into a film with characters we sometimes don't even find out the last names to.The one minor problem I have with the film is the end. It leaves off on the wrong note. The film is only ninety minutes when it could and should be longer. The place they ended was fine, but the scenes on the DVD cover and poster never occur in the film. What a letdown.Flipped is 2010's underrated masterpiece and it definitely showcases a worthy coming of age film. It's smooth style of directing, great music, calm feeling even at it's most stressful, and strong leads are more than I could've asked for. Rob Reiner is something else. A true talent in the movie business. Especially when making a movie as heartfelt as this one.Starring: Callan McAuliffe, Madeline Carroll, Rebecca De Mornay, Anthony Edwards, John Mahoney, Penelope Ann Miller, Aidan Quinn, and Kevin Weisman. Directed by: Rob Reiner.

                With a technique borrowed from Casino of the story being told from two different protagonist points of view, Rob Reiner gives us a wonderful family film about first love. Flipped is a lot less bloody and a great deal sweeter than Martin Scorsese's gangster classic.The prosperous Loski family moves into the neighborhood where the ne'er do well Bakers live. On that day in the late fifties the kids that grow up to be Callan McAuliffe and Madeline Carroll set eyes on each other. Carroll thinks McAuliffe is the one, but such decisions at the age of 7 are sometimes reconsidered. And McAuliffe can't see her for beans, she's just an annoying girl which is not atypical for the second grade.Moving into junior high school is a different matter. With the onset of puberty both these kids are experiencing conflicting emotions. McAuliffe acts like a jerk sometimes, Carroll expects a bit much.The families are different. Anthony Edwards who is McAuliffe's dad is a bit of a fathead and has a thing about his neighbor's lifestyle. Their yard contains a chicken coop and is not in good shape and it's bringing down the values of the other property on the block. As for Aidan Quinn who is Carroll's dad and his family lives as it does in order to support his brother who lives in a sanitarium, an expensive private one for the mentally retarded. Quinn is a wonderful dad, but the Bakers live a whole lot like the Micawbers waiting for something to turn up.The women are wiser than the men, Rebecca DeMornay and Penelope Ann Miller the wives of Edwards and Quinn respectively bond. McAuliffe also has the wisdom of his maternal grandfather John Mahoney to lean on. He's a surrogate grandfather to Carroll as well.Rob Reiner came up with a real winner. The kids act like real kids as opposed to Hollywood kids. The grownups are neither all wise Deities or complete idiots. The women young and old do come out better than the men. I think everyone is going to like this one.Flipped is highly rated for family viewing.

                ""All I ever wanted was for Juli Baker to leave me alone.""Flipped is easily the best love story/relationship movie I've seen since (500) Days of Summer. I'm the kind of guy that you couldn't pay to watch a Nicholas Sparks movie, but that doesn't mean that I can't appreciate a good movie about the highs and lows of love. In a year of formulaic, mind-numbing flicks with no imagination or heart like Letters to Juliet, Flipped is a welcome breath of fresh air. It's about 8 or so years in the lives of two kids who meet when when one of them moves into a new neighborhood. Juli (played by Morgan Lily and Madeline Carroll) is instantly smitten by Bryce (Ryan Ketzner and Callan McAuliffe) the second she sees him drive up to his new house. Bryce, being a typical second grade boy, finds her attention embarrassing and unwanted. As they get older, that dynamic between them remains pretty much the same, but we wouldn't have a very interesting movie if that's all there was to it. Eventually Bryce finds himself on the other side of the equation (flipped, get it?), and has to win back the girl he never knew he always wanted.How odd is it that a movie about a couple of kids handles the topic of love in a more mature and genuine way than almost all of the adult-oriented romantic comedies that we're buried under each year? There's no doubt about it that Flipped will make you say ""aww"" on occasion, but there's a lot more to it than just kids being cute. Humor, issues of class, family conflict, and the lost idealism of youth are introduced into the story by Bryce and Juli's respective families, and there are several outright bittersweet or poignant scenes within the story.The movie is shown from the POV's of both main characters, and often the same event will be shown from each of their perspectives. It works really well, as it really helps the viewer to ""get"" both Bryce and Juli. The kids chosen to play the older versions of the two (Carroll and McAuliffe) are both great, the fact that the story is set in 50's or 60's suburbia adds a believable sense of innocence to it all, and there is just a fresh feeling to the movie that I can't really describe with words.I heartily recommend this to anyone who likes a good, well-written movie, regardless of the genre. You can tell that a lot of heart went into making Flipped, and it shows. Great movie.

                'Flipped' is truly a ""real movie"". Probably what most people enjoyed about this movie was that the events that happened in the movie could might as well have been their reality. Many people in this world (if not all) have experienced having a real crush. This movie shows a crush blossoming from both a guy's and a girl's view. It was very interesting to see two viewpoints on this everyday happening. That is what makes this movie so appealing. Viewers get to watch Bryce and Juli's emotions whenever they see the other. Viewers see Bryce and Juli's smiles that they can't help. Viewers get to know who exactly Bryce and Juli are.Anyone and everyone will enjoy this movie or can at least, relate to it. Even adults! This film will surely take you down memory lane and help you remember the feelings you had when you were first in love. I've never experienced being in love before, but this film makes it seem wonderful. I absolutely loved this film.Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe were great in this film! Even if they're very young, they did wonderful jobs in performing here. In each of their scenes, you could sense the emotions that they were feeling and wanted to convey to the viewers. The characters themselves were also very interesting. Particularly Ms. Juli Baker. It was nice to see such a free-spirited teenager, who was very opinionated and didn't let anything stand in her way. The chemistry that both actors had were average. I thought that they showed their most potential when acting by themselves, in their own surroundings.I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that Rob Reiner, the director of this film, was the same person who directed 'When Harry Met Sally' and 'Sleepless in Seattle'. So far, all romantic-comedies that Rob Reiner has directed has not disappointed me. I can't wait for more of his works! All his rom-coms are excellent additions to the romance movie genre.This was an amazing teenage romantic comedy. Surely one of my favorites, right up there with 'When Harry Met Sally'. Do not miss this film. It's baffling to see that this film isn't as popular as it's supposed to be.Viewed on: April 5, 2011 ; December 16, 2011

                Juli just had to take one look at Bryce's blue eyes, and she knew it was true love. Bryce just had to take one notice of Juli's manic desperation, and he knew it was going to be a friendship of torment. I just had to take one look at the film's artfully designed poster, and I knew ""Flipped"" was a film to be savoured.A beautifully told film of first love, we flip from Juli's point of view to Bryce's point of view, very effectively giving us the true nature of their friendship, love and respect they have for each other. Except in the case of middle-school graders, that love and respect can frequently look like embarrassment, mistrust, and shame. All of those emotions are told with intelligence, subtlety and humour.""Flipped"" has all of the comedy, naiveté and bewilderment of first love. It takes the romantic comedy farther by actually giving us characters with real depth. There is more going on than just Juli and Bryce figuring out their love for each other, and every aspect of this film is well written, touching and relevant.""Flipped"" is a cute film for everybody who fondly remembers that fiercely independent girl or the guy with piercing blue eyes that lived across the street.

","
                ""Flipped"" is superbly directed by Rob Reiner and in my book, one of his best movies. It's a wonderfully told coming-of-age story, which I could relate to in many ways. The main two characters, Juli and Bryce, are very likable. Their parents, played by Penelope Ann Miller and Aidan Quinn, Rebecca de Mornay and Anthony Edwards, respectively, are believable in their roles, which they play excellently. I liked the fact that the story is told from two points of views, Bryce first and then Juli. If you want to see a really feel-good movie, instead of watching some dumb comedy or shoot 'em up flick, go see FLIPPED! You will not regret it.

                I just discovered this gem on Netflix and was impressed, moved and entertained. Its a romantic film about puppy love, so it may not be for everyone (even teens) but I found the leads to be charming and charismatic. The plot device is nothing new, but the charm and early 60's setting make it fresh in many ways. A wonderful cast led by the young leads (now grown!), the late John Mahoney and Aidan Quinn help make this film watchable and enjoyable. A wholesome movie with wonderful moments.

                The first few minutes sent me back a decade reminding how much we avoided girls or getting our names attached to one..I really liked how the story showed a basic fact (mostly at least) :""The one you love doesn't love you back, and you don't love the one that loves you!""Though the main story is not that all can relate to, the background or the base of the story was really nice. The character development was good, not like many movies which focus on only the main characters. Though the story was a little predictable, the movie is enjoyable and among a few to which we can relate to.This movie is definitely worth a watch.And it deserves an 8 out of 10.

","
                Back in 1973, an episode of ""All in the Family"" told the same story from three different perspectives, one of which was from the point of view of Mike ""Meathead"" Stivic, played by Rob Reiner. Watching his latest directorial effort, I wondered if the ""he said / she said"" gimmick of that episode (""Everybody Tells the Truth"") was what attracted Reiner to ""Flipped,"" the young-adult novel by Wendelin Van Draanen, which employs the same multi-POV technique that Lawrence Durrell perfected with his ""Alexandria Quartet"" in the late 1950s. The film version of ""Flipped"" shows Reiner at the top of his form, a worthy addition to an ouevre that includes such classics as ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" ""Misery,"" ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Stand By Me,"" the 1986 period piece that ""Flipped"" most recalls, with its younger characters and coming-of-age theme. At the heart of ""Flipped"" is Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll), a smart, pretty and thoughtful girl who you just can't help losing your heart to. Juli herself flips for Bryce Loski, who is at first repelled by Juli and then slowly starts to see her for the lovely person she is. The cast is augmented by such pros as John Mahoney (Frasier's dad on ""Cheers""), Anthony Edwards, Aidan Quinn and Rebecca De Mornay and Penelope Ann Miller. The film offers up various slices of life from the late '50s and early '60s that makes for a nostalgic, romantic and very moving film. Special kudos to the filmmakers for finding a girl to play young Juli (Morgan Lily) who looks chillingly like Madeline Carroll; I would have bet anything the two were sisters. For those who are bored by the dumb-dumb summer comedies of 2010 (""The Other Guys,"" ""Dinner for Schmucks"") and the special-effects hijinks of ""Inception,"" this is a tender and emotionally satisfying journey that will stay with you for years.

                I really, really liked this film and now wonder why it didn't make more impact when it debuted. Perhaps it was just one of those films that slipped between the cracks because ""Flipped"" is a wonderful coming of age film--and is among director Rob Reiner's best.The film is set mostly in the early 1960s. A young boy, Bryce, moves to a new neighborhood and almost instantly the girl across the street, Juli, begins mooning over him and acting like she's infatuated with him. But he's 7--and hating girls and mushy stuff is normal and he resists her charms. But she persists as the years pass--and she's convinced herself that Bryce is her dream boy. But, as the years pass, Bryce is just as convinced that Juli is a pest. However, eventually, Bryce's attitude starts to change...too bad Juli's is as well!This is a remarkable film in so many ways. The direction is wonderful--perfectly paced and very sweet. The writing is also exceptionally sweet and enchanting. It also helped that there were some wonderful supporting actors to assist in telling the story-- some characters you really liked and cared about and a couple who were complete jerks. John Mahoney was particularly good, but the entire cast was wonderful in this movie. Overall, the elements all work together to tell a sweet story that anyone could love. My only quibble, and it's a very minor one, is about the music. Too many older films are saturated with oldies music. While a bit is nice, with some it sounds more like a best of record album...and at times I would have preferred ""Flipped"" to have been a bit quieter. Not a major complaint by any means and I still give this film a well deserved 9.

                Okay, let's dispense immediately with the idea that this film is geared toward teenagers and all of their sap that they go through. I assure you ""mature adults"" out there that this film will delight you also, unless you are a completely hopelessly lost Scrooge. This film should make sense to all ages. Everyone should identify with it. I don't care what kind of a snob, low-life, big wig, or puritan you are, you should enjoy this film. It's never too sappy when it deals with matters of the heart, nor is it too blunt and insensitive.The film is told almost entirely in a voice over of one of the two main characters. It's told in a brilliant he-said she-said style where the same scene is often told twice from the two opposite points of view (Juli's and Bryce's). So we see the opening scene twice. The first time as explained by Bryce, and the second time explained by Juli. This sort of formula is used many a time in the unfolding battle of the sexes. Of course this doesn't happen in every scene—that would get boring. Director Reiner gives us the proper dosage of everything in this film. The proper amount of comedy, romance, and the proper amount of sadness. Never is it sappy or indulgent or even presumptuous. It's a perfect film for what it's worth. The screenplay is absolutely the work of a fine craftsman—or craftsmen Andrew Scheinman and director Reiner. I don't know how long it took to write or how much blood went into it, but this film is the result of excellent work in every department. The two child stars are perfect in their roles (although Bryce could have done better), but the strength of the cast are in supporting actors. The cast is full of great actors, particularly Anthony Edwards as Bryce's arrogant, critical, smart-Aleck father, and the ever-welcome Aidan Quinn as Juli's loving, down-to-earth, tree painting father.I wasn't completely convinced of the excellence of the film until a beautiful scene in which Mr. Baker (Quinn) and Juli go to visit Mr. Baker's mentally retarded brother Daniel, who is so happy with the world and everything in it. But this scene can't be expressed in words, you have to see it. For what it's worth, Flipped is somewhat of a deep film, full of parallels to the real world. All of the characters have the proper amount of development, even the big sycamore tree that Juli likes to sit in and watch the sunrise. Her exploits while up in that tree are so poetic and beautiful when matched up with the pictures on screen. It's a beautiful and insightful scene into the thoughts and feelings of people in general, not just a teenage girl.In this day when films are almost all big-budget action movies with loud explosions, Flipped has explosions of its own kind. It has explosions of heart and feeling and character, all at the appropriate times. I did not find any ax to grind here. Other than the characters, plot, and screenplay, it's also a technically beautiful film. The camera captures everything so clearly with the proper color timing and excellently framed shots. After the mid-way point of the film, being surrounded by excellence, one starts to look for any reason to criticize the film. I found none. Every nuance of the film is done so genteelly and honestly, who can have a problem with it? This film achieves what movies are meant to achieve. They are meant to reach into are minds and draw us in, to entertain and to move us with fright, emotion, tears, laughs, whatever may be the subject. They are meant to create a world around us, whether in space, in the Wild West, in the future, in Bible times, or in the case of Flipped in 1960s suburbia. This film does exactly what it is meant to do. To touch and make us laugh and to remember. That's what it does. It makes us remember what happened or is happening to us. No one can give this a bad review. I don't see how anyone can pick a fight with the film. But I'm blabbing about nothing.In short, Flipped is by far the best film I've seen this year. I do hope the Academy doesn't overlook this like they do so many other ""family"" films. It should at least get a few nominations, if not a win. We'll see what happens. It's only July.www.colewebbharter.com

                This is a coming of age film set initially and briefly in the late 1950s and mostly in the early 1960s. The boy, Bryce, is chased by his neighbor girl, Juli. And is he chased! Juli is immediately smitten or ""flipped"" by Bryce's eyes and the story unfolds.What is unusual about the story telling is that each major event is played back twice - once through the eyes and voice of Bryce and once through the eyes and voice of Juli. It's the same scene, but you wouldn't know that from their differing viewpoints.Juli is the adventurous and interesting one. Bryce just wants to fit in at their Junior High School. Juli slowly begins to unlike Bryce and Bryce slowly begins to appreciate Juli. Will they ever meet at the same emotional place at the same time? That is the drama and story.The art direction and era are right on. It is the Eisenhower and Kennedy years in look, and even in feel. The wives are subordinate to the husbands. The children are mostly respectful to their parents. And the teachers teach and the students learn. But, you can see the seeds being laid for the rebellious war babies of the late 1960s.Rob Reiner is a talented director for romances - ""When Harry Met Sally."" And he is a talented director for handling young actors - ""Stand By Me."" He combines these talents to help us understand the better part of the human condition; that is, love, respect, sacrifice, forgiveness, and honor. And we have fun and laugh along the way. This is like the TV program, ""Wonder Years"" - but heightened and deepened.-Bob, a Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award Jury Member

                Flipped is a one in a million film - I mean, REALLY one in a million. It's refreshing and lovely, dramatic and hilarious. It does what few films do in our time (or rather what they don't do): Flipped does not sacrifice its integrity for raunchy, gratuitous content. It's real. The emotions are real. The characters are real. And while it certainly isn't G-rated fluff (and do not be fooled - this is not a film for young children), the movie is definitely gentle and innocent in many ways. On the downside, without giving anything away, the ending of the film could have been better patched together, but overall the movie is a cinematic gem like no other. Go see Flipped!

Outstanding use of period music. Great collection of shinning '57 Chevy's.Courage, family values, character and nothing explodes. People of every age are treated with respect.

                Beautifully told with all the ingredients for a good family movie. The story is told from two different views, the view from the boy and from the girl. A boy who is annoyed by all the attention he gets from the girl across the street. The girl from across the street who has a super crush on the boy tells her part of the story. The boy's father is a man filled with hatred who dispenses politically incorrect lines throughout the movie. The grandfather, the great John Mohoney, is the wise person who tells the boy to really see the girl for what she is, a very special girl. I don't want to give anything away of this jewel of a movie. I enjoyed this movie very much and totally recommend it.

                A very enjoyable movie, effectively embracing the coming of age sensitivities which come to us all. Although it is clear there are many nuances of other characters which never get dealt with, it's meant to be that way. This is about the kids, the effect they have on one another, their ability and inability to express their feelings, and what can happen when we finally face our fears about the other sex and dare to take a step toward resolving them. The only issue I have is that the film simply has too many anachronisms -- songs not of the period and figures of speech clearly from the present and not the fifties and sixties, but hey, I'm too darn picky about that stuff. Reiner has done it again, offering us a film in the style and tone of Capra. He has crafted a film of sensitivity and grace, and taught us something about life that most of us lose upon becoming adults. Madeline Carroll is simply wonderful as the independent teen taking life head on, and is a true pleasure to watch. She absolutely carries this film.

                Of all the movies I've seen lately, Flipped was amongst the most refreshing. If it had been done by a different director and had different screenwriters, it might be a terrible cliché. Story of first love, known each other since kids, bla bla bla, we've all heard it before.But this movie, it was so pure and so realistic, which is what I love about it most. It wasn't over the top romantic, but it was enough to tug my heartstrings and made me go ""awwww"" instead of going ""ewwww"".The characters felt like real people, and the issues faced in the story felt so real and believable, it made me believe in the basic form of love once more, and that it still existed in real life (even though I know it's just in the movies, but still).Anyway, if you're looking for a story that is refreshing yet vintage, and wanting to have a lovey-dovey grin plastered on your face, then this is the movie to watch.

","
                Flipped is a sweet, charming, moving, lovely, well-acted coming-of-age romantic drama comedy film.While the plot offers nothing new in particular (as with mostly all rom- com films)...the 'girl meets boy' mixed with 'the not-your-typical girl next door' story, but the storytelling is slightly different. Adapted from the book with the same name by Wendelin Van Draanen, the film is presented in a rather unique 'he-said she-said' style, through the eyes and thoughts of the male lead, Bryce and then again through the eyes and thoughts of female lead, Juli, alternately presenting their views and perspectives on a shared set of events. Nearly every single event that happened in the film is told at least twice, although it seems repetitive, but surprisingly, it never feels boring or annoying. It's actually fascinating and insightful to be able to see into the thoughts and feelings of people in general. Things are not really what it seems and there's always more than meets the eye. As the film progresses, you are so emotionally invested in the characters that you actually begin to eagerly anticipate what the other side of the story might be, how the other person feels the way he/she does. The film also gives a feeling of nostalgia, even for those who never lived in the era (the story is set in 50's or 60's suburban area) or experienced the same events as the two leads. It feels authentic and relatable nonetheless. Juli might appear as an ordinary girl, but she's a sweet, kind, beautiful, daring girl at heart once you get to know her.The two lead stars are perfect in their respective roles. Most of the characters in the film have sufficient character development for the audience to understand them. Flipped is a period young love story, told in a simple and heartfelt manner. A rare cinematic gem.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/shorter-movie-review-flipped.html Rating: 8/10""A painting is more than the sum of its parts. A cow by itself is just a cow.

                I feel that this is not a movie about love and first love, but how people should treat themselves and others who seem to be incompatible with their surroundings, how to face the embarrassment and difficulties in life, and learn and grow.

","
                Flipped is a coming of age film directed by the coming of age master director Rob Reiner. Reiner directed the tear-jerker Stand By Me and is now back to bring Wendelin Van Draanen's novel of the same name to life. What a treat! Flipped and Stand By Me both make me wish my childhood was full of more adventure and fun rather than just me sitting on the computer writing review after review aspiring to be a critic. I get tears in my eyes to both films because I become so attached to the characters and they're living the life I can only dream to have. With the exception of unfaithful parents when it comes to Stand By Me.What came to mind halfway through the film was why couldn't the movie Speak have been this good? This film proves more than 80% can be done by narration from TWO characters different perspective and it can be done well. Why not do the same for Speak? Most of the dialog in this film is internal and not directly word of mouth and it works. Why not treat Speak the same way? Were they afraid they would mess it up? It begs an explanation to why Laurie Halse Anderson's novel's potential on film was unfaithful to it's film companion.Never reading the book, I do know that it was set in the nineties and the two thousands while this film's setting is in the late fifties and early sixties. It's not that big of a deal with the drastic setting change, but maybe I would've been more upset if I was a huge fan of the book to find out the film was set four years in the past.The movie about Bryce Loski (McAuliffe), a kid who moves into the neighborhood at a young age to immediately become eye candy to his new neighbor Juli Baker (Carroll). Bryce is resistant, while Juli is persistent. She is positive Bryce will give her her first kiss and believes Bryce is just a little shy, when really he wants nothing to do with her. Juli continues up until present day middle school to give Bryce the chance to admit his ""feelings"" for her but doesn't.Juli lives across the street from Bryce and her yard is an eyesore. It's paid for by the landlord since most of the money Juli and her family makes is given to Juli's father's mentally challenged brother. Bryce's family, his dad mostly, is annoyed by Juli and her family's crappy yard and continue to bad mouth and make assumptions about the Baker family when they really have no idea what it's like over there.The film is narrated by both leads more often than not. Usually we'll get five minutes or so of Bryce narrating his side of the story, while Juli narrates her's. It's almost an anthology because we see what goes on from Bryce's standpoint while hearing his thoughts at the moment and then we see what happened prior or after the events of Bryce's because we then go to Juli. It's confusing. But it works all the time.At the beginning of the film I thought the narrations were only used for the audience to get affiliated with the lives of the characters and what happened before we got here. We spend ninety minutes or longer with movie characters and some films don't even give you the damn courtesy to provide us with any kind of background information. We are supposed to just be thrown into a film with characters we sometimes don't even find out the last names to.The one minor problem I have with the film is the end. It leaves off on the wrong note. The film is only ninety minutes when it could and should be longer. The place they ended was fine, but the scenes on the DVD cover and poster never occur in the film. What a letdown.Flipped is 2010's underrated masterpiece and it definitely showcases a worthy coming of age film. It's smooth style of directing, great music, calm feeling even at it's most stressful, and strong leads are more than I could've asked for. Rob Reiner is something else. A true talent in the movie business. Especially when making a movie as heartfelt as this one.Starring: Callan McAuliffe, Madeline Carroll, Rebecca De Mornay, Anthony Edwards, John Mahoney, Penelope Ann Miller, Aidan Quinn, and Kevin Weisman. Directed by: Rob Reiner.

                With a technique borrowed from Casino of the story being told from two different protagonist points of view, Rob Reiner gives us a wonderful family film about first love. Flipped is a lot less bloody and a great deal sweeter than Martin Scorsese's gangster classic.The prosperous Loski family moves into the neighborhood where the ne'er do well Bakers live. On that day in the late fifties the kids that grow up to be Callan McAuliffe and Madeline Carroll set eyes on each other. Carroll thinks McAuliffe is the one, but such decisions at the age of 7 are sometimes reconsidered. And McAuliffe can't see her for beans, she's just an annoying girl which is not atypical for the second grade.Moving into junior high school is a different matter. With the onset of puberty both these kids are experiencing conflicting emotions. McAuliffe acts like a jerk sometimes, Carroll expects a bit much.The families are different. Anthony Edwards who is McAuliffe's dad is a bit of a fathead and has a thing about his neighbor's lifestyle. Their yard contains a chicken coop and is not in good shape and it's bringing down the values of the other property on the block. As for Aidan Quinn who is Carroll's dad and his family lives as it does in order to support his brother who lives in a sanitarium, an expensive private one for the mentally retarded. Quinn is a wonderful dad, but the Bakers live a whole lot like the Micawbers waiting for something to turn up.The women are wiser than the men, Rebecca DeMornay and Penelope Ann Miller the wives of Edwards and Quinn respectively bond. McAuliffe also has the wisdom of his maternal grandfather John Mahoney to lean on. He's a surrogate grandfather to Carroll as well.Rob Reiner came up with a real winner. The kids act like real kids as opposed to Hollywood kids. The grownups are neither all wise Deities or complete idiots. The women young and old do come out better than the men. I think everyone is going to like this one.Flipped is highly rated for family viewing.

                Loved it. Bryce is so handsome, i could totally empathize with Juli when she would talk about his dazzling eyes. And then when Bryce did some really mean things to her, I could once again totally empathize with Juli and thought he was a complete jerk. The whole story was very relatable to me in general. Wonderful movie.

                ""All I ever wanted was for Juli Baker to leave me alone.""Flipped is easily the best love story/relationship movie I've seen since (500) Days of Summer. I'm the kind of guy that you couldn't pay to watch a Nicholas Sparks movie, but that doesn't mean that I can't appreciate a good movie about the highs and lows of love. In a year of formulaic, mind-numbing flicks with no imagination or heart like Letters to Juliet, Flipped is a welcome breath of fresh air. It's about 8 or so years in the lives of two kids who meet when when one of them moves into a new neighborhood. Juli (played by Morgan Lily and Madeline Carroll) is instantly smitten by Bryce (Ryan Ketzner and Callan McAuliffe) the second she sees him drive up to his new house. Bryce, being a typical second grade boy, finds her attention embarrassing and unwanted. As they get older, that dynamic between them remains pretty much the same, but we wouldn't have a very interesting movie if that's all there was to it. Eventually Bryce finds himself on the other side of the equation (flipped, get it?), and has to win back the girl he never knew he always wanted.How odd is it that a movie about a couple of kids handles the topic of love in a more mature and genuine way than almost all of the adult-oriented romantic comedies that we're buried under each year? There's no doubt about it that Flipped will make you say ""aww"" on occasion, but there's a lot more to it than just kids being cute. Humor, issues of class, family conflict, and the lost idealism of youth are introduced into the story by Bryce and Juli's respective families, and there are several outright bittersweet or poignant scenes within the story.The movie is shown from the POV's of both main characters, and often the same event will be shown from each of their perspectives. It works really well, as it really helps the viewer to ""get"" both Bryce and Juli. The kids chosen to play the older versions of the two (Carroll and McAuliffe) are both great, the fact that the story is set in 50's or 60's suburbia adds a believable sense of innocence to it all, and there is just a fresh feeling to the movie that I can't really describe with words.I heartily recommend this to anyone who likes a good, well-written movie, regardless of the genre. You can tell that a lot of heart went into making Flipped, and it shows. Great movie.

                'Flipped' is truly a ""real movie"". Probably what most people enjoyed about this movie was that the events that happened in the movie could might as well have been their reality. Many people in this world (if not all) have experienced having a real crush. This movie shows a crush blossoming from both a guy's and a girl's view. It was very interesting to see two viewpoints on this everyday happening. That is what makes this movie so appealing. Viewers get to watch Bryce and Juli's emotions whenever they see the other. Viewers see Bryce and Juli's smiles that they can't help. Viewers get to know who exactly Bryce and Juli are.Anyone and everyone will enjoy this movie or can at least, relate to it. Even adults! This film will surely take you down memory lane and help you remember the feelings you had when you were first in love. I've never experienced being in love before, but this film makes it seem wonderful. I absolutely loved this film.Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe were great in this film! Even if they're very young, they did wonderful jobs in performing here. In each of their scenes, you could sense the emotions that they were feeling and wanted to convey to the viewers. The characters themselves were also very interesting. Particularly Ms. Juli Baker. It was nice to see such a free-spirited teenager, who was very opinionated and didn't let anything stand in her way. The chemistry that both actors had were average. I thought that they showed their most potential when acting by themselves, in their own surroundings.I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that Rob Reiner, the director of this film, was the same person who directed 'When Harry Met Sally' and 'Sleepless in Seattle'. So far, all romantic-comedies that Rob Reiner has directed has not disappointed me. I can't wait for more of his works! All his rom-coms are excellent additions to the romance movie genre.This was an amazing teenage romantic comedy. Surely one of my favorites, right up there with 'When Harry Met Sally'. Do not miss this film. It's baffling to see that this film isn't as popular as it's supposed to be.Viewed on: April 5, 2011 ; December 16, 2011

                Juli just had to take one look at Bryce's blue eyes, and she knew it was true love. Bryce just had to take one notice of Juli's manic desperation, and he knew it was going to be a friendship of torment. I just had to take one look at the film's artfully designed poster, and I knew ""Flipped"" was a film to be savoured.A beautifully told film of first love, we flip from Juli's point of view to Bryce's point of view, very effectively giving us the true nature of their friendship, love and respect they have for each other. Except in the case of middle-school graders, that love and respect can frequently look like embarrassment, mistrust, and shame. All of those emotions are told with intelligence, subtlety and humour.""Flipped"" has all of the comedy, naiveté and bewilderment of first love. It takes the romantic comedy farther by actually giving us characters with real depth. There is more going on than just Juli and Bryce figuring out their love for each other, and every aspect of this film is well written, touching and relevant.""Flipped"" is a cute film for everybody who fondly remembers that fiercely independent girl or the guy with piercing blue eyes that lived across the street.

                ""Flipped"" is superbly directed by Rob Reiner and in my book, one of his best movies. It's a wonderfully told coming-of-age story, which I could relate to in many ways. The main two characters, Juli and Bryce, are very likable. Their parents, played by Penelope Ann Miller and Aidan Quinn, Rebecca de Mornay and Anthony Edwards, respectively, are believable in their roles, which they play excellently. I liked the fact that the story is told from two points of views, Bryce first and then Juli. If you want to see a really feel-good movie, instead of watching some dumb comedy or shoot 'em up flick, go see FLIPPED! You will not regret it.

                I just discovered this gem on Netflix and was impressed, moved and entertained. Its a romantic film about puppy love, so it may not be for everyone (even teens) but I found the leads to be charming and charismatic. The plot device is nothing new, but the charm and early 60's setting make it fresh in many ways. A wonderful cast led by the young leads (now grown!), the late John Mahoney and Aidan Quinn help make this film watchable and enjoyable. A wholesome movie with wonderful moments.

The character development was good, not like many movies which focus on only the main characters.

                Back in 1973, an episode of ""All in the Family"" told the same story from three different perspectives, one of which was from the point of view of Mike ""Meathead"" Stivic, played by Rob Reiner. Watching his latest directorial effort, I wondered if the ""he said / she said"" gimmick of that episode (""Everybody Tells the Truth"") was what attracted Reiner to ""Flipped,"" the young-adult novel by Wendelin Van Draanen, which employs the same multi-POV technique that Lawrence Durrell perfected with his ""Alexandria Quartet"" in the late 1950s. The film version of ""Flipped"" shows Reiner at the top of his form, a worthy addition to an ouevre that includes such classics as ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" ""Misery,"" ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Stand By Me,"" the 1986 period piece that ""Flipped"" most recalls, with its younger characters and coming-of-age theme. At the heart of ""Flipped"" is Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll), a smart, pretty and thoughtful girl who you just can't help losing your heart to. Juli herself flips for Bryce Loski, who is at first repelled by Juli and then slowly starts to see her for the lovely person she is. The cast is augmented by such pros as John Mahoney (Frasier's dad on ""Cheers""), Anthony Edwards, Aidan Quinn and Rebecca De Mornay and Penelope Ann Miller. The film offers up various slices of life from the late '50s and early '60s that makes for a nostalgic, romantic and very moving film. Special kudos to the filmmakers for finding a girl to play young Juli (Morgan Lily) who looks chillingly like Madeline Carroll; I would have bet anything the two were sisters. For those who are bored by the dumb-dumb summer comedies of 2010 (""The Other Guys,"" ""Dinner for Schmucks"") and the special-effects hijinks of ""Inception,"" this is a tender and emotionally satisfying journey that will stay with you for years.

                I really, really liked this film and now wonder why it didn't make more impact when it debuted. Perhaps it was just one of those films that slipped between the cracks because ""Flipped"" is a wonderful coming of age film--and is among director Rob Reiner's best.The film is set mostly in the early 1960s. A young boy, Bryce, moves to a new neighborhood and almost instantly the girl across the street, Juli, begins mooning over him and acting like she's infatuated with him. But he's 7--and hating girls and mushy stuff is normal and he resists her charms. But she persists as the years pass--and she's convinced herself that Bryce is her dream boy. But, as the years pass, Bryce is just as convinced that Juli is a pest. However, eventually, Bryce's attitude starts to change...too bad Juli's is as well!This is a remarkable film in so many ways. The direction is wonderful--perfectly paced and very sweet. The writing is also exceptionally sweet and enchanting. It also helped that there were some wonderful supporting actors to assist in telling the story-- some characters you really liked and cared about and a couple who were complete jerks. John Mahoney was particularly good, but the entire cast was wonderful in this movie. Overall, the elements all work together to tell a sweet story that anyone could love. My only quibble, and it's a very minor one, is about the music. Too many older films are saturated with oldies music. While a bit is nice, with some it sounds more like a best of record album...and at times I would have preferred ""Flipped"" to have been a bit quieter. Not a major complaint by any means and I still give this film a well deserved 9.

                Okay, let's dispense immediately with the idea that this film is geared toward teenagers and all of their sap that they go through. I assure you ""mature adults"" out there that this film will delight you also, unless you are a completely hopelessly lost Scrooge. This film should make sense to all ages. Everyone should identify with it. I don't care what kind of a snob, low-life, big wig, or puritan you are, you should enjoy this film. It's never too sappy when it deals with matters of the heart, nor is it too blunt and insensitive.The film is told almost entirely in a voice over of one of the two main characters. It's told in a brilliant he-said she-said style where the same scene is often told twice from the two opposite points of view (Juli's and Bryce's). So we see the opening scene twice. The first time as explained by Bryce, and the second time explained by Juli. This sort of formula is used many a time in the unfolding battle of the sexes. Of course this doesn't happen in every scene—that would get boring. Director Reiner gives us the proper dosage of everything in this film. The proper amount of comedy, romance, and the proper amount of sadness. Never is it sappy or indulgent or even presumptuous. It's a perfect film for what it's worth. The screenplay is absolutely the work of a fine craftsman—or craftsmen Andrew Scheinman and director Reiner. I don't know how long it took to write or how much blood went into it, but this film is the result of excellent work in every department. The two child stars are perfect in their roles (although Bryce could have done better), but the strength of the cast are in supporting actors. The cast is full of great actors, particularly Anthony Edwards as Bryce's arrogant, critical, smart-Aleck father, and the ever-welcome Aidan Quinn as Juli's loving, down-to-earth, tree painting father.I wasn't completely convinced of the excellence of the film until a beautiful scene in which Mr. Baker (Quinn) and Juli go to visit Mr. Baker's mentally retarded brother Daniel, who is so happy with the world and everything in it. But this scene can't be expressed in words, you have to see it. For what it's worth, Flipped is somewhat of a deep film, full of parallels to the real world. All of the characters have the proper amount of development, even the big sycamore tree that Juli likes to sit in and watch the sunrise. Her exploits while up in that tree are so poetic and beautiful when matched up with the pictures on screen. It's a beautiful and insightful scene into the thoughts and feelings of people in general, not just a teenage girl.In this day when films are almost all big-budget action movies with loud explosions, Flipped has explosions of its own kind. It has explosions of heart and feeling and character, all at the appropriate times. I did not find any ax to grind here. Other than the characters, plot, and screenplay, it's also a technically beautiful film. The camera captures everything so clearly with the proper color timing and excellently framed shots. After the mid-way point of the film, being surrounded by excellence, one starts to look for any reason to criticize the film. I found none. Every nuance of the film is done so genteelly and honestly, who can have a problem with it? This film achieves what movies are meant to achieve. They are meant to reach into are minds and draw us in, to entertain and to move us with fright, emotion, tears, laughs, whatever may be the subject. They are meant to create a world around us, whether in space, in the Wild West, in the future, in Bible times, or in the case of Flipped in 1960s suburbia. This film does exactly what it is meant to do. To touch and make us laugh and to remember. That's what it does. It makes us remember what happened or is happening to us. No one can give this a bad review. I don't see how anyone can pick a fight with the film. But I'm blabbing about nothing.In short, Flipped is by far the best film I've seen this year. I do hope the Academy doesn't overlook this like they do so many other ""family"" films. It should at least get a few nominations, if not a win. We'll see what happens. It's only July.www.colewebbharter.com

                This is a coming of age film set initially and briefly in the late 1950s and mostly in the early 1960s. The boy, Bryce, is chased by his neighbor girl, Juli. And is he chased! Juli is immediately smitten or ""flipped"" by Bryce's eyes and the story unfolds.What is unusual about the story telling is that each major event is played back twice - once through the eyes and voice of Bryce and once through the eyes and voice of Juli. It's the same scene, but you wouldn't know that from their differing viewpoints.Juli is the adventurous and interesting one. Bryce just wants to fit in at their Junior High School. Juli slowly begins to unlike Bryce and Bryce slowly begins to appreciate Juli. Will they ever meet at the same emotional place at the same time? That is the drama and story.The art direction and era are right on. It is the Eisenhower and Kennedy years in look, and even in feel. The wives are subordinate to the husbands. The children are mostly respectful to their parents. And the teachers teach and the students learn. But, you can see the seeds being laid for the rebellious war babies of the late 1960s.Rob Reiner is a talented director for romances - ""When Harry Met Sally."" And he is a talented director for handling young actors - ""Stand By Me."" He combines these talents to help us understand the better part of the human condition; that is, love, respect, sacrifice, forgiveness, and honor. And we have fun and laugh along the way. This is like the TV program, ""Wonder Years"" - but heightened and deepened.-Bob, a Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award Jury Member

                Flipped is a one in a million film - I mean, REALLY one in a million. It's refreshing and lovely, dramatic and hilarious. It does what few films do in our time (or rather what they don't do): Flipped does not sacrifice its integrity for raunchy, gratuitous content. It's real. The emotions are real. The characters are real. And while it certainly isn't G-rated fluff (and do not be fooled - this is not a film for young children), the movie is definitely gentle and innocent in many ways. On the downside, without giving anything away, the ending of the film could have been better patched together, but overall the movie is a cinematic gem like no other. Go see Flipped!

                Juli flipped over Bryce. Bryce's dad flips out. Mom and sister wear their hair in a flip.Charming tale told in a ""he said she said"" often voice-over manner. Interesting enough and short enough so the style doesn't detract. Don't let the print ads mislead you. Bryce never climbs the tree.Excellent performances from the entire cast. Outstanding use of period music. Great collection of shinning '57 Chevy's.Courage, family values, character and nothing explodes. People of every age are treated with respect. What a refreshing movie. Archie Bunker was wrong, Rob Reiner got it right again. He's no meat-head.

                Beautifully told with all the ingredients for a good family movie. The story is told from two different views, the view from the boy and from the girl. A boy who is annoyed by all the attention he gets from the girl across the street. The girl from across the street who has a super crush on the boy tells her part of the story. The boy's father is a man filled with hatred who dispenses politically incorrect lines throughout the movie. The grandfather, the great John Mohoney, is the wise person who tells the boy to really see the girl for what she is, a very special girl. I don't want to give anything away of this jewel of a movie. I enjoyed this movie very much and totally recommend it.

Also,I bought this impressive American novel last year,which is as great as the movie.

                A very enjoyable movie, effectively embracing the coming of age sensitivities which come to us all. Although it is clear there are many nuances of other characters which never get dealt with, it's meant to be that way. This is about the kids, the effect they have on one another, their ability and inability to express their feelings, and what can happen when we finally face our fears about the other sex and dare to take a step toward resolving them. The only issue I have is that the film simply has too many anachronisms -- songs not of the period and figures of speech clearly from the present and not the fifties and sixties, but hey, I'm too darn picky about that stuff. Reiner has done it again, offering us a film in the style and tone of Capra. He has crafted a film of sensitivity and grace, and taught us something about life that most of us lose upon becoming adults. Madeline Carroll is simply wonderful as the independent teen taking life head on, and is a true pleasure to watch. She absolutely carries this film.

                Of all the movies I've seen lately, Flipped was amongst the most refreshing. If it had been done by a different director and had different screenwriters, it might be a terrible cliché. Story of first love, known each other since kids, bla bla bla, we've all heard it before.But this movie, it was so pure and so realistic, which is what I love about it most. It wasn't over the top romantic, but it was enough to tug my heartstrings and made me go ""awwww"" instead of going ""ewwww"".The characters felt like real people, and the issues faced in the story felt so real and believable, it made me believe in the basic form of love once more, and that it still existed in real life (even though I know it's just in the movies, but still).Anyway, if you're looking for a story that is refreshing yet vintage, and wanting to have a lovey-dovey grin plastered on your face, then this is the movie to watch.

                Flipped is a sweet, charming, moving, lovely, well-acted coming-of-age romantic drama comedy film.While the plot offers nothing new in particular (as with mostly all rom- com films)...the 'girl meets boy' mixed with 'the not-your-typical girl next door' story, but the storytelling is slightly different. Adapted from the book with the same name by Wendelin Van Draanen, the film is presented in a rather unique 'he-said she-said' style, through the eyes and thoughts of the male lead, Bryce and then again through the eyes and thoughts of female lead, Juli, alternately presenting their views and perspectives on a shared set of events. Nearly every single event that happened in the film is told at least twice, although it seems repetitive, but surprisingly, it never feels boring or annoying. It's actually fascinating and insightful to be able to see into the thoughts and feelings of people in general. Things are not really what it seems and there's always more than meets the eye. As the film progresses, you are so emotionally invested in the characters that you actually begin to eagerly anticipate what the other side of the story might be, how the other person feels the way he/she does. The film also gives a feeling of nostalgia, even for those who never lived in the era (the story is set in 50's or 60's suburban area) or experienced the same events as the two leads. It feels authentic and relatable nonetheless. Juli might appear as an ordinary girl, but she's a sweet, kind, beautiful, daring girl at heart once you get to know her.The two lead stars are perfect in their respective roles. Most of the characters in the film have sufficient character development for the audience to understand them. Flipped is a period young love story, told in a simple and heartfelt manner. A rare cinematic gem.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/shorter-movie-review-flipped.html Rating: 8/10""A painting is more than the sum of its parts. A cow by itself is just a cow.

                Flipped is a coming of age film directed by the coming of age master director Rob Reiner. Reiner directed the tear-jerker Stand By Me and is now back to bring Wendelin Van Draanen's novel of the same name to life. What a treat! Flipped and Stand By Me both make me wish my childhood was full of more adventure and fun rather than just me sitting on the computer writing review after review aspiring to be a critic. I get tears in my eyes to both films because I become so attached to the characters and they're living the life I can only dream to have. With the exception of unfaithful parents when it comes to Stand By Me.What came to mind halfway through the film was why couldn't the movie Speak have been this good? This film proves more than 80% can be done by narration from TWO characters different perspective and it can be done well. Why not do the same for Speak? Most of the dialog in this film is internal and not directly word of mouth and it works. Why not treat Speak the same way? Were they afraid they would mess it up? It begs an explanation to why Laurie Halse Anderson's novel's potential on film was unfaithful to it's film companion.Never reading the book, I do know that it was set in the nineties and the two thousands while this film's setting is in the late fifties and early sixties. It's not that big of a deal with the drastic setting change, but maybe I would've been more upset if I was a huge fan of the book to find out the film was set four years in the past.The movie about Bryce Loski (McAuliffe), a kid who moves into the neighborhood at a young age to immediately become eye candy to his new neighbor Juli Baker (Carroll). Bryce is resistant, while Juli is persistent. She is positive Bryce will give her her first kiss and believes Bryce is just a little shy, when really he wants nothing to do with her. Juli continues up until present day middle school to give Bryce the chance to admit his ""feelings"" for her but doesn't.Juli lives across the street from Bryce and her yard is an eyesore. It's paid for by the landlord since most of the money Juli and her family makes is given to Juli's father's mentally challenged brother. Bryce's family, his dad mostly, is annoyed by Juli and her family's crappy yard and continue to bad mouth and make assumptions about the Baker family when they really have no idea what it's like over there.The film is narrated by both leads more often than not. Usually we'll get five minutes or so of Bryce narrating his side of the story, while Juli narrates her's. It's almost an anthology because we see what goes on from Bryce's standpoint while hearing his thoughts at the moment and then we see what happened prior or after the events of Bryce's because we then go to Juli. It's confusing. But it works all the time.At the beginning of the film I thought the narrations were only used for the audience to get affiliated with the lives of the characters and what happened before we got here. We spend ninety minutes or longer with movie characters and some films don't even give you the damn courtesy to provide us with any kind of background information. We are supposed to just be thrown into a film with characters we sometimes don't even find out the last names to.The one minor problem I have with the film is the end. It leaves off on the wrong note. The film is only ninety minutes when it could and should be longer. The place they ended was fine, but the scenes on the DVD cover and poster never occur in the film. What a letdown.Flipped is 2010's underrated masterpiece and it definitely showcases a worthy coming of age film. It's smooth style of directing, great music, calm feeling even at it's most stressful, and strong leads are more than I could've asked for. Rob Reiner is something else. A true talent in the movie business. Especially when making a movie as heartfelt as this one.Starring: Callan McAuliffe, Madeline Carroll, Rebecca De Mornay, Anthony Edwards, John Mahoney, Penelope Ann Miller, Aidan Quinn, and Kevin Weisman. Directed by: Rob Reiner.

                With a technique borrowed from Casino of the story being told from two different protagonist points of view, Rob Reiner gives us a wonderful family film about first love. Flipped is a lot less bloody and a great deal sweeter than Martin Scorsese's gangster classic.The prosperous Loski family moves into the neighborhood where the ne'er do well Bakers live. On that day in the late fifties the kids that grow up to be Callan McAuliffe and Madeline Carroll set eyes on each other. Carroll thinks McAuliffe is the one, but such decisions at the age of 7 are sometimes reconsidered. And McAuliffe can't see her for beans, she's just an annoying girl which is not atypical for the second grade.Moving into junior high school is a different matter. With the onset of puberty both these kids are experiencing conflicting emotions. McAuliffe acts like a jerk sometimes, Carroll expects a bit much.The families are different. Anthony Edwards who is McAuliffe's dad is a bit of a fathead and has a thing about his neighbor's lifestyle. Their yard contains a chicken coop and is not in good shape and it's bringing down the values of the other property on the block. As for Aidan Quinn who is Carroll's dad and his family lives as it does in order to support his brother who lives in a sanitarium, an expensive private one for the mentally retarded. Quinn is a wonderful dad, but the Bakers live a whole lot like the Micawbers waiting for something to turn up.The women are wiser than the men, Rebecca DeMornay and Penelope Ann Miller the wives of Edwards and Quinn respectively bond. McAuliffe also has the wisdom of his maternal grandfather John Mahoney to lean on. He's a surrogate grandfather to Carroll as well.Rob Reiner came up with a real winner. The kids act like real kids as opposed to Hollywood kids. The grownups are neither all wise Deities or complete idiots. The women young and old do come out better than the men. I think everyone is going to like this one.Flipped is highly rated for family viewing.

                Loved it. Bryce is so handsome, i could totally empathize with Juli when she would talk about his dazzling eyes. And then when Bryce did some really mean things to her, I could once again totally empathize with Juli and thought he was a complete jerk. The whole story was very relatable to me in general.

                ""All I ever wanted was for Juli Baker to leave me alone.""Flipped is easily the best love story/relationship movie I've seen since (500) Days of Summer. I'm the kind of guy that you couldn't pay to watch a Nicholas Sparks movie, but that doesn't mean that I can't appreciate a good movie about the highs and lows of love. In a year of formulaic, mind-numbing flicks with no imagination or heart like Letters to Juliet, Flipped is a welcome breath of fresh air. It's about 8 or so years in the lives of two kids who meet when when one of them moves into a new neighborhood. Juli (played by Morgan Lily and Madeline Carroll) is instantly smitten by Bryce (Ryan Ketzner and Callan McAuliffe) the second she sees him drive up to his new house. Bryce, being a typical second grade boy, finds her attention embarrassing and unwanted. As they get older, that dynamic between them remains pretty much the same, but we wouldn't have a very interesting movie if that's all there was to it. Eventually Bryce finds himself on the other side of the equation (flipped, get it?), and has to win back the girl he never knew he always wanted.How odd is it that a movie about a couple of kids handles the topic of love in a more mature and genuine way than almost all of the adult-oriented romantic comedies that we're buried under each year? There's no doubt about it that Flipped will make you say ""aww"" on occasion, but there's a lot more to it than just kids being cute. Humor, issues of class, family conflict, and the lost idealism of youth are introduced into the story by Bryce and Juli's respective families, and there are several outright bittersweet or poignant scenes within the story.The movie is shown from the POV's of both main characters, and often the same event will be shown from each of their perspectives. It works really well, as it really helps the viewer to ""get"" both Bryce and Juli. The kids chosen to play the older versions of the two (Carroll and McAuliffe) are both great, the fact that the story is set in 50's or 60's suburbia adds a believable sense of innocence to it all, and there is just a fresh feeling to the movie that I can't really describe with words.I heartily recommend this to anyone who likes a good, well-written movie, regardless of the genre. You can tell that a lot of heart went into making Flipped, and it shows. Great movie.

                'Flipped' is truly a ""real movie"". Probably what most people enjoyed about this movie was that the events that happened in the movie could might as well have been their reality. Many people in this world (if not all) have experienced having a real crush. This movie shows a crush blossoming from both a guy's and a girl's view. It was very interesting to see two viewpoints on this everyday happening. That is what makes this movie so appealing. Viewers get to watch Bryce and Juli's emotions whenever they see the other. Viewers see Bryce and Juli's smiles that they can't help. Viewers get to know who exactly Bryce and Juli are.Anyone and everyone will enjoy this movie or can at least, relate to it. Even adults! This film will surely take you down memory lane and help you remember the feelings you had when you were first in love. I've never experienced being in love before, but this film makes it seem wonderful. I absolutely loved this film.Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe were great in this film! Even if they're very young, they did wonderful jobs in performing here. In each of their scenes, you could sense the emotions that they were feeling and wanted to convey to the viewers. The characters themselves were also very interesting. Particularly Ms. Juli Baker. It was nice to see such a free-spirited teenager, who was very opinionated and didn't let anything stand in her way. The chemistry that both actors had were average. I thought that they showed their most potential when acting by themselves, in their own surroundings.I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that Rob Reiner, the director of this film, was the same person who directed 'When Harry Met Sally' and 'Sleepless in Seattle'. So far, all romantic-comedies that Rob Reiner has directed has not disappointed me. I can't wait for more of his works! All his rom-coms are excellent additions to the romance movie genre.This was an amazing teenage romantic comedy. Surely one of my favorites, right up there with 'When Harry Met Sally'. Do not miss this film. It's baffling to see that this film isn't as popular as it's supposed to be.Viewed on: April 5, 2011 ; December 16, 2011

                Juli just had to take one look at Bryce's blue eyes, and she knew it was true love. Bryce just had to take one notice of Juli's manic desperation, and he knew it was going to be a friendship of torment. I just had to take one look at the film's artfully designed poster, and I knew ""Flipped"" was a film to be savoured.A beautifully told film of first love, we flip from Juli's point of view to Bryce's point of view, very effectively giving us the true nature of their friendship, love and respect they have for each other. Except in the case of middle-school graders, that love and respect can frequently look like embarrassment, mistrust, and shame. All of those emotions are told with intelligence, subtlety and humour.""Flipped"" has all of the comedy, naiveté and bewilderment of first love. It takes the romantic comedy farther by actually giving us characters with real depth. There is more going on than just Juli and Bryce figuring out their love for each other, and every aspect of this film is well written, touching and relevant.""Flipped"" is a cute film for everybody who fondly remembers that fiercely independent girl or the guy with piercing blue eyes that lived across the street.

                ""Flipped"" is superbly directed by Rob Reiner and in my book, one of his best movies. It's a wonderfully told coming-of-age story, which I could relate to in many ways. The main two characters, Juli and Bryce, are very likable. Their parents, played by Penelope Ann Miller and Aidan Quinn, Rebecca de Mornay and Anthony Edwards, respectively, are believable in their roles, which they play excellently. I liked the fact that the story is told from two points of views, Bryce first and then Juli. If you want to see a really feel-good movie, instead of watching some dumb comedy or shoot 'em up flick, go see FLIPPED! You will not regret it.

                I just discovered this gem on Netflix and was impressed, moved and entertained. Its a romantic film about puppy love, so it may not be for everyone (even teens) but I found the leads to be charming and charismatic. The plot device is nothing new, but the charm and early 60's setting make it fresh in many ways. A wonderful cast led by the young leads (now grown!), the late John Mahoney and Aidan Quinn help make this film watchable and enjoyable. A wholesome movie with wonderful moments.

The character development was good, not like many movies which focus on only the main characters.

                Back in 1973, an episode of ""All in the Family"" told the same story from three different perspectives, one of which was from the point of view of Mike ""Meathead"" Stivic, played by Rob Reiner. Watching his latest directorial effort, I wondered if the ""he said / she said"" gimmick of that episode (""Everybody Tells the Truth"") was what attracted Reiner to ""Flipped,"" the young-adult novel by Wendelin Van Draanen, which employs the same multi-POV technique that Lawrence Durrell perfected with his ""Alexandria Quartet"" in the late 1950s. The film version of ""Flipped"" shows Reiner at the top of his form, a worthy addition to an ouevre that includes such classics as ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" ""Misery,"" ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Stand By Me,"" the 1986 period piece that ""Flipped"" most recalls, with its younger characters and coming-of-age theme. At the heart of ""Flipped"" is Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll), a smart, pretty and thoughtful girl who you just can't help losing your heart to. Juli herself flips for Bryce Loski, who is at first repelled by Juli and then slowly starts to see her for the lovely person she is. The cast is augmented by such pros as John Mahoney (Frasier's dad on ""Cheers""), Anthony Edwards, Aidan Quinn and Rebecca De Mornay and Penelope Ann Miller. The film offers up various slices of life from the late '50s and early '60s that makes for a nostalgic, romantic and very moving film. Special kudos to the filmmakers for finding a girl to play young Juli (Morgan Lily) who looks chillingly like Madeline Carroll; I would have bet anything the two were sisters. For those who are bored by the dumb-dumb summer comedies of 2010 (""The Other Guys,"" ""Dinner for Schmucks"") and the special-effects hijinks of ""Inception,"" this is a tender and emotionally satisfying journey that will stay with you for years.

                I really, really liked this film and now wonder why it didn't make more impact when it debuted. Perhaps it was just one of those films that slipped between the cracks because ""Flipped"" is a wonderful coming of age film--and is among director Rob Reiner's best.The film is set mostly in the early 1960s. A young boy, Bryce, moves to a new neighborhood and almost instantly the girl across the street, Juli, begins mooning over him and acting like she's infatuated with him. But he's 7--and hating girls and mushy stuff is normal and he resists her charms. But she persists as the years pass--and she's convinced herself that Bryce is her dream boy. But, as the years pass, Bryce is just as convinced that Juli is a pest. However, eventually, Bryce's attitude starts to change...too bad Juli's is as well!This is a remarkable film in so many ways. The direction is wonderful--perfectly paced and very sweet. The writing is also exceptionally sweet and enchanting. It also helped that there were some wonderful supporting actors to assist in telling the story-- some characters you really liked and cared about and a couple who were complete jerks. John Mahoney was particularly good, but the entire cast was wonderful in this movie. Overall, the elements all work together to tell a sweet story that anyone could love. My only quibble, and it's a very minor one, is about the music. Too many older films are saturated with oldies music. While a bit is nice, with some it sounds more like a best of record album...and at times I would have preferred ""Flipped"" to have been a bit quieter. Not a major complaint by any means and I still give this film a well deserved 9.

                Okay, let's dispense immediately with the idea that this film is geared toward teenagers and all of their sap that they go through. I assure you ""mature adults"" out there that this film will delight you also, unless you are a completely hopelessly lost Scrooge. This film should make sense to all ages. Everyone should identify with it. I don't care what kind of a snob, low-life, big wig, or puritan you are, you should enjoy this film. It's never too sappy when it deals with matters of the heart, nor is it too blunt and insensitive.The film is told almost entirely in a voice over of one of the two main characters. It's told in a brilliant he-said she-said style where the same scene is often told twice from the two opposite points of view (Juli's and Bryce's). So we see the opening scene twice. The first time as explained by Bryce, and the second time explained by Juli. This sort of formula is used many a time in the unfolding battle of the sexes. Of course this doesn't happen in every scene—that would get boring. Director Reiner gives us the proper dosage of everything in this film. The proper amount of comedy, romance, and the proper amount of sadness. Never is it sappy or indulgent or even presumptuous. It's a perfect film for what it's worth. The screenplay is absolutely the work of a fine craftsman—or craftsmen Andrew Scheinman and director Reiner. I don't know how long it took to write or how much blood went into it, but this film is the result of excellent work in every department. The two child stars are perfect in their roles (although Bryce could have done better), but the strength of the cast are in supporting actors. The cast is full of great actors, particularly Anthony Edwards as Bryce's arrogant, critical, smart-Aleck father, and the ever-welcome Aidan Quinn as Juli's loving, down-to-earth, tree painting father.I wasn't completely convinced of the excellence of the film until a beautiful scene in which Mr. Baker (Quinn) and Juli go to visit Mr. Baker's mentally retarded brother Daniel, who is so happy with the world and everything in it. But this scene can't be expressed in words, you have to see it. For what it's worth, Flipped is somewhat of a deep film, full of parallels to the real world. All of the characters have the proper amount of development, even the big sycamore tree that Juli likes to sit in and watch the sunrise. Her exploits while up in that tree are so poetic and beautiful when matched up with the pictures on screen. It's a beautiful and insightful scene into the thoughts and feelings of people in general, not just a teenage girl.In this day when films are almost all big-budget action movies with loud explosions, Flipped has explosions of its own kind. It has explosions of heart and feeling and character, all at the appropriate times. I did not find any ax to grind here. Other than the characters, plot, and screenplay, it's also a technically beautiful film. The camera captures everything so clearly with the proper color timing and excellently framed shots. After the mid-way point of the film, being surrounded by excellence, one starts to look for any reason to criticize the film. I found none. Every nuance of the film is done so genteelly and honestly, who can have a problem with it? This film achieves what movies are meant to achieve. They are meant to reach into are minds and draw us in, to entertain and to move us with fright, emotion, tears, laughs, whatever may be the subject. They are meant to create a world around us, whether in space, in the Wild West, in the future, in Bible times, or in the case of Flipped in 1960s suburbia. This film does exactly what it is meant to do. To touch and make us laugh and to remember. That's what it does. It makes us remember what happened or is happening to us. No one can give this a bad review. I don't see how anyone can pick a fight with the film. But I'm blabbing about nothing.In short, Flipped is by far the best film I've seen this year. I do hope the Academy doesn't overlook this like they do so many other ""family"" films. It should at least get a few nominations, if not a win. We'll see what happens. It's only July.www.colewebbharter.com

                This is a coming of age film set initially and briefly in the late 1950s and mostly in the early 1960s. The boy, Bryce, is chased by his neighbor girl, Juli. And is he chased! Juli is immediately smitten or ""flipped"" by Bryce's eyes and the story unfolds.What is unusual about the story telling is that each major event is played back twice - once through the eyes and voice of Bryce and once through the eyes and voice of Juli. It's the same scene, but you wouldn't know that from their differing viewpoints.Juli is the adventurous and interesting one. Bryce just wants to fit in at their Junior High School. Juli slowly begins to unlike Bryce and Bryce slowly begins to appreciate Juli. Will they ever meet at the same emotional place at the same time? That is the drama and story.The art direction and era are right on. It is the Eisenhower and Kennedy years in look, and even in feel. The wives are subordinate to the husbands. The children are mostly respectful to their parents. And the teachers teach and the students learn. But, you can see the seeds being laid for the rebellious war babies of the late 1960s.Rob Reiner is a talented director for romances - ""When Harry Met Sally."" And he is a talented director for handling young actors - ""Stand By Me."" He combines these talents to help us understand the better part of the human condition; that is, love, respect, sacrifice, forgiveness, and honor. And we have fun and laugh along the way. This is like the TV program, ""Wonder Years"" - but heightened and deepened.-Bob, a Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award Jury Member

                Flipped is a one in a million film - I mean, REALLY one in a million. It's refreshing and lovely, dramatic and hilarious. It does what few films do in our time (or rather what they don't do): Flipped does not sacrifice its integrity for raunchy, gratuitous content. It's real. The emotions are real. The characters are real. And while it certainly isn't G-rated fluff (and do not be fooled - this is not a film for young children), the movie is definitely gentle and innocent in many ways. On the downside, without giving anything away, the ending of the film could have been better patched together, but overall the movie is a cinematic gem like no other. Go see Flipped!

                Juli flipped over Bryce. Bryce's dad flips out. Mom and sister wear their hair in a flip.Charming tale told in a ""he said she said"" often voice-over manner. Interesting enough and short enough so the style doesn't detract. Don't let the print ads mislead you. Bryce never climbs the tree.Excellent performances from the entire cast. Outstanding use of period music. Great collection of shinning '57 Chevy's.Courage, family values, character and nothing explodes. People of every age are treated with respect. What a refreshing movie. Archie Bunker was wrong, Rob Reiner got it right again. He's no meat-head.

                Beautifully told with all the ingredients for a good family movie. The story is told from two different views, the view from the boy and from the girl. A boy who is annoyed by all the attention he gets from the girl across the street. The girl from across the street who has a super crush on the boy tells her part of the story. The boy's father is a man filled with hatred who dispenses politically incorrect lines throughout the movie. The grandfather, the great John Mohoney, is the wise person who tells the boy to really see the girl for what she is, a very special girl. I don't want to give anything away of this jewel of a movie. I enjoyed this movie very much and totally recommend it.

                It's a FANTASTIC one! I have completely fallen in love with it. The puppy love between Julianna and Bryce is so sweet and comedic.What l enjoy Most about the movie is definitely the picturesque countryside it depicts.Yeah,Countryside,along with little Juli and her ""most beautiful"" sycamore tree.I'm always touched by the bucolic and quaint scene where Juli's sitting in her sycamore tree,feeling the gentle breeze blush her cheek and enjoying the majestic and spectacular sunset ,dying the whole sky red.How amazing!It's just the kind of country life l am always yearning for.
Also,I bought this impressive American novel last year,which is as great as the movie.

                A very enjoyable movie, effectively embracing the coming of age sensitivities which come to us all. Although it is clear there are many nuances of other characters which never get dealt with, it's meant to be that way. This is about the kids, the effect they have on one another, their ability and inability to express their feelings, and what can happen when we finally face our fears about the other sex and dare to take a step toward resolving them. The only issue I have is that the film simply has too many anachronisms -- songs not of the period and figures of speech clearly from the present and not the fifties and sixties, but hey, I'm too darn picky about that stuff. Reiner has done it again, offering us a film in the style and tone of Capra. He has crafted a film of sensitivity and grace, and taught us something about life that most of us lose upon becoming adults. Madeline Carroll is simply wonderful as the independent teen taking life head on, and is a true pleasure to watch. She absolutely carries this film.

                Of all the movies I've seen lately, Flipped was amongst the most refreshing. If it had been done by a different director and had different screenwriters, it might be a terrible cliché. Story of first love, known each other since kids, bla bla bla, we've all heard it before.But this movie, it was so pure and so realistic, which is what I love about it most. It wasn't over the top romantic, but it was enough to tug my heartstrings and made me go ""awwww"" instead of going ""ewwww"".The characters felt like real people, and the issues faced in the story felt so real and believable, it made me believe in the basic form of love once more, and that it still existed in real life (even though I know it's just in the movies, but still).Anyway, if you're looking for a story that is refreshing yet vintage, and wanting to have a lovey-dovey grin plastered on your face, then this is the movie to watch.

                Flipped is a sweet, charming, moving, lovely, well-acted coming-of-age romantic drama comedy film.While the plot offers nothing new in particular (as with mostly all rom- com films)...the 'girl meets boy' mixed with 'the not-your-typical girl next door' story, but the storytelling is slightly different. Adapted from the book with the same name by Wendelin Van Draanen, the film is presented in a rather unique 'he-said she-said' style, through the eyes and thoughts of the male lead, Bryce and then again through the eyes and thoughts of female lead, Juli, alternately presenting their views and perspectives on a shared set of events. Nearly every single event that happened in the film is told at least twice, although it seems repetitive, but surprisingly, it never feels boring or annoying. It's actually fascinating and insightful to be able to see into the thoughts and feelings of people in general. Things are not really what it seems and there's always more than meets the eye. As the film progresses, you are so emotionally invested in the characters that you actually begin to eagerly anticipate what the other side of the story might be, how the other person feels the way he/she does. The film also gives a feeling of nostalgia, even for those who never lived in the era (the story is set in 50's or 60's suburban area) or experienced the same events as the two leads. It feels authentic and relatable nonetheless. Juli might appear as an ordinary girl, but she's a sweet, kind, beautiful, daring girl at heart once you get to know her.The two lead stars are perfect in their respective roles. Most of the characters in the film have sufficient character development for the audience to understand them. Flipped is a period young love story, told in a simple and heartfelt manner. A rare cinematic gem.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/shorter-movie-review-flipped.html Rating: 8/10""A painting is more than the sum of its parts. A cow by itself is just a cow.

                Flipped is a coming of age film directed by the coming of age master director Rob Reiner. Reiner directed the tear-jerker Stand By Me and is now back to bring Wendelin Van Draanen's novel of the same name to life. What a treat! Flipped and Stand By Me both make me wish my childhood was full of more adventure and fun rather than just me sitting on the computer writing review after review aspiring to be a critic. I get tears in my eyes to both films because I become so attached to the characters and they're living the life I can only dream to have. With the exception of unfaithful parents when it comes to Stand By Me.What came to mind halfway through the film was why couldn't the movie Speak have been this good? This film proves more than 80% can be done by narration from TWO characters different perspective and it can be done well. Why not do the same for Speak? Most of the dialog in this film is internal and not directly word of mouth and it works. Why not treat Speak the same way? Were they afraid they would mess it up? It begs an explanation to why Laurie Halse Anderson's novel's potential on film was unfaithful to it's film companion.Never reading the book, I do know that it was set in the nineties and the two thousands while this film's setting is in the late fifties and early sixties. It's not that big of a deal with the drastic setting change, but maybe I would've been more upset if I was a huge fan of the book to find out the film was set four years in the past.The movie about Bryce Loski (McAuliffe), a kid who moves into the neighborhood at a young age to immediately become eye candy to his new neighbor Juli Baker (Carroll). Bryce is resistant, while Juli is persistent. She is positive Bryce will give her her first kiss and believes Bryce is just a little shy, when really he wants nothing to do with her. Juli continues up until present day middle school to give Bryce the chance to admit his ""feelings"" for her but doesn't.Juli lives across the street from Bryce and her yard is an eyesore. It's paid for by the landlord since most of the money Juli and her family makes is given to Juli's father's mentally challenged brother. Bryce's family, his dad mostly, is annoyed by Juli and her family's crappy yard and continue to bad mouth and make assumptions about the Baker family when they really have no idea what it's like over there.The film is narrated by both leads more often than not. Usually we'll get five minutes or so of Bryce narrating his side of the story, while Juli narrates her's. It's almost an anthology because we see what goes on from Bryce's standpoint while hearing his thoughts at the moment and then we see what happened prior or after the events of Bryce's because we then go to Juli. It's confusing. But it works all the time.At the beginning of the film I thought the narrations were only used for the audience to get affiliated with the lives of the characters and what happened before we got here. We spend ninety minutes or longer with movie characters and some films don't even give you the damn courtesy to provide us with any kind of background information. We are supposed to just be thrown into a film with characters we sometimes don't even find out the last names to.The one minor problem I have with the film is the end. It leaves off on the wrong note. The film is only ninety minutes when it could and should be longer. The place they ended was fine, but the scenes on the DVD cover and poster never occur in the film. What a letdown.Flipped is 2010's underrated masterpiece and it definitely showcases a worthy coming of age film. It's smooth style of directing, great music, calm feeling even at it's most stressful, and strong leads are more than I could've asked for. Rob Reiner is something else. A true talent in the movie business. Especially when making a movie as heartfelt as this one.Starring: Callan McAuliffe, Madeline Carroll, Rebecca De Mornay, Anthony Edwards, John Mahoney, Penelope Ann Miller, Aidan Quinn, and Kevin Weisman. Directed by: Rob Reiner.

                With a technique borrowed from Casino of the story being told from two different protagonist points of view, Rob Reiner gives us a wonderful family film about first love. Flipped is a lot less bloody and a great deal sweeter than Martin Scorsese's gangster classic.The prosperous Loski family moves into the neighborhood where the ne'er do well Bakers live. On that day in the late fifties the kids that grow up to be Callan McAuliffe and Madeline Carroll set eyes on each other. Carroll thinks McAuliffe is the one, but such decisions at the age of 7 are sometimes reconsidered. And McAuliffe can't see her for beans, she's just an annoying girl which is not atypical for the second grade.Moving into junior high school is a different matter. With the onset of puberty both these kids are experiencing conflicting emotions. McAuliffe acts like a jerk sometimes, Carroll expects a bit much.The families are different. Anthony Edwards who is McAuliffe's dad is a bit of a fathead and has a thing about his neighbor's lifestyle. Their yard contains a chicken coop and is not in good shape and it's bringing down the values of the other property on the block. As for Aidan Quinn who is Carroll's dad and his family lives as it does in order to support his brother who lives in a sanitarium, an expensive private one for the mentally retarded. Quinn is a wonderful dad, but the Bakers live a whole lot like the Micawbers waiting for something to turn up.The women are wiser than the men, Rebecca DeMornay and Penelope Ann Miller the wives of Edwards and Quinn respectively bond. McAuliffe also has the wisdom of his maternal grandfather John Mahoney to lean on. He's a surrogate grandfather to Carroll as well.Rob Reiner came up with a real winner. The kids act like real kids as opposed to Hollywood kids. The grownups are neither all wise Deities or complete idiots. The women young and old do come out better than the men. I think everyone is going to like this one.Flipped is highly rated for family viewing.

                ""All I ever wanted was for Juli Baker to leave me alone.""Flipped is easily the best love story/relationship movie I've seen since (500) Days of Summer. I'm the kind of guy that you couldn't pay to watch a Nicholas Sparks movie, but that doesn't mean that I can't appreciate a good movie about the highs and lows of love. In a year of formulaic, mind-numbing flicks with no imagination or heart like Letters to Juliet, Flipped is a welcome breath of fresh air. It's about 8 or so years in the lives of two kids who meet when when one of them moves into a new neighborhood. Juli (played by Morgan Lily and Madeline Carroll) is instantly smitten by Bryce (Ryan Ketzner and Callan McAuliffe) the second she sees him drive up to his new house. Bryce, being a typical second grade boy, finds her attention embarrassing and unwanted. As they get older, that dynamic between them remains pretty much the same, but we wouldn't have a very interesting movie if that's all there was to it. Eventually Bryce finds himself on the other side of the equation (flipped, get it?), and has to win back the girl he never knew he always wanted.How odd is it that a movie about a couple of kids handles the topic of love in a more mature and genuine way than almost all of the adult-oriented romantic comedies that we're buried under each year? There's no doubt about it that Flipped will make you say ""aww"" on occasion, but there's a lot more to it than just kids being cute. Humor, issues of class, family conflict, and the lost idealism of youth are introduced into the story by Bryce and Juli's respective families, and there are several outright bittersweet or poignant scenes within the story.The movie is shown from the POV's of both main characters, and often the same event will be shown from each of their perspectives. It works really well, as it really helps the viewer to ""get"" both Bryce and Juli. The kids chosen to play the older versions of the two (Carroll and McAuliffe) are both great, the fact that the story is set in 50's or 60's suburbia adds a believable sense of innocence to it all, and there is just a fresh feeling to the movie that I can't really describe with words.I heartily recommend this to anyone who likes a good, well-written movie, regardless of the genre. You can tell that a lot of heart went into making Flipped, and it shows. Great movie.

                'Flipped' is truly a ""real movie"". Probably what most people enjoyed about this movie was that the events that happened in the movie could might as well have been their reality. Many people in this world (if not all) have experienced having a real crush. This movie shows a crush blossoming from both a guy's and a girl's view. It was very interesting to see two viewpoints on this everyday happening. That is what makes this movie so appealing. Viewers get to watch Bryce and Juli's emotions whenever they see the other. Viewers see Bryce and Juli's smiles that they can't help. Viewers get to know who exactly Bryce and Juli are.Anyone and everyone will enjoy this movie or can at least, relate to it. Even adults! This film will surely take you down memory lane and help you remember the feelings you had when you were first in love. I've never experienced being in love before, but this film makes it seem wonderful. I absolutely loved this film.Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe were great in this film! Even if they're very young, they did wonderful jobs in performing here. In each of their scenes, you could sense the emotions that they were feeling and wanted to convey to the viewers. The characters themselves were also very interesting. Particularly Ms. Juli Baker. It was nice to see such a free-spirited teenager, who was very opinionated and didn't let anything stand in her way. The chemistry that both actors had were average. I thought that they showed their most potential when acting by themselves, in their own surroundings.I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that Rob Reiner, the director of this film, was the same person who directed 'When Harry Met Sally' and 'Sleepless in Seattle'. So far, all romantic-comedies that Rob Reiner has directed has not disappointed me. I can't wait for more of his works! All his rom-coms are excellent additions to the romance movie genre.This was an amazing teenage romantic comedy. Surely one of my favorites, right up there with 'When Harry Met Sally'. Do not miss this film. It's baffling to see that this film isn't as popular as it's supposed to be.Viewed on: April 5, 2011 ; December 16, 2011

                Juli just had to take one look at Bryce's blue eyes, and she knew it was true love. Bryce just had to take one notice of Juli's manic desperation, and he knew it was going to be a friendship of torment. I just had to take one look at the film's artfully designed poster, and I knew ""Flipped"" was a film to be savoured.A beautifully told film of first love, we flip from Juli's point of view to Bryce's point of view, very effectively giving us the true nature of their friendship, love and respect they have for each other. Except in the case of middle-school graders, that love and respect can frequently look like embarrassment, mistrust, and shame. All of those emotions are told with intelligence, subtlety and humour.""Flipped"" has all of the comedy, naiveté and bewilderment of first love. It takes the romantic comedy farther by actually giving us characters with real depth. There is more going on than just Juli and Bryce figuring out their love for each other, and every aspect of this film is well written, touching and relevant.""Flipped"" is a cute film for everybody who fondly remembers that fiercely independent girl or the guy with piercing blue eyes that lived across the street.

","
                ""Flipped"" is superbly directed by Rob Reiner and in my book, one of his best movies. It's a wonderfully told coming-of-age story, which I could relate to in many ways. The main two characters, Juli and Bryce, are very likable. Their parents, played by Penelope Ann Miller and Aidan Quinn, Rebecca de Mornay and Anthony Edwards, respectively, are believable in their roles, which they play excellently. I liked the fact that the story is told from two points of views, Bryce first and then Juli. If you want to see a really feel-good movie, instead of watching some dumb comedy or shoot 'em up flick, go see FLIPPED! You will not regret it.

                I just discovered this gem on Netflix and was impressed, moved and entertained. Its a romantic film about puppy love, so it may not be for everyone (even teens) but I found the leads to be charming and charismatic. The plot device is nothing new, but the charm and early 60's setting make it fresh in many ways. A wonderful cast led by the young leads (now grown!), the late John Mahoney and Aidan Quinn help make this film watchable and enjoyable. A wholesome movie with wonderful moments.

                The first few minutes sent me back a decade reminding how much we avoided girls or getting our names attached to one..I really liked how the story showed a basic fact (mostly at least) :""The one you love doesn't love you back, and you don't love the one that loves you!""Though the main story is not that all can relate to, the background or the base of the story was really nice. The character development was good, not like many movies which focus on only the main characters. Though the story was a little predictable, the movie is enjoyable and among a few to which we can relate to.This movie is definitely worth a watch.And it deserves an 8 out of 10.

","
                Back in 1973, an episode of ""All in the Family"" told the same story from three different perspectives, one of which was from the point of view of Mike ""Meathead"" Stivic, played by Rob Reiner. Watching his latest directorial effort, I wondered if the ""he said / she said"" gimmick of that episode (""Everybody Tells the Truth"") was what attracted Reiner to ""Flipped,"" the young-adult novel by Wendelin Van Draanen, which employs the same multi-POV technique that Lawrence Durrell perfected with his ""Alexandria Quartet"" in the late 1950s. The film version of ""Flipped"" shows Reiner at the top of his form, a worthy addition to an ouevre that includes such classics as ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" ""Misery,"" ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Stand By Me,"" the 1986 period piece that ""Flipped"" most recalls, with its younger characters and coming-of-age theme. At the heart of ""Flipped"" is Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll), a smart, pretty and thoughtful girl who you just can't help losing your heart to. Juli herself flips for Bryce Loski, who is at first repelled by Juli and then slowly starts to see her for the lovely person she is. The cast is augmented by such pros as John Mahoney (Frasier's dad on ""Cheers""), Anthony Edwards, Aidan Quinn and Rebecca De Mornay and Penelope Ann Miller. The film offers up various slices of life from the late '50s and early '60s that makes for a nostalgic, romantic and very moving film. Special kudos to the filmmakers for finding a girl to play young Juli (Morgan Lily) who looks chillingly like Madeline Carroll; I would have bet anything the two were sisters. For those who are bored by the dumb-dumb summer comedies of 2010 (""The Other Guys,"" ""Dinner for Schmucks"") and the special-effects hijinks of ""Inception,"" this is a tender and emotionally satisfying journey that will stay with you for years.

                I really, really liked this film and now wonder why it didn't make more impact when it debuted. Perhaps it was just one of those films that slipped between the cracks because ""Flipped"" is a wonderful coming of age film--and is among director Rob Reiner's best.The film is set mostly in the early 1960s. A young boy, Bryce, moves to a new neighborhood and almost instantly the girl across the street, Juli, begins mooning over him and acting like she's infatuated with him. But he's 7--and hating girls and mushy stuff is normal and he resists her charms. But she persists as the years pass--and she's convinced herself that Bryce is her dream boy. But, as the years pass, Bryce is just as convinced that Juli is a pest. However, eventually, Bryce's attitude starts to change...too bad Juli's is as well!This is a remarkable film in so many ways. The direction is wonderful--perfectly paced and very sweet. The writing is also exceptionally sweet and enchanting. It also helped that there were some wonderful supporting actors to assist in telling the story-- some characters you really liked and cared about and a couple who were complete jerks. John Mahoney was particularly good, but the entire cast was wonderful in this movie. Overall, the elements all work together to tell a sweet story that anyone could love. My only quibble, and it's a very minor one, is about the music. Too many older films are saturated with oldies music. While a bit is nice, with some it sounds more like a best of record album...and at times I would have preferred ""Flipped"" to have been a bit quieter. Not a major complaint by any means and I still give this film a well deserved 9.

                Okay, let's dispense immediately with the idea that this film is geared toward teenagers and all of their sap that they go through. I assure you ""mature adults"" out there that this film will delight you also, unless you are a completely hopelessly lost Scrooge. This film should make sense to all ages. Everyone should identify with it. I don't care what kind of a snob, low-life, big wig, or puritan you are, you should enjoy this film. It's never too sappy when it deals with matters of the heart, nor is it too blunt and insensitive.The film is told almost entirely in a voice over of one of the two main characters. It's told in a brilliant he-said she-said style where the same scene is often told twice from the two opposite points of view (Juli's and Bryce's). So we see the opening scene twice. The first time as explained by Bryce, and the second time explained by Juli. This sort of formula is used many a time in the unfolding battle of the sexes. Of course this doesn't happen in every scene—that would get boring. Director Reiner gives us the proper dosage of everything in this film. The proper amount of comedy, romance, and the proper amount of sadness. Never is it sappy or indulgent or even presumptuous. It's a perfect film for what it's worth. The screenplay is absolutely the work of a fine craftsman—or craftsmen Andrew Scheinman and director Reiner. I don't know how long it took to write or how much blood went into it, but this film is the result of excellent work in every department. The two child stars are perfect in their roles (although Bryce could have done better), but the strength of the cast are in supporting actors. The cast is full of great actors, particularly Anthony Edwards as Bryce's arrogant, critical, smart-Aleck father, and the ever-welcome Aidan Quinn as Juli's loving, down-to-earth, tree painting father.I wasn't completely convinced of the excellence of the film until a beautiful scene in which Mr. Baker (Quinn) and Juli go to visit Mr. Baker's mentally retarded brother Daniel, who is so happy with the world and everything in it. But this scene can't be expressed in words, you have to see it. For what it's worth, Flipped is somewhat of a deep film, full of parallels to the real world. All of the characters have the proper amount of development, even the big sycamore tree that Juli likes to sit in and watch the sunrise. Her exploits while up in that tree are so poetic and beautiful when matched up with the pictures on screen. It's a beautiful and insightful scene into the thoughts and feelings of people in general, not just a teenage girl.In this day when films are almost all big-budget action movies with loud explosions, Flipped has explosions of its own kind. It has explosions of heart and feeling and character, all at the appropriate times. I did not find any ax to grind here. Other than the characters, plot, and screenplay, it's also a technically beautiful film. The camera captures everything so clearly with the proper color timing and excellently framed shots. After the mid-way point of the film, being surrounded by excellence, one starts to look for any reason to criticize the film. I found none. Every nuance of the film is done so genteelly and honestly, who can have a problem with it? This film achieves what movies are meant to achieve. They are meant to reach into are minds and draw us in, to entertain and to move us with fright, emotion, tears, laughs, whatever may be the subject. They are meant to create a world around us, whether in space, in the Wild West, in the future, in Bible times, or in the case of Flipped in 1960s suburbia. This film does exactly what it is meant to do. To touch and make us laugh and to remember. That's what it does. It makes us remember what happened or is happening to us. No one can give this a bad review. I don't see how anyone can pick a fight with the film. But I'm blabbing about nothing.In short, Flipped is by far the best film I've seen this year. I do hope the Academy doesn't overlook this like they do so many other ""family"" films. It should at least get a few nominations, if not a win. We'll see what happens. It's only July.www.colewebbharter.com

                This is a coming of age film set initially and briefly in the late 1950s and mostly in the early 1960s. The boy, Bryce, is chased by his neighbor girl, Juli. And is he chased! Juli is immediately smitten or ""flipped"" by Bryce's eyes and the story unfolds.What is unusual about the story telling is that each major event is played back twice - once through the eyes and voice of Bryce and once through the eyes and voice of Juli. It's the same scene, but you wouldn't know that from their differing viewpoints.Juli is the adventurous and interesting one. Bryce just wants to fit in at their Junior High School. Juli slowly begins to unlike Bryce and Bryce slowly begins to appreciate Juli. Will they ever meet at the same emotional place at the same time? That is the drama and story.The art direction and era are right on. It is the Eisenhower and Kennedy years in look, and even in feel. The wives are subordinate to the husbands. The children are mostly respectful to their parents. And the teachers teach and the students learn. But, you can see the seeds being laid for the rebellious war babies of the late 1960s.Rob Reiner is a talented director for romances - ""When Harry Met Sally."" And he is a talented director for handling young actors - ""Stand By Me."" He combines these talents to help us understand the better part of the human condition; that is, love, respect, sacrifice, forgiveness, and honor. And we have fun and laugh along the way. This is like the TV program, ""Wonder Years"" - but heightened and deepened.-Bob, a Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award Jury Member

                Flipped is a one in a million film - I mean, REALLY one in a million. It's refreshing and lovely, dramatic and hilarious. It does what few films do in our time (or rather what they don't do): Flipped does not sacrifice its integrity for raunchy, gratuitous content. It's real. The emotions are real. The characters are real. And while it certainly isn't G-rated fluff (and do not be fooled - this is not a film for young children), the movie is definitely gentle and innocent in many ways. On the downside, without giving anything away, the ending of the film could have been better patched together, but overall the movie is a cinematic gem like no other. Go see Flipped!

Interesting enough and short enough so the style doesn't detract. Don't let the print ads mislead you. Bryce never climbs the tree.Excellent performances from the entire cast. Outstanding use of period music. Great collection of shinning '57 Chevy's.Courage, family values, character and nothing explodes. People of every age are treated with respect. What a refreshing movie. Archie Bunker was wrong, Rob Reiner got it right again. He's no meat-head.

                Beautifully told with all the ingredients for a good family movie. The story is told from two different views, the view from the boy and from the girl. A boy who is annoyed by all the attention he gets from the girl across the street. The girl from across the street who has a super crush on the boy tells her part of the story. The boy's father is a man filled with hatred who dispenses politically incorrect lines throughout the movie. The grandfather, the great John Mohoney, is the wise person who tells the boy to really see the girl for what she is, a very special girl. I don't want to give anything away of this jewel of a movie. I enjoyed this movie very much and totally recommend it.

                It's a FANTASTIC one! I have completely fallen in love with it. The puppy love between Julianna and Bryce is so sweet and comedic.What l enjoy Most about the movie is definitely the picturesque countryside it depicts.Yeah,Countryside,along with little Juli and her ""most beautiful"" sycamore tree.I'm always touched by the bucolic and quaint scene where Juli's sitting in her sycamore tree,feeling the gentle breeze blush her cheek and enjoying the majestic and spectacular sunset ,dying the whole sky red.How amazing!It's just the kind of country life l am always yearning for.
Also,I bought this impressive American novel last year,which is as great as the movie.

                A very enjoyable movie, effectively embracing the coming of age sensitivities which come to us all. Although it is clear there are many nuances of other characters which never get dealt with, it's meant to be that way. This is about the kids, the effect they have on one another, their ability and inability to express their feelings, and what can happen when we finally face our fears about the other sex and dare to take a step toward resolving them. The only issue I have is that the film simply has too many anachronisms -- songs not of the period and figures of speech clearly from the present and not the fifties and sixties, but hey, I'm too darn picky about that stuff. Reiner has done it again, offering us a film in the style and tone of Capra. He has crafted a film of sensitivity and grace, and taught us something about life that most of us lose upon becoming adults. Madeline Carroll is simply wonderful as the independent teen taking life head on, and is a true pleasure to watch. She absolutely carries this film.

                Of all the movies I've seen lately, Flipped was amongst the most refreshing. If it had been done by a different director and had different screenwriters, it might be a terrible cliché. Story of first love, known each other since kids, bla bla bla, we've all heard it before.But this movie, it was so pure and so realistic, which is what I love about it most. It wasn't over the top romantic, but it was enough to tug my heartstrings and made me go ""awwww"" instead of going ""ewwww"".The characters felt like real people, and the issues faced in the story felt so real and believable, it made me believe in the basic form of love once more, and that it still existed in real life (even though I know it's just in the movies, but still).Anyway, if you're looking for a story that is refreshing yet vintage, and wanting to have a lovey-dovey grin plastered on your face, then this is the movie to watch.

                Flipped is a sweet, charming, moving, lovely, well-acted coming-of-age romantic drama comedy film.While the plot offers nothing new in particular (as with mostly all rom- com films)...the 'girl meets boy' mixed with 'the not-your-typical girl next door' story, but the storytelling is slightly different. Adapted from the book with the same name by Wendelin Van Draanen, the film is presented in a rather unique 'he-said she-said' style, through the eyes and thoughts of the male lead, Bryce and then again through the eyes and thoughts of female lead, Juli, alternately presenting their views and perspectives on a shared set of events. Nearly every single event that happened in the film is told at least twice, although it seems repetitive, but surprisingly, it never feels boring or annoying. It's actually fascinating and insightful to be able to see into the thoughts and feelings of people in general. Things are not really what it seems and there's always more than meets the eye. As the film progresses, you are so emotionally invested in the characters that you actually begin to eagerly anticipate what the other side of the story might be, how the other person feels the way he/she does. The film also gives a feeling of nostalgia, even for those who never lived in the era (the story is set in 50's or 60's suburban area) or experienced the same events as the two leads. It feels authentic and relatable nonetheless. Juli might appear as an ordinary girl, but she's a sweet, kind, beautiful, daring girl at heart once you get to know her.The two lead stars are perfect in their respective roles. Most of the characters in the film have sufficient character development for the audience to understand them. Flipped is a period young love story, told in a simple and heartfelt manner. A rare cinematic gem.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/shorter-movie-review-flipped.html Rating: 8/10""A painting is more than the sum of its parts. A cow by itself is just a cow.

                Flipped is a coming of age film directed by the coming of age master director Rob Reiner. Reiner directed the tear-jerker Stand By Me and is now back to bring Wendelin Van Draanen's novel of the same name to life. What a treat! Flipped and Stand By Me both make me wish my childhood was full of more adventure and fun rather than just me sitting on the computer writing review after review aspiring to be a critic. I get tears in my eyes to both films because I become so attached to the characters and they're living the life I can only dream to have. With the exception of unfaithful parents when it comes to Stand By Me.What came to mind halfway through the film was why couldn't the movie Speak have been this good? This film proves more than 80% can be done by narration from TWO characters different perspective and it can be done well. Why not do the same for Speak? Most of the dialog in this film is internal and not directly word of mouth and it works. Why not treat Speak the same way? Were they afraid they would mess it up? It begs an explanation to why Laurie Halse Anderson's novel's potential on film was unfaithful to it's film companion.Never reading the book, I do know that it was set in the nineties and the two thousands while this film's setting is in the late fifties and early sixties. It's not that big of a deal with the drastic setting change, but maybe I would've been more upset if I was a huge fan of the book to find out the film was set four years in the past.The movie about Bryce Loski (McAuliffe), a kid who moves into the neighborhood at a young age to immediately become eye candy to his new neighbor Juli Baker (Carroll). Bryce is resistant, while Juli is persistent. She is positive Bryce will give her her first kiss and believes Bryce is just a little shy, when really he wants nothing to do with her. Juli continues up until present day middle school to give Bryce the chance to admit his ""feelings"" for her but doesn't.Juli lives across the street from Bryce and her yard is an eyesore. It's paid for by the landlord since most of the money Juli and her family makes is given to Juli's father's mentally challenged brother. Bryce's family, his dad mostly, is annoyed by Juli and her family's crappy yard and continue to bad mouth and make assumptions about the Baker family when they really have no idea what it's like over there.The film is narrated by both leads more often than not. Usually we'll get five minutes or so of Bryce narrating his side of the story, while Juli narrates her's. It's almost an anthology because we see what goes on from Bryce's standpoint while hearing his thoughts at the moment and then we see what happened prior or after the events of Bryce's because we then go to Juli. It's confusing. But it works all the time.At the beginning of the film I thought the narrations were only used for the audience to get affiliated with the lives of the characters and what happened before we got here. We spend ninety minutes or longer with movie characters and some films don't even give you the damn courtesy to provide us with any kind of background information. We are supposed to just be thrown into a film with characters we sometimes don't even find out the last names to.The one minor problem I have with the film is the end. It leaves off on the wrong note. The film is only ninety minutes when it could and should be longer. The place they ended was fine, but the scenes on the DVD cover and poster never occur in the film. What a letdown.Flipped is 2010's underrated masterpiece and it definitely showcases a worthy coming of age film. It's smooth style of directing, great music, calm feeling even at it's most stressful, and strong leads are more than I could've asked for. Rob Reiner is something else. A true talent in the movie business. Especially when making a movie as heartfelt as this one.Starring: Callan McAuliffe, Madeline Carroll, Rebecca De Mornay, Anthony Edwards, John Mahoney, Penelope Ann Miller, Aidan Quinn, and Kevin Weisman. Directed by: Rob Reiner.

                With a technique borrowed from Casino of the story being told from two different protagonist points of view, Rob Reiner gives us a wonderful family film about first love. Flipped is a lot less bloody and a great deal sweeter than Martin Scorsese's gangster classic.The prosperous Loski family moves into the neighborhood where the ne'er do well Bakers live. On that day in the late fifties the kids that grow up to be Callan McAuliffe and Madeline Carroll set eyes on each other. Carroll thinks McAuliffe is the one, but such decisions at the age of 7 are sometimes reconsidered. And McAuliffe can't see her for beans, she's just an annoying girl which is not atypical for the second grade.Moving into junior high school is a different matter. With the onset of puberty both these kids are experiencing conflicting emotions. McAuliffe acts like a jerk sometimes, Carroll expects a bit much.The families are different. Anthony Edwards who is McAuliffe's dad is a bit of a fathead and has a thing about his neighbor's lifestyle. Their yard contains a chicken coop and is not in good shape and it's bringing down the values of the other property on the block. As for Aidan Quinn who is Carroll's dad and his family lives as it does in order to support his brother who lives in a sanitarium, an expensive private one for the mentally retarded. Quinn is a wonderful dad, but the Bakers live a whole lot like the Micawbers waiting for something to turn up.The women are wiser than the men, Rebecca DeMornay and Penelope Ann Miller the wives of Edwards and Quinn respectively bond. McAuliffe also has the wisdom of his maternal grandfather John Mahoney to lean on. He's a surrogate grandfather to Carroll as well.Rob Reiner came up with a real winner. The kids act like real kids as opposed to Hollywood kids. The grownups are neither all wise Deities or complete idiots. The women young and old do come out better than the men. I think everyone is going to like this one.Flipped is highly rated for family viewing.

                ""All I ever wanted was for Juli Baker to leave me alone.""Flipped is easily the best love story/relationship movie I've seen since (500) Days of Summer. I'm the kind of guy that you couldn't pay to watch a Nicholas Sparks movie, but that doesn't mean that I can't appreciate a good movie about the highs and lows of love. In a year of formulaic, mind-numbing flicks with no imagination or heart like Letters to Juliet, Flipped is a welcome breath of fresh air. It's about 8 or so years in the lives of two kids who meet when when one of them moves into a new neighborhood. Juli (played by Morgan Lily and Madeline Carroll) is instantly smitten by Bryce (Ryan Ketzner and Callan McAuliffe) the second she sees him drive up to his new house. Bryce, being a typical second grade boy, finds her attention embarrassing and unwanted. As they get older, that dynamic between them remains pretty much the same, but we wouldn't have a very interesting movie if that's all there was to it. Eventually Bryce finds himself on the other side of the equation (flipped, get it?), and has to win back the girl he never knew he always wanted.How odd is it that a movie about a couple of kids handles the topic of love in a more mature and genuine way than almost all of the adult-oriented romantic comedies that we're buried under each year? There's no doubt about it that Flipped will make you say ""aww"" on occasion, but there's a lot more to it than just kids being cute. Humor, issues of class, family conflict, and the lost idealism of youth are introduced into the story by Bryce and Juli's respective families, and there are several outright bittersweet or poignant scenes within the story.The movie is shown from the POV's of both main characters, and often the same event will be shown from each of their perspectives. It works really well, as it really helps the viewer to ""get"" both Bryce and Juli. The kids chosen to play the older versions of the two (Carroll and McAuliffe) are both great, the fact that the story is set in 50's or 60's suburbia adds a believable sense of innocence to it all, and there is just a fresh feeling to the movie that I can't really describe with words.I heartily recommend this to anyone who likes a good, well-written movie, regardless of the genre. You can tell that a lot of heart went into making Flipped, and it shows. Great movie.

                'Flipped' is truly a ""real movie"". Probably what most people enjoyed about this movie was that the events that happened in the movie could might as well have been their reality. Many people in this world (if not all) have experienced having a real crush. This movie shows a crush blossoming from both a guy's and a girl's view. It was very interesting to see two viewpoints on this everyday happening. That is what makes this movie so appealing. Viewers get to watch Bryce and Juli's emotions whenever they see the other. Viewers see Bryce and Juli's smiles that they can't help. Viewers get to know who exactly Bryce and Juli are.Anyone and everyone will enjoy this movie or can at least, relate to it. Even adults! This film will surely take you down memory lane and help you remember the feelings you had when you were first in love. I've never experienced being in love before, but this film makes it seem wonderful. I absolutely loved this film.Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe were great in this film! Even if they're very young, they did wonderful jobs in performing here. In each of their scenes, you could sense the emotions that they were feeling and wanted to convey to the viewers. The characters themselves were also very interesting. Particularly Ms. Juli Baker. It was nice to see such a free-spirited teenager, who was very opinionated and didn't let anything stand in her way. The chemistry that both actors had were average. I thought that they showed their most potential when acting by themselves, in their own surroundings.I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that Rob Reiner, the director of this film, was the same person who directed 'When Harry Met Sally' and 'Sleepless in Seattle'. So far, all romantic-comedies that Rob Reiner has directed has not disappointed me. I can't wait for more of his works! All his rom-coms are excellent additions to the romance movie genre.This was an amazing teenage romantic comedy. Surely one of my favorites, right up there with 'When Harry Met Sally'. Do not miss this film. It's baffling to see that this film isn't as popular as it's supposed to be.Viewed on: April 5, 2011 ; December 16, 2011

                Juli just had to take one look at Bryce's blue eyes, and she knew it was true love. Bryce just had to take one notice of Juli's manic desperation, and he knew it was going to be a friendship of torment. I just had to take one look at the film's artfully designed poster, and I knew ""Flipped"" was a film to be savoured.A beautifully told film of first love, we flip from Juli's point of view to Bryce's point of view, very effectively giving us the true nature of their friendship, love and respect they have for each other. Except in the case of middle-school graders, that love and respect can frequently look like embarrassment, mistrust, and shame. All of those emotions are told with intelligence, subtlety and humour.""Flipped"" has all of the comedy, naiveté and bewilderment of first love. It takes the romantic comedy farther by actually giving us characters with real depth. There is more going on than just Juli and Bryce figuring out their love for each other, and every aspect of this film is well written, touching and relevant.""Flipped"" is a cute film for everybody who fondly remembers that fiercely independent girl or the guy with piercing blue eyes that lived across the street.

","
                ""Flipped"" is superbly directed by Rob Reiner and in my book, one of his best movies. It's a wonderfully told coming-of-age story, which I could relate to in many ways. The main two characters, Juli and Bryce, are very likable. Their parents, played by Penelope Ann Miller and Aidan Quinn, Rebecca de Mornay and Anthony Edwards, respectively, are believable in their roles, which they play excellently. I liked the fact that the story is told from two points of views, Bryce first and then Juli. If you want to see a really feel-good movie, instead of watching some dumb comedy or shoot 'em up flick, go see FLIPPED! You will not regret it.

                I just discovered this gem on Netflix and was impressed, moved and entertained. Its a romantic film about puppy love, so it may not be for everyone (even teens) but I found the leads to be charming and charismatic. The plot device is nothing new, but the charm and early 60's setting make it fresh in many ways. A wonderful cast led by the young leads (now grown!), the late John Mahoney and Aidan Quinn help make this film watchable and enjoyable. A wholesome movie with wonderful moments.

                The first few minutes sent me back a decade reminding how much we avoided girls or getting our names attached to one..I really liked how the story showed a basic fact (mostly at least) :""The one you love doesn't love you back, and you don't love the one that loves you!""Though the main story is not that all can relate to, the background or the base of the story was really nice. The character development was good, not like many movies which focus on only the main characters. Though the story was a little predictable, the movie is enjoyable and among a few to which we can relate to.This movie is definitely worth a watch.And it deserves an 8 out of 10.

","
                Back in 1973, an episode of ""All in the Family"" told the same story from three different perspectives, one of which was from the point of view of Mike ""Meathead"" Stivic, played by Rob Reiner. Watching his latest directorial effort, I wondered if the ""he said / she said"" gimmick of that episode (""Everybody Tells the Truth"") was what attracted Reiner to ""Flipped,"" the young-adult novel by Wendelin Van Draanen, which employs the same multi-POV technique that Lawrence Durrell perfected with his ""Alexandria Quartet"" in the late 1950s. The film version of ""Flipped"" shows Reiner at the top of his form, a worthy addition to an ouevre that includes such classics as ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" ""Misery,"" ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Stand By Me,"" the 1986 period piece that ""Flipped"" most recalls, with its younger characters and coming-of-age theme. At the heart of ""Flipped"" is Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll), a smart, pretty and thoughtful girl who you just can't help losing your heart to. Juli herself flips for Bryce Loski, who is at first repelled by Juli and then slowly starts to see her for the lovely person she is. The cast is augmented by such pros as John Mahoney (Frasier's dad on ""Cheers""), Anthony Edwards, Aidan Quinn and Rebecca De Mornay and Penelope Ann Miller. The film offers up various slices of life from the late '50s and early '60s that makes for a nostalgic, romantic and very moving film. Special kudos to the filmmakers for finding a girl to play young Juli (Morgan Lily) who looks chillingly like Madeline Carroll; I would have bet anything the two were sisters. For those who are bored by the dumb-dumb summer comedies of 2010 (""The Other Guys,"" ""Dinner for Schmucks"") and the special-effects hijinks of ""Inception,"" this is a tender and emotionally satisfying journey that will stay with you for years.

                I really, really liked this film and now wonder why it didn't make more impact when it debuted. Perhaps it was just one of those films that slipped between the cracks because ""Flipped"" is a wonderful coming of age film--and is among director Rob Reiner's best.The film is set mostly in the early 1960s. A young boy, Bryce, moves to a new neighborhood and almost instantly the girl across the street, Juli, begins mooning over him and acting like she's infatuated with him. But he's 7--and hating girls and mushy stuff is normal and he resists her charms. But she persists as the years pass--and she's convinced herself that Bryce is her dream boy. But, as the years pass, Bryce is just as convinced that Juli is a pest. However, eventually, Bryce's attitude starts to change...too bad Juli's is as well!This is a remarkable film in so many ways. The direction is wonderful--perfectly paced and very sweet. The writing is also exceptionally sweet and enchanting. It also helped that there were some wonderful supporting actors to assist in telling the story-- some characters you really liked and cared about and a couple who were complete jerks. John Mahoney was particularly good, but the entire cast was wonderful in this movie. Overall, the elements all work together to tell a sweet story that anyone could love. My only quibble, and it's a very minor one, is about the music. Too many older films are saturated with oldies music. While a bit is nice, with some it sounds more like a best of record album...and at times I would have preferred ""Flipped"" to have been a bit quieter. Not a major complaint by any means and I still give this film a well deserved 9.

                Okay, let's dispense immediately with the idea that this film is geared toward teenagers and all of their sap that they go through. I assure you ""mature adults"" out there that this film will delight you also, unless you are a completely hopelessly lost Scrooge. This film should make sense to all ages. Everyone should identify with it. I don't care what kind of a snob, low-life, big wig, or puritan you are, you should enjoy this film. It's never too sappy when it deals with matters of the heart, nor is it too blunt and insensitive.The film is told almost entirely in a voice over of one of the two main characters. It's told in a brilliant he-said she-said style where the same scene is often told twice from the two opposite points of view (Juli's and Bryce's). So we see the opening scene twice. The first time as explained by Bryce, and the second time explained by Juli. This sort of formula is used many a time in the unfolding battle of the sexes. Of course this doesn't happen in every scene—that would get boring. Director Reiner gives us the proper dosage of everything in this film. The proper amount of comedy, romance, and the proper amount of sadness. Never is it sappy or indulgent or even presumptuous. It's a perfect film for what it's worth. The screenplay is absolutely the work of a fine craftsman—or craftsmen Andrew Scheinman and director Reiner. I don't know how long it took to write or how much blood went into it, but this film is the result of excellent work in every department. The two child stars are perfect in their roles (although Bryce could have done better), but the strength of the cast are in supporting actors. The cast is full of great actors, particularly Anthony Edwards as Bryce's arrogant, critical, smart-Aleck father, and the ever-welcome Aidan Quinn as Juli's loving, down-to-earth, tree painting father.I wasn't completely convinced of the excellence of the film until a beautiful scene in which Mr. Baker (Quinn) and Juli go to visit Mr. Baker's mentally retarded brother Daniel, who is so happy with the world and everything in it. But this scene can't be expressed in words, you have to see it. For what it's worth, Flipped is somewhat of a deep film, full of parallels to the real world. All of the characters have the proper amount of development, even the big sycamore tree that Juli likes to sit in and watch the sunrise. Her exploits while up in that tree are so poetic and beautiful when matched up with the pictures on screen. It's a beautiful and insightful scene into the thoughts and feelings of people in general, not just a teenage girl.In this day when films are almost all big-budget action movies with loud explosions, Flipped has explosions of its own kind. It has explosions of heart and feeling and character, all at the appropriate times. I did not find any ax to grind here. Other than the characters, plot, and screenplay, it's also a technically beautiful film. The camera captures everything so clearly with the proper color timing and excellently framed shots. After the mid-way point of the film, being surrounded by excellence, one starts to look for any reason to criticize the film. I found none. Every nuance of the film is done so genteelly and honestly, who can have a problem with it? This film achieves what movies are meant to achieve. They are meant to reach into are minds and draw us in, to entertain and to move us with fright, emotion, tears, laughs, whatever may be the subject. They are meant to create a world around us, whether in space, in the Wild West, in the future, in Bible times, or in the case of Flipped in 1960s suburbia. This film does exactly what it is meant to do. To touch and make us laugh and to remember. That's what it does. It makes us remember what happened or is happening to us. No one can give this a bad review. I don't see how anyone can pick a fight with the film. But I'm blabbing about nothing.In short, Flipped is by far the best film I've seen this year. I do hope the Academy doesn't overlook this like they do so many other ""family"" films. It should at least get a few nominations, if not a win. We'll see what happens. It's only July.www.colewebbharter.com

                This is a coming of age film set initially and briefly in the late 1950s and mostly in the early 1960s. The boy, Bryce, is chased by his neighbor girl, Juli. And is he chased! Juli is immediately smitten or ""flipped"" by Bryce's eyes and the story unfolds.What is unusual about the story telling is that each major event is played back twice - once through the eyes and voice of Bryce and once through the eyes and voice of Juli. It's the same scene, but you wouldn't know that from their differing viewpoints.Juli is the adventurous and interesting one. Bryce just wants to fit in at their Junior High School. Juli slowly begins to unlike Bryce and Bryce slowly begins to appreciate Juli. Will they ever meet at the same emotional place at the same time? That is the drama and story.The art direction and era are right on. It is the Eisenhower and Kennedy years in look, and even in feel. The wives are subordinate to the husbands. The children are mostly respectful to their parents. And the teachers teach and the students learn. But, you can see the seeds being laid for the rebellious war babies of the late 1960s.Rob Reiner is a talented director for romances - ""When Harry Met Sally."" And he is a talented director for handling young actors - ""Stand By Me."" He combines these talents to help us understand the better part of the human condition; that is, love, respect, sacrifice, forgiveness, and honor. And we have fun and laugh along the way. This is like the TV program, ""Wonder Years"" - but heightened and deepened.-Bob, a Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award Jury Member

                Flipped is a one in a million film - I mean, REALLY one in a million. It's refreshing and lovely, dramatic and hilarious. It does what few films do in our time (or rather what they don't do): Flipped does not sacrifice its integrity for raunchy, gratuitous content. It's real. The emotions are real. The characters are real. And while it certainly isn't G-rated fluff (and do not be fooled - this is not a film for young children), the movie is definitely gentle and innocent in many ways. On the downside, without giving anything away, the ending of the film could have been better patched together, but overall the movie is a cinematic gem like no other. Go see Flipped!

                Beautifully told with all the ingredients for a good family movie. The story is told from two different views, the view from the boy and from the girl. A boy who is annoyed by all the attention he gets from the girl across the street. The girl from across the street who has a super crush on the boy tells her part of the story. The boy's father is a man filled with hatred who dispenses politically incorrect lines throughout the movie. The grandfather, the great John Mohoney, is the wise person who tells the boy to really see the girl for what she is, a very special girl. I don't want to give anything away of this jewel of a movie. I enjoyed this movie very much and totally recommend it.

                A very enjoyable movie, effectively embracing the coming of age sensitivities which come to us all. Although it is clear there are many nuances of other characters which never get dealt with, it's meant to be that way. This is about the kids, the effect they have on one another, their ability and inability to express their feelings, and what can happen when we finally face our fears about the other sex and dare to take a step toward resolving them. The only issue I have is that the film simply has too many anachronisms -- songs not of the period and figures of speech clearly from the present and not the fifties and sixties, but hey, I'm too darn picky about that stuff. Reiner has done it again, offering us a film in the style and tone of Capra. He has crafted a film of sensitivity and grace, and taught us something about life that most of us lose upon becoming adults. Madeline Carroll is simply wonderful as the independent teen taking life head on, and is a true pleasure to watch. She absolutely carries this film.

                Of all the movies I've seen lately, Flipped was amongst the most refreshing. If it had been done by a different director and had different screenwriters, it might be a terrible cliché. Story of first love, known each other since kids, bla bla bla, we've all heard it before.But this movie, it was so pure and so realistic, which is what I love about it most. It wasn't over the top romantic, but it was enough to tug my heartstrings and made me go ""awwww"" instead of going ""ewwww"".The characters felt like real people, and the issues faced in the story felt so real and believable, it made me believe in the basic form of love once more, and that it still existed in real life (even though I know it's just in the movies, but still).Anyway, if you're looking for a story that is refreshing yet vintage, and wanting to have a lovey-dovey grin plastered on your face, then this is the movie to watch.

","
                Flipped is a sweet, charming, moving, lovely, well-acted coming-of-age romantic drama comedy film.While the plot offers nothing new in particular (as with mostly all rom- com films)...the 'girl meets boy' mixed with 'the not-your-typical girl next door' story, but the storytelling is slightly different. Adapted from the book with the same name by Wendelin Van Draanen, the film is presented in a rather unique 'he-said she-said' style, through the eyes and thoughts of the male lead, Bryce and then again through the eyes and thoughts of female lead, Juli, alternately presenting their views and perspectives on a shared set of events. Nearly every single event that happened in the film is told at least twice, although it seems repetitive, but surprisingly, it never feels boring or annoying. It's actually fascinating and insightful to be able to see into the thoughts and feelings of people in general. Things are not really what it seems and there's always more than meets the eye. As the film progresses, you are so emotionally invested in the characters that you actually begin to eagerly anticipate what the other side of the story might be, how the other person feels the way he/she does. The film also gives a feeling of nostalgia, even for those who never lived in the era (the story is set in 50's or 60's suburban area) or experienced the same events as the two leads. It feels authentic and relatable nonetheless. Juli might appear as an ordinary girl, but she's a sweet, kind, beautiful, daring girl at heart once you get to know her.The two lead stars are perfect in their respective roles. Most of the characters in the film have sufficient character development for the audience to understand them. Flipped is a period young love story, told in a simple and heartfelt manner. A rare cinematic gem.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/shorter-movie-review-flipped.html Rating: 8/10""A painting is more than the sum of its parts. A cow by itself is just a cow.

                I feel that this is not a movie about love and first love, but how people should treat themselves and others who seem to be incompatible with their surroundings, how to face the embarrassment and difficulties in life, and learn and grow.

","
                Flipped is a coming of age film directed by the coming of age master director Rob Reiner. Reiner directed the tear-jerker Stand By Me and is now back to bring Wendelin Van Draanen's novel of the same name to life. What a treat! Flipped and Stand By Me both make me wish my childhood was full of more adventure and fun rather than just me sitting on the computer writing review after review aspiring to be a critic. I get tears in my eyes to both films because I become so attached to the characters and they're living the life I can only dream to have. With the exception of unfaithful parents when it comes to Stand By Me.What came to mind halfway through the film was why couldn't the movie Speak have been this good? This film proves more than 80% can be done by narration from TWO characters different perspective and it can be done well. Why not do the same for Speak? Most of the dialog in this film is internal and not directly word of mouth and it works. Why not treat Speak the same way? Were they afraid they would mess it up? It begs an explanation to why Laurie Halse Anderson's novel's potential on film was unfaithful to it's film companion.Never reading the book, I do know that it was set in the nineties and the two thousands while this film's setting is in the late fifties and early sixties. It's not that big of a deal with the drastic setting change, but maybe I would've been more upset if I was a huge fan of the book to find out the film was set four years in the past.The movie about Bryce Loski (McAuliffe), a kid who moves into the neighborhood at a young age to immediately become eye candy to his new neighbor Juli Baker (Carroll). Bryce is resistant, while Juli is persistent. She is positive Bryce will give her her first kiss and believes Bryce is just a little shy, when really he wants nothing to do with her. Juli continues up until present day middle school to give Bryce the chance to admit his ""feelings"" for her but doesn't.Juli lives across the street from Bryce and her yard is an eyesore. It's paid for by the landlord since most of the money Juli and her family makes is given to Juli's father's mentally challenged brother. Bryce's family, his dad mostly, is annoyed by Juli and her family's crappy yard and continue to bad mouth and make assumptions about the Baker family when they really have no idea what it's like over there.The film is narrated by both leads more often than not. Usually we'll get five minutes or so of Bryce narrating his side of the story, while Juli narrates her's. It's almost an anthology because we see what goes on from Bryce's standpoint while hearing his thoughts at the moment and then we see what happened prior or after the events of Bryce's because we then go to Juli. It's confusing. But it works all the time.At the beginning of the film I thought the narrations were only used for the audience to get affiliated with the lives of the characters and what happened before we got here. We spend ninety minutes or longer with movie characters and some films don't even give you the damn courtesy to provide us with any kind of background information. We are supposed to just be thrown into a film with characters we sometimes don't even find out the last names to.The one minor problem I have with the film is the end. It leaves off on the wrong note. The film is only ninety minutes when it could and should be longer. The place they ended was fine, but the scenes on the DVD cover and poster never occur in the film. What a letdown.Flipped is 2010's underrated masterpiece and it definitely showcases a worthy coming of age film. It's smooth style of directing, great music, calm feeling even at it's most stressful, and strong leads are more than I could've asked for. Rob Reiner is something else. A true talent in the movie business. Especially when making a movie as heartfelt as this one.Starring: Callan McAuliffe, Madeline Carroll, Rebecca De Mornay, Anthony Edwards, John Mahoney, Penelope Ann Miller, Aidan Quinn, and Kevin Weisman. Directed by: Rob Reiner.

                With a technique borrowed from Casino of the story being told from two different protagonist points of view, Rob Reiner gives us a wonderful family film about first love. Flipped is a lot less bloody and a great deal sweeter than Martin Scorsese's gangster classic.The prosperous Loski family moves into the neighborhood where the ne'er do well Bakers live. On that day in the late fifties the kids that grow up to be Callan McAuliffe and Madeline Carroll set eyes on each other. Carroll thinks McAuliffe is the one, but such decisions at the age of 7 are sometimes reconsidered. And McAuliffe can't see her for beans, she's just an annoying girl which is not atypical for the second grade.Moving into junior high school is a different matter. With the onset of puberty both these kids are experiencing conflicting emotions. McAuliffe acts like a jerk sometimes, Carroll expects a bit much.The families are different. Anthony Edwards who is McAuliffe's dad is a bit of a fathead and has a thing about his neighbor's lifestyle. Their yard contains a chicken coop and is not in good shape and it's bringing down the values of the other property on the block. As for Aidan Quinn who is Carroll's dad and his family lives as it does in order to support his brother who lives in a sanitarium, an expensive private one for the mentally retarded. Quinn is a wonderful dad, but the Bakers live a whole lot like the Micawbers waiting for something to turn up.The women are wiser than the men, Rebecca DeMornay and Penelope Ann Miller the wives of Edwards and Quinn respectively bond. McAuliffe also has the wisdom of his maternal grandfather John Mahoney to lean on. He's a surrogate grandfather to Carroll as well.Rob Reiner came up with a real winner. The kids act like real kids as opposed to Hollywood kids. The grownups are neither all wise Deities or complete idiots. The women young and old do come out better than the men. I think everyone is going to like this one.Flipped is highly rated for family viewing.

And then when Bryce did some really mean things to her, I could once again totally empathize with Juli and thought he was a complete jerk. The whole story was very relatable to me in general.

                ""All I ever wanted was for Juli Baker to leave me alone.""Flipped is easily the best love story/relationship movie I've seen since (500) Days of Summer. I'm the kind of guy that you couldn't pay to watch a Nicholas Sparks movie, but that doesn't mean that I can't appreciate a good movie about the highs and lows of love. In a year of formulaic, mind-numbing flicks with no imagination or heart like Letters to Juliet, Flipped is a welcome breath of fresh air. It's about 8 or so years in the lives of two kids who meet when when one of them moves into a new neighborhood. Juli (played by Morgan Lily and Madeline Carroll) is instantly smitten by Bryce (Ryan Ketzner and Callan McAuliffe) the second she sees him drive up to his new house. Bryce, being a typical second grade boy, finds her attention embarrassing and unwanted. As they get older, that dynamic between them remains pretty much the same, but we wouldn't have a very interesting movie if that's all there was to it. Eventually Bryce finds himself on the other side of the equation (flipped, get it?), and has to win back the girl he never knew he always wanted.How odd is it that a movie about a couple of kids handles the topic of love in a more mature and genuine way than almost all of the adult-oriented romantic comedies that we're buried under each year? There's no doubt about it that Flipped will make you say ""aww"" on occasion, but there's a lot more to it than just kids being cute. Humor, issues of class, family conflict, and the lost idealism of youth are introduced into the story by Bryce and Juli's respective families, and there are several outright bittersweet or poignant scenes within the story.The movie is shown from the POV's of both main characters, and often the same event will be shown from each of their perspectives. It works really well, as it really helps the viewer to ""get"" both Bryce and Juli. The kids chosen to play the older versions of the two (Carroll and McAuliffe) are both great, the fact that the story is set in 50's or 60's suburbia adds a believable sense of innocence to it all, and there is just a fresh feeling to the movie that I can't really describe with words.I heartily recommend this to anyone who likes a good, well-written movie, regardless of the genre. You can tell that a lot of heart went into making Flipped, and it shows. Great movie.

                'Flipped' is truly a ""real movie"". Probably what most people enjoyed about this movie was that the events that happened in the movie could might as well have been their reality. Many people in this world (if not all) have experienced having a real crush. This movie shows a crush blossoming from both a guy's and a girl's view. It was very interesting to see two viewpoints on this everyday happening. That is what makes this movie so appealing. Viewers get to watch Bryce and Juli's emotions whenever they see the other. Viewers see Bryce and Juli's smiles that they can't help. Viewers get to know who exactly Bryce and Juli are.Anyone and everyone will enjoy this movie or can at least, relate to it. Even adults! This film will surely take you down memory lane and help you remember the feelings you had when you were first in love. I've never experienced being in love before, but this film makes it seem wonderful. I absolutely loved this film.Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe were great in this film! Even if they're very young, they did wonderful jobs in performing here. In each of their scenes, you could sense the emotions that they were feeling and wanted to convey to the viewers. The characters themselves were also very interesting. Particularly Ms. Juli Baker. It was nice to see such a free-spirited teenager, who was very opinionated and didn't let anything stand in her way. The chemistry that both actors had were average. I thought that they showed their most potential when acting by themselves, in their own surroundings.I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that Rob Reiner, the director of this film, was the same person who directed 'When Harry Met Sally' and 'Sleepless in Seattle'. So far, all romantic-comedies that Rob Reiner has directed has not disappointed me. I can't wait for more of his works! All his rom-coms are excellent additions to the romance movie genre.This was an amazing teenage romantic comedy. Surely one of my favorites, right up there with 'When Harry Met Sally'. Do not miss this film. It's baffling to see that this film isn't as popular as it's supposed to be.Viewed on: April 5, 2011 ; December 16, 2011

                Juli just had to take one look at Bryce's blue eyes, and she knew it was true love. Bryce just had to take one notice of Juli's manic desperation, and he knew it was going to be a friendship of torment. I just had to take one look at the film's artfully designed poster, and I knew ""Flipped"" was a film to be savoured.A beautifully told film of first love, we flip from Juli's point of view to Bryce's point of view, very effectively giving us the true nature of their friendship, love and respect they have for each other. Except in the case of middle-school graders, that love and respect can frequently look like embarrassment, mistrust, and shame. All of those emotions are told with intelligence, subtlety and humour.""Flipped"" has all of the comedy, naiveté and bewilderment of first love. It takes the romantic comedy farther by actually giving us characters with real depth. There is more going on than just Juli and Bryce figuring out their love for each other, and every aspect of this film is well written, touching and relevant.""Flipped"" is a cute film for everybody who fondly remembers that fiercely independent girl or the guy with piercing blue eyes that lived across the street.

                ""Flipped"" is superbly directed by Rob Reiner and in my book, one of his best movies. It's a wonderfully told coming-of-age story, which I could relate to in many ways. The main two characters, Juli and Bryce, are very likable. Their parents, played by Penelope Ann Miller and Aidan Quinn, Rebecca de Mornay and Anthony Edwards, respectively, are believable in their roles, which they play excellently. I liked the fact that the story is told from two points of views, Bryce first and then Juli. If you want to see a really feel-good movie, instead of watching some dumb comedy or shoot 'em up flick, go see FLIPPED! You will not regret it.

                I just discovered this gem on Netflix and was impressed, moved and entertained. Its a romantic film about puppy love, so it may not be for everyone (even teens) but I found the leads to be charming and charismatic. The plot device is nothing new, but the charm and early 60's setting make it fresh in many ways. A wonderful cast led by the young leads (now grown!), the late John Mahoney and Aidan Quinn help make this film watchable and enjoyable. A wholesome movie with wonderful moments.

The character development was good, not like many movies which focus on only the main characters.

                Back in 1973, an episode of ""All in the Family"" told the same story from three different perspectives, one of which was from the point of view of Mike ""Meathead"" Stivic, played by Rob Reiner. Watching his latest directorial effort, I wondered if the ""he said / she said"" gimmick of that episode (""Everybody Tells the Truth"") was what attracted Reiner to ""Flipped,"" the young-adult novel by Wendelin Van Draanen, which employs the same multi-POV technique that Lawrence Durrell perfected with his ""Alexandria Quartet"" in the late 1950s. The film version of ""Flipped"" shows Reiner at the top of his form, a worthy addition to an ouevre that includes such classics as ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" ""Misery,"" ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Stand By Me,"" the 1986 period piece that ""Flipped"" most recalls, with its younger characters and coming-of-age theme. At the heart of ""Flipped"" is Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll), a smart, pretty and thoughtful girl who you just can't help losing your heart to. Juli herself flips for Bryce Loski, who is at first repelled by Juli and then slowly starts to see her for the lovely person she is. The cast is augmented by such pros as John Mahoney (Frasier's dad on ""Cheers""), Anthony Edwards, Aidan Quinn and Rebecca De Mornay and Penelope Ann Miller. The film offers up various slices of life from the late '50s and early '60s that makes for a nostalgic, romantic and very moving film. Special kudos to the filmmakers for finding a girl to play young Juli (Morgan Lily) who looks chillingly like Madeline Carroll; I would have bet anything the two were sisters. For those who are bored by the dumb-dumb summer comedies of 2010 (""The Other Guys,"" ""Dinner for Schmucks"") and the special-effects hijinks of ""Inception,"" this is a tender and emotionally satisfying journey that will stay with you for years.

                I really, really liked this film and now wonder why it didn't make more impact when it debuted. Perhaps it was just one of those films that slipped between the cracks because ""Flipped"" is a wonderful coming of age film--and is among director Rob Reiner's best.The film is set mostly in the early 1960s. A young boy, Bryce, moves to a new neighborhood and almost instantly the girl across the street, Juli, begins mooning over him and acting like she's infatuated with him. But he's 7--and hating girls and mushy stuff is normal and he resists her charms. But she persists as the years pass--and she's convinced herself that Bryce is her dream boy. But, as the years pass, Bryce is just as convinced that Juli is a pest. However, eventually, Bryce's attitude starts to change...too bad Juli's is as well!This is a remarkable film in so many ways. The direction is wonderful--perfectly paced and very sweet. The writing is also exceptionally sweet and enchanting. It also helped that there were some wonderful supporting actors to assist in telling the story-- some characters you really liked and cared about and a couple who were complete jerks. John Mahoney was particularly good, but the entire cast was wonderful in this movie. Overall, the elements all work together to tell a sweet story that anyone could love. My only quibble, and it's a very minor one, is about the music. Too many older films are saturated with oldies music. While a bit is nice, with some it sounds more like a best of record album...and at times I would have preferred ""Flipped"" to have been a bit quieter. Not a major complaint by any means and I still give this film a well deserved 9.

                Okay, let's dispense immediately with the idea that this film is geared toward teenagers and all of their sap that they go through. I assure you ""mature adults"" out there that this film will delight you also, unless you are a completely hopelessly lost Scrooge. This film should make sense to all ages. Everyone should identify with it. I don't care what kind of a snob, low-life, big wig, or puritan you are, you should enjoy this film. It's never too sappy when it deals with matters of the heart, nor is it too blunt and insensitive.The film is told almost entirely in a voice over of one of the two main characters. It's told in a brilliant he-said she-said style where the same scene is often told twice from the two opposite points of view (Juli's and Bryce's). So we see the opening scene twice. The first time as explained by Bryce, and the second time explained by Juli. This sort of formula is used many a time in the unfolding battle of the sexes. Of course this doesn't happen in every scene—that would get boring. Director Reiner gives us the proper dosage of everything in this film. The proper amount of comedy, romance, and the proper amount of sadness. Never is it sappy or indulgent or even presumptuous. It's a perfect film for what it's worth. The screenplay is absolutely the work of a fine craftsman—or craftsmen Andrew Scheinman and director Reiner. I don't know how long it took to write or how much blood went into it, but this film is the result of excellent work in every department. The two child stars are perfect in their roles (although Bryce could have done better), but the strength of the cast are in supporting actors. The cast is full of great actors, particularly Anthony Edwards as Bryce's arrogant, critical, smart-Aleck father, and the ever-welcome Aidan Quinn as Juli's loving, down-to-earth, tree painting father.I wasn't completely convinced of the excellence of the film until a beautiful scene in which Mr. Baker (Quinn) and Juli go to visit Mr. Baker's mentally retarded brother Daniel, who is so happy with the world and everything in it. But this scene can't be expressed in words, you have to see it. For what it's worth, Flipped is somewhat of a deep film, full of parallels to the real world. All of the characters have the proper amount of development, even the big sycamore tree that Juli likes to sit in and watch the sunrise. Her exploits while up in that tree are so poetic and beautiful when matched up with the pictures on screen. It's a beautiful and insightful scene into the thoughts and feelings of people in general, not just a teenage girl.In this day when films are almost all big-budget action movies with loud explosions, Flipped has explosions of its own kind. It has explosions of heart and feeling and character, all at the appropriate times. I did not find any ax to grind here. Other than the characters, plot, and screenplay, it's also a technically beautiful film. The camera captures everything so clearly with the proper color timing and excellently framed shots. After the mid-way point of the film, being surrounded by excellence, one starts to look for any reason to criticize the film. I found none. Every nuance of the film is done so genteelly and honestly, who can have a problem with it? This film achieves what movies are meant to achieve. They are meant to reach into are minds and draw us in, to entertain and to move us with fright, emotion, tears, laughs, whatever may be the subject. They are meant to create a world around us, whether in space, in the Wild West, in the future, in Bible times, or in the case of Flipped in 1960s suburbia. This film does exactly what it is meant to do. To touch and make us laugh and to remember. That's what it does. It makes us remember what happened or is happening to us. No one can give this a bad review. I don't see how anyone can pick a fight with the film. But I'm blabbing about nothing.In short, Flipped is by far the best film I've seen this year. I do hope the Academy doesn't overlook this like they do so many other ""family"" films. It should at least get a few nominations, if not a win. We'll see what happens. It's only July.www.colewebbharter.com

                This is a coming of age film set initially and briefly in the late 1950s and mostly in the early 1960s. The boy, Bryce, is chased by his neighbor girl, Juli. And is he chased! Juli is immediately smitten or ""flipped"" by Bryce's eyes and the story unfolds.What is unusual about the story telling is that each major event is played back twice - once through the eyes and voice of Bryce and once through the eyes and voice of Juli. It's the same scene, but you wouldn't know that from their differing viewpoints.Juli is the adventurous and interesting one. Bryce just wants to fit in at their Junior High School. Juli slowly begins to unlike Bryce and Bryce slowly begins to appreciate Juli. Will they ever meet at the same emotional place at the same time? That is the drama and story.The art direction and era are right on. It is the Eisenhower and Kennedy years in look, and even in feel. The wives are subordinate to the husbands. The children are mostly respectful to their parents. And the teachers teach and the students learn. But, you can see the seeds being laid for the rebellious war babies of the late 1960s.Rob Reiner is a talented director for romances - ""When Harry Met Sally."" And he is a talented director for handling young actors - ""Stand By Me."" He combines these talents to help us understand the better part of the human condition; that is, love, respect, sacrifice, forgiveness, and honor. And we have fun and laugh along the way. This is like the TV program, ""Wonder Years"" - but heightened and deepened.-Bob, a Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award Jury Member

                Flipped is a one in a million film - I mean, REALLY one in a million. It's refreshing and lovely, dramatic and hilarious. It does what few films do in our time (or rather what they don't do): Flipped does not sacrifice its integrity for raunchy, gratuitous content. It's real. The emotions are real. The characters are real. And while it certainly isn't G-rated fluff (and do not be fooled - this is not a film for young children), the movie is definitely gentle and innocent in many ways. On the downside, without giving anything away, the ending of the film could have been better patched together, but overall the movie is a cinematic gem like no other. Go see Flipped!

                Juli flipped over Bryce. Bryce's dad flips out. Mom and sister wear their hair in a flip.Charming tale told in a ""he said she said"" often voice-over manner. Interesting enough and short enough so the style doesn't detract. Don't let the print ads mislead you. Bryce never climbs the tree.Excellent performances from the entire cast. Outstanding use of period music. Great collection of shinning '57 Chevy's.Courage, family values, character and nothing explodes. People of every age are treated with respect. What a refreshing movie. Archie Bunker was wrong, Rob Reiner got it right again. He's no meat-head.

                Beautifully told with all the ingredients for a good family movie. The story is told from two different views, the view from the boy and from the girl. A boy who is annoyed by all the attention he gets from the girl across the street. The girl from across the street who has a super crush on the boy tells her part of the story. The boy's father is a man filled with hatred who dispenses politically incorrect lines throughout the movie. The grandfather, the great John Mohoney, is the wise person who tells the boy to really see the girl for what she is, a very special girl. I don't want to give anything away of this jewel of a movie. I enjoyed this movie very much and totally recommend it.

Also,I bought this impressive American novel last year,which is as great as the movie.

                A very enjoyable movie, effectively embracing the coming of age sensitivities which come to us all. Although it is clear there are many nuances of other characters which never get dealt with, it's meant to be that way. This is about the kids, the effect they have on one another, their ability and inability to express their feelings, and what can happen when we finally face our fears about the other sex and dare to take a step toward resolving them. The only issue I have is that the film simply has too many anachronisms -- songs not of the period and figures of speech clearly from the present and not the fifties and sixties, but hey, I'm too darn picky about that stuff. Reiner has done it again, offering us a film in the style and tone of Capra. He has crafted a film of sensitivity and grace, and taught us something about life that most of us lose upon becoming adults. Madeline Carroll is simply wonderful as the independent teen taking life head on, and is a true pleasure to watch. She absolutely carries this film.

                Of all the movies I've seen lately, Flipped was amongst the most refreshing. If it had been done by a different director and had different screenwriters, it might be a terrible cliché. Story of first love, known each other since kids, bla bla bla, we've all heard it before.But this movie, it was so pure and so realistic, which is what I love about it most. It wasn't over the top romantic, but it was enough to tug my heartstrings and made me go ""awwww"" instead of going ""ewwww"".The characters felt like real people, and the issues faced in the story felt so real and believable, it made me believe in the basic form of love once more, and that it still existed in real life (even though I know it's just in the movies, but still).Anyway, if you're looking for a story that is refreshing yet vintage, and wanting to have a lovey-dovey grin plastered on your face, then this is the movie to watch.

                Flipped is a sweet, charming, moving, lovely, well-acted coming-of-age romantic drama comedy film.While the plot offers nothing new in particular (as with mostly all rom- com films)...the 'girl meets boy' mixed with 'the not-your-typical girl next door' story, but the storytelling is slightly different. Adapted from the book with the same name by Wendelin Van Draanen, the film is presented in a rather unique 'he-said she-said' style, through the eyes and thoughts of the male lead, Bryce and then again through the eyes and thoughts of female lead, Juli, alternately presenting their views and perspectives on a shared set of events. Nearly every single event that happened in the film is told at least twice, although it seems repetitive, but surprisingly, it never feels boring or annoying. It's actually fascinating and insightful to be able to see into the thoughts and feelings of people in general. Things are not really what it seems and there's always more than meets the eye. As the film progresses, you are so emotionally invested in the characters that you actually begin to eagerly anticipate what the other side of the story might be, how the other person feels the way he/she does. The film also gives a feeling of nostalgia, even for those who never lived in the era (the story is set in 50's or 60's suburban area) or experienced the same events as the two leads. It feels authentic and relatable nonetheless. Juli might appear as an ordinary girl, but she's a sweet, kind, beautiful, daring girl at heart once you get to know her.The two lead stars are perfect in their respective roles. Most of the characters in the film have sufficient character development for the audience to understand them. Flipped is a period young love story, told in a simple and heartfelt manner. A rare cinematic gem.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/shorter-movie-review-flipped.html Rating: 8/10""A painting is more than the sum of its parts. A cow by itself is just a cow.

                Flipped is a coming of age film directed by the coming of age master director Rob Reiner. Reiner directed the tear-jerker Stand By Me and is now back to bring Wendelin Van Draanen's novel of the same name to life. What a treat! Flipped and Stand By Me both make me wish my childhood was full of more adventure and fun rather than just me sitting on the computer writing review after review aspiring to be a critic. I get tears in my eyes to both films because I become so attached to the characters and they're living the life I can only dream to have. With the exception of unfaithful parents when it comes to Stand By Me.What came to mind halfway through the film was why couldn't the movie Speak have been this good? This film proves more than 80% can be done by narration from TWO characters different perspective and it can be done well. Why not do the same for Speak? Most of the dialog in this film is internal and not directly word of mouth and it works. Why not treat Speak the same way? Were they afraid they would mess it up? It begs an explanation to why Laurie Halse Anderson's novel's potential on film was unfaithful to it's film companion.Never reading the book, I do know that it was set in the nineties and the two thousands while this film's setting is in the late fifties and early sixties. It's not that big of a deal with the drastic setting change, but maybe I would've been more upset if I was a huge fan of the book to find out the film was set four years in the past.The movie about Bryce Loski (McAuliffe), a kid who moves into the neighborhood at a young age to immediately become eye candy to his new neighbor Juli Baker (Carroll). Bryce is resistant, while Juli is persistent. She is positive Bryce will give her her first kiss and believes Bryce is just a little shy, when really he wants nothing to do with her. Juli continues up until present day middle school to give Bryce the chance to admit his ""feelings"" for her but doesn't.Juli lives across the street from Bryce and her yard is an eyesore. It's paid for by the landlord since most of the money Juli and her family makes is given to Juli's father's mentally challenged brother. Bryce's family, his dad mostly, is annoyed by Juli and her family's crappy yard and continue to bad mouth and make assumptions about the Baker family when they really have no idea what it's like over there.The film is narrated by both leads more often than not. Usually we'll get five minutes or so of Bryce narrating his side of the story, while Juli narrates her's. It's almost an anthology because we see what goes on from Bryce's standpoint while hearing his thoughts at the moment and then we see what happened prior or after the events of Bryce's because we then go to Juli. It's confusing. But it works all the time.At the beginning of the film I thought the narrations were only used for the audience to get affiliated with the lives of the characters and what happened before we got here. We spend ninety minutes or longer with movie characters and some films don't even give you the damn courtesy to provide us with any kind of background information. We are supposed to just be thrown into a film with characters we sometimes don't even find out the last names to.The one minor problem I have with the film is the end. It leaves off on the wrong note. The film is only ninety minutes when it could and should be longer. The place they ended was fine, but the scenes on the DVD cover and poster never occur in the film. What a letdown.Flipped is 2010's underrated masterpiece and it definitely showcases a worthy coming of age film. It's smooth style of directing, great music, calm feeling even at it's most stressful, and strong leads are more than I could've asked for. Rob Reiner is something else. A true talent in the movie business. Especially when making a movie as heartfelt as this one.Starring: Callan McAuliffe, Madeline Carroll, Rebecca De Mornay, Anthony Edwards, John Mahoney, Penelope Ann Miller, Aidan Quinn, and Kevin Weisman. Directed by: Rob Reiner.

                With a technique borrowed from Casino of the story being told from two different protagonist points of view, Rob Reiner gives us a wonderful family film about first love. Flipped is a lot less bloody and a great deal sweeter than Martin Scorsese's gangster classic.The prosperous Loski family moves into the neighborhood where the ne'er do well Bakers live. On that day in the late fifties the kids that grow up to be Callan McAuliffe and Madeline Carroll set eyes on each other. Carroll thinks McAuliffe is the one, but such decisions at the age of 7 are sometimes reconsidered. And McAuliffe can't see her for beans, she's just an annoying girl which is not atypical for the second grade.Moving into junior high school is a different matter. With the onset of puberty both these kids are experiencing conflicting emotions. McAuliffe acts like a jerk sometimes, Carroll expects a bit much.The families are different. Anthony Edwards who is McAuliffe's dad is a bit of a fathead and has a thing about his neighbor's lifestyle. Their yard contains a chicken coop and is not in good shape and it's bringing down the values of the other property on the block. As for Aidan Quinn who is Carroll's dad and his family lives as it does in order to support his brother who lives in a sanitarium, an expensive private one for the mentally retarded. Quinn is a wonderful dad, but the Bakers live a whole lot like the Micawbers waiting for something to turn up.The women are wiser than the men, Rebecca DeMornay and Penelope Ann Miller the wives of Edwards and Quinn respectively bond. McAuliffe also has the wisdom of his maternal grandfather John Mahoney to lean on. He's a surrogate grandfather to Carroll as well.Rob Reiner came up with a real winner. The kids act like real kids as opposed to Hollywood kids. The grownups are neither all wise Deities or complete idiots. The women young and old do come out better than the men. I think everyone is going to like this one.Flipped is highly rated for family viewing.

                Loved it. Bryce is so handsome, i could totally empathize with Juli when she would talk about his dazzling eyes. And then when Bryce did some really mean things to her, I could once again totally empathize with Juli and thought he was a complete jerk. The whole story was very relatable to me in general.

                ""All I ever wanted was for Juli Baker to leave me alone.""Flipped is easily the best love story/relationship movie I've seen since (500) Days of Summer. I'm the kind of guy that you couldn't pay to watch a Nicholas Sparks movie, but that doesn't mean that I can't appreciate a good movie about the highs and lows of love. In a year of formulaic, mind-numbing flicks with no imagination or heart like Letters to Juliet, Flipped is a welcome breath of fresh air. It's about 8 or so years in the lives of two kids who meet when when one of them moves into a new neighborhood. Juli (played by Morgan Lily and Madeline Carroll) is instantly smitten by Bryce (Ryan Ketzner and Callan McAuliffe) the second she sees him drive up to his new house. Bryce, being a typical second grade boy, finds her attention embarrassing and unwanted. As they get older, that dynamic between them remains pretty much the same, but we wouldn't have a very interesting movie if that's all there was to it. Eventually Bryce finds himself on the other side of the equation (flipped, get it?), and has to win back the girl he never knew he always wanted.How odd is it that a movie about a couple of kids handles the topic of love in a more mature and genuine way than almost all of the adult-oriented romantic comedies that we're buried under each year? There's no doubt about it that Flipped will make you say ""aww"" on occasion, but there's a lot more to it than just kids being cute. Humor, issues of class, family conflict, and the lost idealism of youth are introduced into the story by Bryce and Juli's respective families, and there are several outright bittersweet or poignant scenes within the story.The movie is shown from the POV's of both main characters, and often the same event will be shown from each of their perspectives. It works really well, as it really helps the viewer to ""get"" both Bryce and Juli. The kids chosen to play the older versions of the two (Carroll and McAuliffe) are both great, the fact that the story is set in 50's or 60's suburbia adds a believable sense of innocence to it all, and there is just a fresh feeling to the movie that I can't really describe with words.I heartily recommend this to anyone who likes a good, well-written movie, regardless of the genre. You can tell that a lot of heart went into making Flipped, and it shows. Great movie.

                'Flipped' is truly a ""real movie"". Probably what most people enjoyed about this movie was that the events that happened in the movie could might as well have been their reality. Many people in this world (if not all) have experienced having a real crush. This movie shows a crush blossoming from both a guy's and a girl's view. It was very interesting to see two viewpoints on this everyday happening. That is what makes this movie so appealing. Viewers get to watch Bryce and Juli's emotions whenever they see the other. Viewers see Bryce and Juli's smiles that they can't help. Viewers get to know who exactly Bryce and Juli are.Anyone and everyone will enjoy this movie or can at least, relate to it. Even adults! This film will surely take you down memory lane and help you remember the feelings you had when you were first in love. I've never experienced being in love before, but this film makes it seem wonderful. I absolutely loved this film.Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe were great in this film! Even if they're very young, they did wonderful jobs in performing here. In each of their scenes, you could sense the emotions that they were feeling and wanted to convey to the viewers. The characters themselves were also very interesting. Particularly Ms. Juli Baker. It was nice to see such a free-spirited teenager, who was very opinionated and didn't let anything stand in her way. The chemistry that both actors had were average. I thought that they showed their most potential when acting by themselves, in their own surroundings.I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that Rob Reiner, the director of this film, was the same person who directed 'When Harry Met Sally' and 'Sleepless in Seattle'. So far, all romantic-comedies that Rob Reiner has directed has not disappointed me. I can't wait for more of his works! All his rom-coms are excellent additions to the romance movie genre.This was an amazing teenage romantic comedy. Surely one of my favorites, right up there with 'When Harry Met Sally'. Do not miss this film. It's baffling to see that this film isn't as popular as it's supposed to be.Viewed on: April 5, 2011 ; December 16, 2011

                Juli just had to take one look at Bryce's blue eyes, and she knew it was true love. Bryce just had to take one notice of Juli's manic desperation, and he knew it was going to be a friendship of torment. I just had to take one look at the film's artfully designed poster, and I knew ""Flipped"" was a film to be savoured.A beautifully told film of first love, we flip from Juli's point of view to Bryce's point of view, very effectively giving us the true nature of their friendship, love and respect they have for each other. Except in the case of middle-school graders, that love and respect can frequently look like embarrassment, mistrust, and shame. All of those emotions are told with intelligence, subtlety and humour.""Flipped"" has all of the comedy, naiveté and bewilderment of first love. It takes the romantic comedy farther by actually giving us characters with real depth. There is more going on than just Juli and Bryce figuring out their love for each other, and every aspect of this film is well written, touching and relevant.""Flipped"" is a cute film for everybody who fondly remembers that fiercely independent girl or the guy with piercing blue eyes that lived across the street.

                ""Flipped"" is superbly directed by Rob Reiner and in my book, one of his best movies. It's a wonderfully told coming-of-age story, which I could relate to in many ways. The main two characters, Juli and Bryce, are very likable. Their parents, played by Penelope Ann Miller and Aidan Quinn, Rebecca de Mornay and Anthony Edwards, respectively, are believable in their roles, which they play excellently. I liked the fact that the story is told from two points of views, Bryce first and then Juli. If you want to see a really feel-good movie, instead of watching some dumb comedy or shoot 'em up flick, go see FLIPPED! You will not regret it.

                I just discovered this gem on Netflix and was impressed, moved and entertained. Its a romantic film about puppy love, so it may not be for everyone (even teens) but I found the leads to be charming and charismatic. The plot device is nothing new, but the charm and early 60's setting make it fresh in many ways. A wonderful cast led by the young leads (now grown!), the late John Mahoney and Aidan Quinn help make this film watchable and enjoyable. A wholesome movie with wonderful moments.

The character development was good, not like many movies which focus on only the main characters.

                Back in 1973, an episode of ""All in the Family"" told the same story from three different perspectives, one of which was from the point of view of Mike ""Meathead"" Stivic, played by Rob Reiner. Watching his latest directorial effort, I wondered if the ""he said / she said"" gimmick of that episode (""Everybody Tells the Truth"") was what attracted Reiner to ""Flipped,"" the young-adult novel by Wendelin Van Draanen, which employs the same multi-POV technique that Lawrence Durrell perfected with his ""Alexandria Quartet"" in the late 1950s. The film version of ""Flipped"" shows Reiner at the top of his form, a worthy addition to an ouevre that includes such classics as ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" ""Misery,"" ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Stand By Me,"" the 1986 period piece that ""Flipped"" most recalls, with its younger characters and coming-of-age theme. At the heart of ""Flipped"" is Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll), a smart, pretty and thoughtful girl who you just can't help losing your heart to. Juli herself flips for Bryce Loski, who is at first repelled by Juli and then slowly starts to see her for the lovely person she is. The cast is augmented by such pros as John Mahoney (Frasier's dad on ""Cheers""), Anthony Edwards, Aidan Quinn and Rebecca De Mornay and Penelope Ann Miller. The film offers up various slices of life from the late '50s and early '60s that makes for a nostalgic, romantic and very moving film. Special kudos to the filmmakers for finding a girl to play young Juli (Morgan Lily) who looks chillingly like Madeline Carroll; I would have bet anything the two were sisters. For those who are bored by the dumb-dumb summer comedies of 2010 (""The Other Guys,"" ""Dinner for Schmucks"") and the special-effects hijinks of ""Inception,"" this is a tender and emotionally satisfying journey that will stay with you for years.

                I really, really liked this film and now wonder why it didn't make more impact when it debuted. Perhaps it was just one of those films that slipped between the cracks because ""Flipped"" is a wonderful coming of age film--and is among director Rob Reiner's best.The film is set mostly in the early 1960s. A young boy, Bryce, moves to a new neighborhood and almost instantly the girl across the street, Juli, begins mooning over him and acting like she's infatuated with him. But he's 7--and hating girls and mushy stuff is normal and he resists her charms. But she persists as the years pass--and she's convinced herself that Bryce is her dream boy. But, as the years pass, Bryce is just as convinced that Juli is a pest. However, eventually, Bryce's attitude starts to change...too bad Juli's is as well!This is a remarkable film in so many ways. The direction is wonderful--perfectly paced and very sweet. The writing is also exceptionally sweet and enchanting. It also helped that there were some wonderful supporting actors to assist in telling the story-- some characters you really liked and cared about and a couple who were complete jerks. John Mahoney was particularly good, but the entire cast was wonderful in this movie. Overall, the elements all work together to tell a sweet story that anyone could love. My only quibble, and it's a very minor one, is about the music. Too many older films are saturated with oldies music. While a bit is nice, with some it sounds more like a best of record album...and at times I would have preferred ""Flipped"" to have been a bit quieter. Not a major complaint by any means and I still give this film a well deserved 9.

                Okay, let's dispense immediately with the idea that this film is geared toward teenagers and all of their sap that they go through. I assure you ""mature adults"" out there that this film will delight you also, unless you are a completely hopelessly lost Scrooge. This film should make sense to all ages. Everyone should identify with it. I don't care what kind of a snob, low-life, big wig, or puritan you are, you should enjoy this film. It's never too sappy when it deals with matters of the heart, nor is it too blunt and insensitive.The film is told almost entirely in a voice over of one of the two main characters. It's told in a brilliant he-said she-said style where the same scene is often told twice from the two opposite points of view (Juli's and Bryce's). So we see the opening scene twice. The first time as explained by Bryce, and the second time explained by Juli. This sort of formula is used many a time in the unfolding battle of the sexes. Of course this doesn't happen in every scene—that would get boring. Director Reiner gives us the proper dosage of everything in this film. The proper amount of comedy, romance, and the proper amount of sadness. Never is it sappy or indulgent or even presumptuous. It's a perfect film for what it's worth. The screenplay is absolutely the work of a fine craftsman—or craftsmen Andrew Scheinman and director Reiner. I don't know how long it took to write or how much blood went into it, but this film is the result of excellent work in every department. The two child stars are perfect in their roles (although Bryce could have done better), but the strength of the cast are in supporting actors. The cast is full of great actors, particularly Anthony Edwards as Bryce's arrogant, critical, smart-Aleck father, and the ever-welcome Aidan Quinn as Juli's loving, down-to-earth, tree painting father.I wasn't completely convinced of the excellence of the film until a beautiful scene in which Mr. Baker (Quinn) and Juli go to visit Mr. Baker's mentally retarded brother Daniel, who is so happy with the world and everything in it. But this scene can't be expressed in words, you have to see it. For what it's worth, Flipped is somewhat of a deep film, full of parallels to the real world. All of the characters have the proper amount of development, even the big sycamore tree that Juli likes to sit in and watch the sunrise. Her exploits while up in that tree are so poetic and beautiful when matched up with the pictures on screen. It's a beautiful and insightful scene into the thoughts and feelings of people in general, not just a teenage girl.In this day when films are almost all big-budget action movies with loud explosions, Flipped has explosions of its own kind. It has explosions of heart and feeling and character, all at the appropriate times. I did not find any ax to grind here. Other than the characters, plot, and screenplay, it's also a technically beautiful film. The camera captures everything so clearly with the proper color timing and excellently framed shots. After the mid-way point of the film, being surrounded by excellence, one starts to look for any reason to criticize the film. I found none. Every nuance of the film is done so genteelly and honestly, who can have a problem with it? This film achieves what movies are meant to achieve. They are meant to reach into are minds and draw us in, to entertain and to move us with fright, emotion, tears, laughs, whatever may be the subject. They are meant to create a world around us, whether in space, in the Wild West, in the future, in Bible times, or in the case of Flipped in 1960s suburbia. This film does exactly what it is meant to do. To touch and make us laugh and to remember. That's what it does. It makes us remember what happened or is happening to us. No one can give this a bad review. I don't see how anyone can pick a fight with the film. But I'm blabbing about nothing.In short, Flipped is by far the best film I've seen this year. I do hope the Academy doesn't overlook this like they do so many other ""family"" films. It should at least get a few nominations, if not a win. We'll see what happens. It's only July.www.colewebbharter.com

                This is a coming of age film set initially and briefly in the late 1950s and mostly in the early 1960s. The boy, Bryce, is chased by his neighbor girl, Juli. And is he chased! Juli is immediately smitten or ""flipped"" by Bryce's eyes and the story unfolds.What is unusual about the story telling is that each major event is played back twice - once through the eyes and voice of Bryce and once through the eyes and voice of Juli. It's the same scene, but you wouldn't know that from their differing viewpoints.Juli is the adventurous and interesting one. Bryce just wants to fit in at their Junior High School. Juli slowly begins to unlike Bryce and Bryce slowly begins to appreciate Juli. Will they ever meet at the same emotional place at the same time? That is the drama and story.The art direction and era are right on. It is the Eisenhower and Kennedy years in look, and even in feel. The wives are subordinate to the husbands. The children are mostly respectful to their parents. And the teachers teach and the students learn. But, you can see the seeds being laid for the rebellious war babies of the late 1960s.Rob Reiner is a talented director for romances - ""When Harry Met Sally."" And he is a talented director for handling young actors - ""Stand By Me."" He combines these talents to help us understand the better part of the human condition; that is, love, respect, sacrifice, forgiveness, and honor. And we have fun and laugh along the way. This is like the TV program, ""Wonder Years"" - but heightened and deepened.-Bob, a Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award Jury Member

                Flipped is a one in a million film - I mean, REALLY one in a million. It's refreshing and lovely, dramatic and hilarious. It does what few films do in our time (or rather what they don't do): Flipped does not sacrifice its integrity for raunchy, gratuitous content. It's real. The emotions are real. The characters are real. And while it certainly isn't G-rated fluff (and do not be fooled - this is not a film for young children), the movie is definitely gentle and innocent in many ways. On the downside, without giving anything away, the ending of the film could have been better patched together, but overall the movie is a cinematic gem like no other. Go see Flipped!

                Juli flipped over Bryce. Bryce's dad flips out. Mom and sister wear their hair in a flip.Charming tale told in a ""he said she said"" often voice-over manner. Interesting enough and short enough so the style doesn't detract. Don't let the print ads mislead you. Bryce never climbs the tree.Excellent performances from the entire cast. Outstanding use of period music. Great collection of shinning '57 Chevy's.Courage, family values, character and nothing explodes. People of every age are treated with respect. What a refreshing movie. Archie Bunker was wrong, Rob Reiner got it right again. He's no meat-head.

                Beautifully told with all the ingredients for a good family movie. The story is told from two different views, the view from the boy and from the girl. A boy who is annoyed by all the attention he gets from the girl across the street. The girl from across the street who has a super crush on the boy tells her part of the story. The boy's father is a man filled with hatred who dispenses politically incorrect lines throughout the movie. The grandfather, the great John Mohoney, is the wise person who tells the boy to really see the girl for what she is, a very special girl. I don't want to give anything away of this jewel of a movie. I enjoyed this movie very much and totally recommend it.

                It's a FANTASTIC one! I have completely fallen in love with it. The puppy love between Julianna and Bryce is so sweet and comedic.What l enjoy Most about the movie is definitely the picturesque countryside it depicts.Yeah,Countryside,along with little Juli and her ""most beautiful"" sycamore tree.I'm always touched by the bucolic and quaint scene where Juli's sitting in her sycamore tree,feeling the gentle breeze blush her cheek and enjoying the majestic and spectacular sunset ,dying the whole sky red.How amazing!It's just the kind of country life l am always yearning for.
Also,I bought this impressive American novel last year,which is as great as the movie.

                A very enjoyable movie, effectively embracing the coming of age sensitivities which come to us all. Although it is clear there are many nuances of other characters which never get dealt with, it's meant to be that way. This is about the kids, the effect they have on one another, their ability and inability to express their feelings, and what can happen when we finally face our fears about the other sex and dare to take a step toward resolving them. The only issue I have is that the film simply has too many anachronisms -- songs not of the period and figures of speech clearly from the present and not the fifties and sixties, but hey, I'm too darn picky about that stuff. Reiner has done it again, offering us a film in the style and tone of Capra. He has crafted a film of sensitivity and grace, and taught us something about life that most of us lose upon becoming adults. Madeline Carroll is simply wonderful as the independent teen taking life head on, and is a true pleasure to watch. She absolutely carries this film.

                Of all the movies I've seen lately, Flipped was amongst the most refreshing. If it had been done by a different director and had different screenwriters, it might be a terrible cliché. Story of first love, known each other since kids, bla bla bla, we've all heard it before.But this movie, it was so pure and so realistic, which is what I love about it most. It wasn't over the top romantic, but it was enough to tug my heartstrings and made me go ""awwww"" instead of going ""ewwww"".The characters felt like real people, and the issues faced in the story felt so real and believable, it made me believe in the basic form of love once more, and that it still existed in real life (even though I know it's just in the movies, but still).Anyway, if you're looking for a story that is refreshing yet vintage, and wanting to have a lovey-dovey grin plastered on your face, then this is the movie to watch.

                Flipped is a sweet, charming, moving, lovely, well-acted coming-of-age romantic drama comedy film.While the plot offers nothing new in particular (as with mostly all rom- com films)...the 'girl meets boy' mixed with 'the not-your-typical girl next door' story, but the storytelling is slightly different. Adapted from the book with the same name by Wendelin Van Draanen, the film is presented in a rather unique 'he-said she-said' style, through the eyes and thoughts of the male lead, Bryce and then again through the eyes and thoughts of female lead, Juli, alternately presenting their views and perspectives on a shared set of events. Nearly every single event that happened in the film is told at least twice, although it seems repetitive, but surprisingly, it never feels boring or annoying. It's actually fascinating and insightful to be able to see into the thoughts and feelings of people in general. Things are not really what it seems and there's always more than meets the eye. As the film progresses, you are so emotionally invested in the characters that you actually begin to eagerly anticipate what the other side of the story might be, how the other person feels the way he/she does. The film also gives a feeling of nostalgia, even for those who never lived in the era (the story is set in 50's or 60's suburban area) or experienced the same events as the two leads. It feels authentic and relatable nonetheless. Juli might appear as an ordinary girl, but she's a sweet, kind, beautiful, daring girl at heart once you get to know her.The two lead stars are perfect in their respective roles. Most of the characters in the film have sufficient character development for the audience to understand them. Flipped is a period young love story, told in a simple and heartfelt manner. A rare cinematic gem.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/shorter-movie-review-flipped.html Rating: 8/10""A painting is more than the sum of its parts. A cow by itself is just a cow.

                Flipped is a coming of age film directed by the coming of age master director Rob Reiner. Reiner directed the tear-jerker Stand By Me and is now back to bring Wendelin Van Draanen's novel of the same name to life. What a treat! Flipped and Stand By Me both make me wish my childhood was full of more adventure and fun rather than just me sitting on the computer writing review after review aspiring to be a critic. I get tears in my eyes to both films because I become so attached to the characters and they're living the life I can only dream to have. With the exception of unfaithful parents when it comes to Stand By Me.What came to mind halfway through the film was why couldn't the movie Speak have been this good? This film proves more than 80% can be done by narration from TWO characters different perspective and it can be done well. Why not do the same for Speak? Most of the dialog in this film is internal and not directly word of mouth and it works. Why not treat Speak the same way? Were they afraid they would mess it up? It begs an explanation to why Laurie Halse Anderson's novel's potential on film was unfaithful to it's film companion.Never reading the book, I do know that it was set in the nineties and the two thousands while this film's setting is in the late fifties and early sixties. It's not that big of a deal with the drastic setting change, but maybe I would've been more upset if I was a huge fan of the book to find out the film was set four years in the past.The movie about Bryce Loski (McAuliffe), a kid who moves into the neighborhood at a young age to immediately become eye candy to his new neighbor Juli Baker (Carroll). Bryce is resistant, while Juli is persistent. She is positive Bryce will give her her first kiss and believes Bryce is just a little shy, when really he wants nothing to do with her. Juli continues up until present day middle school to give Bryce the chance to admit his ""feelings"" for her but doesn't.Juli lives across the street from Bryce and her yard is an eyesore. It's paid for by the landlord since most of the money Juli and her family makes is given to Juli's father's mentally challenged brother. Bryce's family, his dad mostly, is annoyed by Juli and her family's crappy yard and continue to bad mouth and make assumptions about the Baker family when they really have no idea what it's like over there.The film is narrated by both leads more often than not. Usually we'll get five minutes or so of Bryce narrating his side of the story, while Juli narrates her's. It's almost an anthology because we see what goes on from Bryce's standpoint while hearing his thoughts at the moment and then we see what happened prior or after the events of Bryce's because we then go to Juli. It's confusing. But it works all the time.At the beginning of the film I thought the narrations were only used for the audience to get affiliated with the lives of the characters and what happened before we got here. We spend ninety minutes or longer with movie characters and some films don't even give you the damn courtesy to provide us with any kind of background information. We are supposed to just be thrown into a film with characters we sometimes don't even find out the last names to.The one minor problem I have with the film is the end. It leaves off on the wrong note. The film is only ninety minutes when it could and should be longer. The place they ended was fine, but the scenes on the DVD cover and poster never occur in the film. What a letdown.Flipped is 2010's underrated masterpiece and it definitely showcases a worthy coming of age film. It's smooth style of directing, great music, calm feeling even at it's most stressful, and strong leads are more than I could've asked for. Rob Reiner is something else. A true talent in the movie business. Especially when making a movie as heartfelt as this one.Starring: Callan McAuliffe, Madeline Carroll, Rebecca De Mornay, Anthony Edwards, John Mahoney, Penelope Ann Miller, Aidan Quinn, and Kevin Weisman. Directed by: Rob Reiner.

                With a technique borrowed from Casino of the story being told from two different protagonist points of view, Rob Reiner gives us a wonderful family film about first love. Flipped is a lot less bloody and a great deal sweeter than Martin Scorsese's gangster classic.The prosperous Loski family moves into the neighborhood where the ne'er do well Bakers live. On that day in the late fifties the kids that grow up to be Callan McAuliffe and Madeline Carroll set eyes on each other. Carroll thinks McAuliffe is the one, but such decisions at the age of 7 are sometimes reconsidered. And McAuliffe can't see her for beans, she's just an annoying girl which is not atypical for the second grade.Moving into junior high school is a different matter. With the onset of puberty both these kids are experiencing conflicting emotions. McAuliffe acts like a jerk sometimes, Carroll expects a bit much.The families are different. Anthony Edwards who is McAuliffe's dad is a bit of a fathead and has a thing about his neighbor's lifestyle. Their yard contains a chicken coop and is not in good shape and it's bringing down the values of the other property on the block. As for Aidan Quinn who is Carroll's dad and his family lives as it does in order to support his brother who lives in a sanitarium, an expensive private one for the mentally retarded. Quinn is a wonderful dad, but the Bakers live a whole lot like the Micawbers waiting for something to turn up.The women are wiser than the men, Rebecca DeMornay and Penelope Ann Miller the wives of Edwards and Quinn respectively bond. McAuliffe also has the wisdom of his maternal grandfather John Mahoney to lean on. He's a surrogate grandfather to Carroll as well.Rob Reiner came up with a real winner. The kids act like real kids as opposed to Hollywood kids. The grownups are neither all wise Deities or complete idiots. The women young and old do come out better than the men. I think everyone is going to like this one.Flipped is highly rated for family viewing.

                ""All I ever wanted was for Juli Baker to leave me alone.""Flipped is easily the best love story/relationship movie I've seen since (500) Days of Summer. I'm the kind of guy that you couldn't pay to watch a Nicholas Sparks movie, but that doesn't mean that I can't appreciate a good movie about the highs and lows of love. In a year of formulaic, mind-numbing flicks with no imagination or heart like Letters to Juliet, Flipped is a welcome breath of fresh air. It's about 8 or so years in the lives of two kids who meet when when one of them moves into a new neighborhood. Juli (played by Morgan Lily and Madeline Carroll) is instantly smitten by Bryce (Ryan Ketzner and Callan McAuliffe) the second she sees him drive up to his new house. Bryce, being a typical second grade boy, finds her attention embarrassing and unwanted. As they get older, that dynamic between them remains pretty much the same, but we wouldn't have a very interesting movie if that's all there was to it. Eventually Bryce finds himself on the other side of the equation (flipped, get it?), and has to win back the girl he never knew he always wanted.How odd is it that a movie about a couple of kids handles the topic of love in a more mature and genuine way than almost all of the adult-oriented romantic comedies that we're buried under each year? There's no doubt about it that Flipped will make you say ""aww"" on occasion, but there's a lot more to it than just kids being cute. Humor, issues of class, family conflict, and the lost idealism of youth are introduced into the story by Bryce and Juli's respective families, and there are several outright bittersweet or poignant scenes within the story.The movie is shown from the POV's of both main characters, and often the same event will be shown from each of their perspectives. It works really well, as it really helps the viewer to ""get"" both Bryce and Juli. The kids chosen to play the older versions of the two (Carroll and McAuliffe) are both great, the fact that the story is set in 50's or 60's suburbia adds a believable sense of innocence to it all, and there is just a fresh feeling to the movie that I can't really describe with words.I heartily recommend this to anyone who likes a good, well-written movie, regardless of the genre. You can tell that a lot of heart went into making Flipped, and it shows. Great movie.

                'Flipped' is truly a ""real movie"". Probably what most people enjoyed about this movie was that the events that happened in the movie could might as well have been their reality. Many people in this world (if not all) have experienced having a real crush. This movie shows a crush blossoming from both a guy's and a girl's view. It was very interesting to see two viewpoints on this everyday happening. That is what makes this movie so appealing. Viewers get to watch Bryce and Juli's emotions whenever they see the other. Viewers see Bryce and Juli's smiles that they can't help. Viewers get to know who exactly Bryce and Juli are.Anyone and everyone will enjoy this movie or can at least, relate to it. Even adults! This film will surely take you down memory lane and help you remember the feelings you had when you were first in love. I've never experienced being in love before, but this film makes it seem wonderful. I absolutely loved this film.Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe were great in this film! Even if they're very young, they did wonderful jobs in performing here. In each of their scenes, you could sense the emotions that they were feeling and wanted to convey to the viewers. The characters themselves were also very interesting. Particularly Ms. Juli Baker. It was nice to see such a free-spirited teenager, who was very opinionated and didn't let anything stand in her way. The chemistry that both actors had were average. I thought that they showed their most potential when acting by themselves, in their own surroundings.I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that Rob Reiner, the director of this film, was the same person who directed 'When Harry Met Sally' and 'Sleepless in Seattle'. So far, all romantic-comedies that Rob Reiner has directed has not disappointed me. I can't wait for more of his works! All his rom-coms are excellent additions to the romance movie genre.This was an amazing teenage romantic comedy. Surely one of my favorites, right up there with 'When Harry Met Sally'. Do not miss this film. It's baffling to see that this film isn't as popular as it's supposed to be.Viewed on: April 5, 2011 ; December 16, 2011

                Juli just had to take one look at Bryce's blue eyes, and she knew it was true love. Bryce just had to take one notice of Juli's manic desperation, and he knew it was going to be a friendship of torment. I just had to take one look at the film's artfully designed poster, and I knew ""Flipped"" was a film to be savoured.A beautifully told film of first love, we flip from Juli's point of view to Bryce's point of view, very effectively giving us the true nature of their friendship, love and respect they have for each other. Except in the case of middle-school graders, that love and respect can frequently look like embarrassment, mistrust, and shame. All of those emotions are told with intelligence, subtlety and humour.""Flipped"" has all of the comedy, naiveté and bewilderment of first love. It takes the romantic comedy farther by actually giving us characters with real depth. There is more going on than just Juli and Bryce figuring out their love for each other, and every aspect of this film is well written, touching and relevant.""Flipped"" is a cute film for everybody who fondly remembers that fiercely independent girl or the guy with piercing blue eyes that lived across the street.

","
                ""Flipped"" is superbly directed by Rob Reiner and in my book, one of his best movies. It's a wonderfully told coming-of-age story, which I could relate to in many ways. The main two characters, Juli and Bryce, are very likable. Their parents, played by Penelope Ann Miller and Aidan Quinn, Rebecca de Mornay and Anthony Edwards, respectively, are believable in their roles, which they play excellently. I liked the fact that the story is told from two points of views, Bryce first and then Juli. If you want to see a really feel-good movie, instead of watching some dumb comedy or shoot 'em up flick, go see FLIPPED! You will not regret it.

                I just discovered this gem on Netflix and was impressed, moved and entertained. Its a romantic film about puppy love, so it may not be for everyone (even teens) but I found the leads to be charming and charismatic. The plot device is nothing new, but the charm and early 60's setting make it fresh in many ways. A wonderful cast led by the young leads (now grown!), the late John Mahoney and Aidan Quinn help make this film watchable and enjoyable. A wholesome movie with wonderful moments.

                The first few minutes sent me back a decade reminding how much we avoided girls or getting our names attached to one..I really liked how the story showed a basic fact (mostly at least) :""The one you love doesn't love you back, and you don't love the one that loves you!""Though the main story is not that all can relate to, the background or the base of the story was really nice. The character development was good, not like many movies which focus on only the main characters. Though the story was a little predictable, the movie is enjoyable and among a few to which we can relate to.This movie is definitely worth a watch.And it deserves an 8 out of 10.

","
                Back in 1973, an episode of ""All in the Family"" told the same story from three different perspectives, one of which was from the point of view of Mike ""Meathead"" Stivic, played by Rob Reiner. Watching his latest directorial effort, I wondered if the ""he said / she said"" gimmick of that episode (""Everybody Tells the Truth"") was what attracted Reiner to ""Flipped,"" the young-adult novel by Wendelin Van Draanen, which employs the same multi-POV technique that Lawrence Durrell perfected with his ""Alexandria Quartet"" in the late 1950s. The film version of ""Flipped"" shows Reiner at the top of his form, a worthy addition to an ouevre that includes such classics as ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" ""Misery,"" ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Stand By Me,"" the 1986 period piece that ""Flipped"" most recalls, with its younger characters and coming-of-age theme. At the heart of ""Flipped"" is Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll), a smart, pretty and thoughtful girl who you just can't help losing your heart to. Juli herself flips for Bryce Loski, who is at first repelled by Juli and then slowly starts to see her for the lovely person she is. The cast is augmented by such pros as John Mahoney (Frasier's dad on ""Cheers""), Anthony Edwards, Aidan Quinn and Rebecca De Mornay and Penelope Ann Miller. The film offers up various slices of life from the late '50s and early '60s that makes for a nostalgic, romantic and very moving film. Special kudos to the filmmakers for finding a girl to play young Juli (Morgan Lily) who looks chillingly like Madeline Carroll; I would have bet anything the two were sisters. For those who are bored by the dumb-dumb summer comedies of 2010 (""The Other Guys,"" ""Dinner for Schmucks"") and the special-effects hijinks of ""Inception,"" this is a tender and emotionally satisfying journey that will stay with you for years.

                I really, really liked this film and now wonder why it didn't make more impact when it debuted. Perhaps it was just one of those films that slipped between the cracks because ""Flipped"" is a wonderful coming of age film--and is among director Rob Reiner's best.The film is set mostly in the early 1960s. A young boy, Bryce, moves to a new neighborhood and almost instantly the girl across the street, Juli, begins mooning over him and acting like she's infatuated with him. But he's 7--and hating girls and mushy stuff is normal and he resists her charms. But she persists as the years pass--and she's convinced herself that Bryce is her dream boy. But, as the years pass, Bryce is just as convinced that Juli is a pest. However, eventually, Bryce's attitude starts to change...too bad Juli's is as well!This is a remarkable film in so many ways. The direction is wonderful--perfectly paced and very sweet. The writing is also exceptionally sweet and enchanting. It also helped that there were some wonderful supporting actors to assist in telling the story-- some characters you really liked and cared about and a couple who were complete jerks. John Mahoney was particularly good, but the entire cast was wonderful in this movie. Overall, the elements all work together to tell a sweet story that anyone could love. My only quibble, and it's a very minor one, is about the music. Too many older films are saturated with oldies music. While a bit is nice, with some it sounds more like a best of record album...and at times I would have preferred ""Flipped"" to have been a bit quieter. Not a major complaint by any means and I still give this film a well deserved 9.

                Okay, let's dispense immediately with the idea that this film is geared toward teenagers and all of their sap that they go through. I assure you ""mature adults"" out there that this film will delight you also, unless you are a completely hopelessly lost Scrooge. This film should make sense to all ages. Everyone should identify with it. I don't care what kind of a snob, low-life, big wig, or puritan you are, you should enjoy this film. It's never too sappy when it deals with matters of the heart, nor is it too blunt and insensitive.The film is told almost entirely in a voice over of one of the two main characters. It's told in a brilliant he-said she-said style where the same scene is often told twice from the two opposite points of view (Juli's and Bryce's). So we see the opening scene twice. The first time as explained by Bryce, and the second time explained by Juli. This sort of formula is used many a time in the unfolding battle of the sexes. Of course this doesn't happen in every scene—that would get boring. Director Reiner gives us the proper dosage of everything in this film. The proper amount of comedy, romance, and the proper amount of sadness. Never is it sappy or indulgent or even presumptuous. It's a perfect film for what it's worth. The screenplay is absolutely the work of a fine craftsman—or craftsmen Andrew Scheinman and director Reiner. I don't know how long it took to write or how much blood went into it, but this film is the result of excellent work in every department. The two child stars are perfect in their roles (although Bryce could have done better), but the strength of the cast are in supporting actors. The cast is full of great actors, particularly Anthony Edwards as Bryce's arrogant, critical, smart-Aleck father, and the ever-welcome Aidan Quinn as Juli's loving, down-to-earth, tree painting father.I wasn't completely convinced of the excellence of the film until a beautiful scene in which Mr. Baker (Quinn) and Juli go to visit Mr. Baker's mentally retarded brother Daniel, who is so happy with the world and everything in it. But this scene can't be expressed in words, you have to see it. For what it's worth, Flipped is somewhat of a deep film, full of parallels to the real world. All of the characters have the proper amount of development, even the big sycamore tree that Juli likes to sit in and watch the sunrise. Her exploits while up in that tree are so poetic and beautiful when matched up with the pictures on screen. It's a beautiful and insightful scene into the thoughts and feelings of people in general, not just a teenage girl.In this day when films are almost all big-budget action movies with loud explosions, Flipped has explosions of its own kind. It has explosions of heart and feeling and character, all at the appropriate times. I did not find any ax to grind here. Other than the characters, plot, and screenplay, it's also a technically beautiful film. The camera captures everything so clearly with the proper color timing and excellently framed shots. After the mid-way point of the film, being surrounded by excellence, one starts to look for any reason to criticize the film. I found none. Every nuance of the film is done so genteelly and honestly, who can have a problem with it? This film achieves what movies are meant to achieve. They are meant to reach into are minds and draw us in, to entertain and to move us with fright, emotion, tears, laughs, whatever may be the subject. They are meant to create a world around us, whether in space, in the Wild West, in the future, in Bible times, or in the case of Flipped in 1960s suburbia. This film does exactly what it is meant to do. To touch and make us laugh and to remember. That's what it does. It makes us remember what happened or is happening to us. No one can give this a bad review. I don't see how anyone can pick a fight with the film. But I'm blabbing about nothing.In short, Flipped is by far the best film I've seen this year. I do hope the Academy doesn't overlook this like they do so many other ""family"" films. It should at least get a few nominations, if not a win. We'll see what happens. It's only July.www.colewebbharter.com

                This is a coming of age film set initially and briefly in the late 1950s and mostly in the early 1960s. The boy, Bryce, is chased by his neighbor girl, Juli. And is he chased! Juli is immediately smitten or ""flipped"" by Bryce's eyes and the story unfolds.What is unusual about the story telling is that each major event is played back twice - once through the eyes and voice of Bryce and once through the eyes and voice of Juli. It's the same scene, but you wouldn't know that from their differing viewpoints.Juli is the adventurous and interesting one. Bryce just wants to fit in at their Junior High School. Juli slowly begins to unlike Bryce and Bryce slowly begins to appreciate Juli. Will they ever meet at the same emotional place at the same time? That is the drama and story.The art direction and era are right on. It is the Eisenhower and Kennedy years in look, and even in feel. The wives are subordinate to the husbands. The children are mostly respectful to their parents. And the teachers teach and the students learn. But, you can see the seeds being laid for the rebellious war babies of the late 1960s.Rob Reiner is a talented director for romances - ""When Harry Met Sally."" And he is a talented director for handling young actors - ""Stand By Me."" He combines these talents to help us understand the better part of the human condition; that is, love, respect, sacrifice, forgiveness, and honor. And we have fun and laugh along the way. This is like the TV program, ""Wonder Years"" - but heightened and deepened.-Bob, a Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award Jury Member

                Flipped is a one in a million film - I mean, REALLY one in a million. It's refreshing and lovely, dramatic and hilarious. It does what few films do in our time (or rather what they don't do): Flipped does not sacrifice its integrity for raunchy, gratuitous content. It's real. The emotions are real. The characters are real. And while it certainly isn't G-rated fluff (and do not be fooled - this is not a film for young children), the movie is definitely gentle and innocent in many ways. On the downside, without giving anything away, the ending of the film could have been better patched together, but overall the movie is a cinematic gem like no other. Go see Flipped!

Interesting enough and short enough so the style doesn't detract. Don't let the print ads mislead you. Bryce never climbs the tree.Excellent performances from the entire cast. Outstanding use of period music. Great collection of shinning '57 Chevy's.Courage, family values, character and nothing explodes. People of every age are treated with respect. What a refreshing movie. Archie Bunker was wrong, Rob Reiner got it right again. He's no meat-head.

                Beautifully told with all the ingredients for a good family movie. The story is told from two different views, the view from the boy and from the girl. A boy who is annoyed by all the attention he gets from the girl across the street. The girl from across the street who has a super crush on the boy tells her part of the story. The boy's father is a man filled with hatred who dispenses politically incorrect lines throughout the movie. The grandfather, the great John Mohoney, is the wise person who tells the boy to really see the girl for what she is, a very special girl. I don't want to give anything away of this jewel of a movie. I enjoyed this movie very much and totally recommend it.

                It's a FANTASTIC one! I have completely fallen in love with it. The puppy love between Julianna and Bryce is so sweet and comedic.What l enjoy Most about the movie is definitely the picturesque countryside it depicts.Yeah,Countryside,along with little Juli and her ""most beautiful"" sycamore tree.I'm always touched by the bucolic and quaint scene where Juli's sitting in her sycamore tree,feeling the gentle breeze blush her cheek and enjoying the majestic and spectacular sunset ,dying the whole sky red.How amazing!It's just the kind of country life l am always yearning for.
Also,I bought this impressive American novel last year,which is as great as the movie.

                A very enjoyable movie, effectively embracing the coming of age sensitivities which come to us all. Although it is clear there are many nuances of other characters which never get dealt with, it's meant to be that way. This is about the kids, the effect they have on one another, their ability and inability to express their feelings, and what can happen when we finally face our fears about the other sex and dare to take a step toward resolving them. The only issue I have is that the film simply has too many anachronisms -- songs not of the period and figures of speech clearly from the present and not the fifties and sixties, but hey, I'm too darn picky about that stuff. Reiner has done it again, offering us a film in the style and tone of Capra. He has crafted a film of sensitivity and grace, and taught us something about life that most of us lose upon becoming adults. Madeline Carroll is simply wonderful as the independent teen taking life head on, and is a true pleasure to watch. She absolutely carries this film.

                Of all the movies I've seen lately, Flipped was amongst the most refreshing. If it had been done by a different director and had different screenwriters, it might be a terrible cliché. Story of first love, known each other since kids, bla bla bla, we've all heard it before.But this movie, it was so pure and so realistic, which is what I love about it most. It wasn't over the top romantic, but it was enough to tug my heartstrings and made me go ""awwww"" instead of going ""ewwww"".The characters felt like real people, and the issues faced in the story felt so real and believable, it made me believe in the basic form of love once more, and that it still existed in real life (even though I know it's just in the movies, but still).Anyway, if you're looking for a story that is refreshing yet vintage, and wanting to have a lovey-dovey grin plastered on your face, then this is the movie to watch.

                Flipped is a sweet, charming, moving, lovely, well-acted coming-of-age romantic drama comedy film.While the plot offers nothing new in particular (as with mostly all rom- com films)...the 'girl meets boy' mixed with 'the not-your-typical girl next door' story, but the storytelling is slightly different. Adapted from the book with the same name by Wendelin Van Draanen, the film is presented in a rather unique 'he-said she-said' style, through the eyes and thoughts of the male lead, Bryce and then again through the eyes and thoughts of female lead, Juli, alternately presenting their views and perspectives on a shared set of events. Nearly every single event that happened in the film is told at least twice, although it seems repetitive, but surprisingly, it never feels boring or annoying. It's actually fascinating and insightful to be able to see into the thoughts and feelings of people in general. Things are not really what it seems and there's always more than meets the eye. As the film progresses, you are so emotionally invested in the characters that you actually begin to eagerly anticipate what the other side of the story might be, how the other person feels the way he/she does. The film also gives a feeling of nostalgia, even for those who never lived in the era (the story is set in 50's or 60's suburban area) or experienced the same events as the two leads. It feels authentic and relatable nonetheless. Juli might appear as an ordinary girl, but she's a sweet, kind, beautiful, daring girl at heart once you get to know her.The two lead stars are perfect in their respective roles. Most of the characters in the film have sufficient character development for the audience to understand them. Flipped is a period young love story, told in a simple and heartfelt manner. A rare cinematic gem.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/shorter-movie-review-flipped.html Rating: 8/10""A painting is more than the sum of its parts. A cow by itself is just a cow.

                Flipped is a coming of age film directed by the coming of age master director Rob Reiner. Reiner directed the tear-jerker Stand By Me and is now back to bring Wendelin Van Draanen's novel of the same name to life. What a treat! Flipped and Stand By Me both make me wish my childhood was full of more adventure and fun rather than just me sitting on the computer writing review after review aspiring to be a critic. I get tears in my eyes to both films because I become so attached to the characters and they're living the life I can only dream to have. With the exception of unfaithful parents when it comes to Stand By Me.What came to mind halfway through the film was why couldn't the movie Speak have been this good? This film proves more than 80% can be done by narration from TWO characters different perspective and it can be done well. Why not do the same for Speak? Most of the dialog in this film is internal and not directly word of mouth and it works. Why not treat Speak the same way? Were they afraid they would mess it up? It begs an explanation to why Laurie Halse Anderson's novel's potential on film was unfaithful to it's film companion.Never reading the book, I do know that it was set in the nineties and the two thousands while this film's setting is in the late fifties and early sixties. It's not that big of a deal with the drastic setting change, but maybe I would've been more upset if I was a huge fan of the book to find out the film was set four years in the past.The movie about Bryce Loski (McAuliffe), a kid who moves into the neighborhood at a young age to immediately become eye candy to his new neighbor Juli Baker (Carroll). Bryce is resistant, while Juli is persistent. She is positive Bryce will give her her first kiss and believes Bryce is just a little shy, when really he wants nothing to do with her. Juli continues up until present day middle school to give Bryce the chance to admit his ""feelings"" for her but doesn't.Juli lives across the street from Bryce and her yard is an eyesore. It's paid for by the landlord since most of the money Juli and her family makes is given to Juli's father's mentally challenged brother. Bryce's family, his dad mostly, is annoyed by Juli and her family's crappy yard and continue to bad mouth and make assumptions about the Baker family when they really have no idea what it's like over there.The film is narrated by both leads more often than not. Usually we'll get five minutes or so of Bryce narrating his side of the story, while Juli narrates her's. It's almost an anthology because we see what goes on from Bryce's standpoint while hearing his thoughts at the moment and then we see what happened prior or after the events of Bryce's because we then go to Juli. It's confusing. But it works all the time.At the beginning of the film I thought the narrations were only used for the audience to get affiliated with the lives of the characters and what happened before we got here. We spend ninety minutes or longer with movie characters and some films don't even give you the damn courtesy to provide us with any kind of background information. We are supposed to just be thrown into a film with characters we sometimes don't even find out the last names to.The one minor problem I have with the film is the end. It leaves off on the wrong note. The film is only ninety minutes when it could and should be longer. The place they ended was fine, but the scenes on the DVD cover and poster never occur in the film. What a letdown.Flipped is 2010's underrated masterpiece and it definitely showcases a worthy coming of age film. It's smooth style of directing, great music, calm feeling even at it's most stressful, and strong leads are more than I could've asked for. Rob Reiner is something else. A true talent in the movie business. Especially when making a movie as heartfelt as this one.Starring: Callan McAuliffe, Madeline Carroll, Rebecca De Mornay, Anthony Edwards, John Mahoney, Penelope Ann Miller, Aidan Quinn, and Kevin Weisman. Directed by: Rob Reiner.

                With a technique borrowed from Casino of the story being told from two different protagonist points of view, Rob Reiner gives us a wonderful family film about first love. Flipped is a lot less bloody and a great deal sweeter than Martin Scorsese's gangster classic.The prosperous Loski family moves into the neighborhood where the ne'er do well Bakers live. On that day in the late fifties the kids that grow up to be Callan McAuliffe and Madeline Carroll set eyes on each other. Carroll thinks McAuliffe is the one, but such decisions at the age of 7 are sometimes reconsidered. And McAuliffe can't see her for beans, she's just an annoying girl which is not atypical for the second grade.Moving into junior high school is a different matter. With the onset of puberty both these kids are experiencing conflicting emotions. McAuliffe acts like a jerk sometimes, Carroll expects a bit much.The families are different. Anthony Edwards who is McAuliffe's dad is a bit of a fathead and has a thing about his neighbor's lifestyle. Their yard contains a chicken coop and is not in good shape and it's bringing down the values of the other property on the block. As for Aidan Quinn who is Carroll's dad and his family lives as it does in order to support his brother who lives in a sanitarium, an expensive private one for the mentally retarded. Quinn is a wonderful dad, but the Bakers live a whole lot like the Micawbers waiting for something to turn up.The women are wiser than the men, Rebecca DeMornay and Penelope Ann Miller the wives of Edwards and Quinn respectively bond. McAuliffe also has the wisdom of his maternal grandfather John Mahoney to lean on. He's a surrogate grandfather to Carroll as well.Rob Reiner came up with a real winner. The kids act like real kids as opposed to Hollywood kids. The grownups are neither all wise Deities or complete idiots. The women young and old do come out better than the men. I think everyone is going to like this one.Flipped is highly rated for family viewing.

                ""All I ever wanted was for Juli Baker to leave me alone.""Flipped is easily the best love story/relationship movie I've seen since (500) Days of Summer. I'm the kind of guy that you couldn't pay to watch a Nicholas Sparks movie, but that doesn't mean that I can't appreciate a good movie about the highs and lows of love. In a year of formulaic, mind-numbing flicks with no imagination or heart like Letters to Juliet, Flipped is a welcome breath of fresh air. It's about 8 or so years in the lives of two kids who meet when when one of them moves into a new neighborhood. Juli (played by Morgan Lily and Madeline Carroll) is instantly smitten by Bryce (Ryan Ketzner and Callan McAuliffe) the second she sees him drive up to his new house. Bryce, being a typical second grade boy, finds her attention embarrassing and unwanted. As they get older, that dynamic between them remains pretty much the same, but we wouldn't have a very interesting movie if that's all there was to it. Eventually Bryce finds himself on the other side of the equation (flipped, get it?), and has to win back the girl he never knew he always wanted.How odd is it that a movie about a couple of kids handles the topic of love in a more mature and genuine way than almost all of the adult-oriented romantic comedies that we're buried under each year? There's no doubt about it that Flipped will make you say ""aww"" on occasion, but there's a lot more to it than just kids being cute. Humor, issues of class, family conflict, and the lost idealism of youth are introduced into the story by Bryce and Juli's respective families, and there are several outright bittersweet or poignant scenes within the story.The movie is shown from the POV's of both main characters, and often the same event will be shown from each of their perspectives. It works really well, as it really helps the viewer to ""get"" both Bryce and Juli. The kids chosen to play the older versions of the two (Carroll and McAuliffe) are both great, the fact that the story is set in 50's or 60's suburbia adds a believable sense of innocence to it all, and there is just a fresh feeling to the movie that I can't really describe with words.I heartily recommend this to anyone who likes a good, well-written movie, regardless of the genre. You can tell that a lot of heart went into making Flipped, and it shows. Great movie.

                'Flipped' is truly a ""real movie"". Probably what most people enjoyed about this movie was that the events that happened in the movie could might as well have been their reality. Many people in this world (if not all) have experienced having a real crush. This movie shows a crush blossoming from both a guy's and a girl's view. It was very interesting to see two viewpoints on this everyday happening. That is what makes this movie so appealing. Viewers get to watch Bryce and Juli's emotions whenever they see the other. Viewers see Bryce and Juli's smiles that they can't help. Viewers get to know who exactly Bryce and Juli are.Anyone and everyone will enjoy this movie or can at least, relate to it. Even adults! This film will surely take you down memory lane and help you remember the feelings you had when you were first in love. I've never experienced being in love before, but this film makes it seem wonderful. I absolutely loved this film.Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe were great in this film! Even if they're very young, they did wonderful jobs in performing here. In each of their scenes, you could sense the emotions that they were feeling and wanted to convey to the viewers. The characters themselves were also very interesting. Particularly Ms. Juli Baker. It was nice to see such a free-spirited teenager, who was very opinionated and didn't let anything stand in her way. The chemistry that both actors had were average. I thought that they showed their most potential when acting by themselves, in their own surroundings.I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that Rob Reiner, the director of this film, was the same person who directed 'When Harry Met Sally' and 'Sleepless in Seattle'. So far, all romantic-comedies that Rob Reiner has directed has not disappointed me. I can't wait for more of his works! All his rom-coms are excellent additions to the romance movie genre.This was an amazing teenage romantic comedy. Surely one of my favorites, right up there with 'When Harry Met Sally'. Do not miss this film. It's baffling to see that this film isn't as popular as it's supposed to be.Viewed on: April 5, 2011 ; December 16, 2011

                Juli just had to take one look at Bryce's blue eyes, and she knew it was true love. Bryce just had to take one notice of Juli's manic desperation, and he knew it was going to be a friendship of torment. I just had to take one look at the film's artfully designed poster, and I knew ""Flipped"" was a film to be savoured.A beautifully told film of first love, we flip from Juli's point of view to Bryce's point of view, very effectively giving us the true nature of their friendship, love and respect they have for each other. Except in the case of middle-school graders, that love and respect can frequently look like embarrassment, mistrust, and shame. All of those emotions are told with intelligence, subtlety and humour.""Flipped"" has all of the comedy, naiveté and bewilderment of first love. It takes the romantic comedy farther by actually giving us characters with real depth. There is more going on than just Juli and Bryce figuring out their love for each other, and every aspect of this film is well written, touching and relevant.""Flipped"" is a cute film for everybody who fondly remembers that fiercely independent girl or the guy with piercing blue eyes that lived across the street.

","
                ""Flipped"" is superbly directed by Rob Reiner and in my book, one of his best movies. It's a wonderfully told coming-of-age story, which I could relate to in many ways. The main two characters, Juli and Bryce, are very likable. Their parents, played by Penelope Ann Miller and Aidan Quinn, Rebecca de Mornay and Anthony Edwards, respectively, are believable in their roles, which they play excellently. I liked the fact that the story is told from two points of views, Bryce first and then Juli. If you want to see a really feel-good movie, instead of watching some dumb comedy or shoot 'em up flick, go see FLIPPED! You will not regret it.

                I just discovered this gem on Netflix and was impressed, moved and entertained. Its a romantic film about puppy love, so it may not be for everyone (even teens) but I found the leads to be charming and charismatic. The plot device is nothing new, but the charm and early 60's setting make it fresh in many ways. A wonderful cast led by the young leads (now grown!), the late John Mahoney and Aidan Quinn help make this film watchable and enjoyable. A wholesome movie with wonderful moments.

                The first few minutes sent me back a decade reminding how much we avoided girls or getting our names attached to one..I really liked how the story showed a basic fact (mostly at least) :""The one you love doesn't love you back, and you don't love the one that loves you!""Though the main story is not that all can relate to, the background or the base of the story was really nice. The character development was good, not like many movies which focus on only the main characters. Though the story was a little predictable, the movie is enjoyable and among a few to which we can relate to.This movie is definitely worth a watch.And it deserves an 8 out of 10.

","
                Back in 1973, an episode of ""All in the Family"" told the same story from three different perspectives, one of which was from the point of view of Mike ""Meathead"" Stivic, played by Rob Reiner. Watching his latest directorial effort, I wondered if the ""he said / she said"" gimmick of that episode (""Everybody Tells the Truth"") was what attracted Reiner to ""Flipped,"" the young-adult novel by Wendelin Van Draanen, which employs the same multi-POV technique that Lawrence Durrell perfected with his ""Alexandria Quartet"" in the late 1950s. The film version of ""Flipped"" shows Reiner at the top of his form, a worthy addition to an ouevre that includes such classics as ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" ""Misery,"" ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Stand By Me,"" the 1986 period piece that ""Flipped"" most recalls, with its younger characters and coming-of-age theme. At the heart of ""Flipped"" is Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll), a smart, pretty and thoughtful girl who you just can't help losing your heart to. Juli herself flips for Bryce Loski, who is at first repelled by Juli and then slowly starts to see her for the lovely person she is. The cast is augmented by such pros as John Mahoney (Frasier's dad on ""Cheers""), Anthony Edwards, Aidan Quinn and Rebecca De Mornay and Penelope Ann Miller. The film offers up various slices of life from the late '50s and early '60s that makes for a nostalgic, romantic and very moving film. Special kudos to the filmmakers for finding a girl to play young Juli (Morgan Lily) who looks chillingly like Madeline Carroll; I would have bet anything the two were sisters. For those who are bored by the dumb-dumb summer comedies of 2010 (""The Other Guys,"" ""Dinner for Schmucks"") and the special-effects hijinks of ""Inception,"" this is a tender and emotionally satisfying journey that will stay with you for years.

                I really, really liked this film and now wonder why it didn't make more impact when it debuted. Perhaps it was just one of those films that slipped between the cracks because ""Flipped"" is a wonderful coming of age film--and is among director Rob Reiner's best.The film is set mostly in the early 1960s. A young boy, Bryce, moves to a new neighborhood and almost instantly the girl across the street, Juli, begins mooning over him and acting like she's infatuated with him. But he's 7--and hating girls and mushy stuff is normal and he resists her charms. But she persists as the years pass--and she's convinced herself that Bryce is her dream boy. But, as the years pass, Bryce is just as convinced that Juli is a pest. However, eventually, Bryce's attitude starts to change...too bad Juli's is as well!This is a remarkable film in so many ways. The direction is wonderful--perfectly paced and very sweet. The writing is also exceptionally sweet and enchanting. It also helped that there were some wonderful supporting actors to assist in telling the story-- some characters you really liked and cared about and a couple who were complete jerks. John Mahoney was particularly good, but the entire cast was wonderful in this movie. Overall, the elements all work together to tell a sweet story that anyone could love. My only quibble, and it's a very minor one, is about the music. Too many older films are saturated with oldies music. While a bit is nice, with some it sounds more like a best of record album...and at times I would have preferred ""Flipped"" to have been a bit quieter. Not a major complaint by any means and I still give this film a well deserved 9.

                Okay, let's dispense immediately with the idea that this film is geared toward teenagers and all of their sap that they go through. I assure you ""mature adults"" out there that this film will delight you also, unless you are a completely hopelessly lost Scrooge. This film should make sense to all ages. Everyone should identify with it. I don't care what kind of a snob, low-life, big wig, or puritan you are, you should enjoy this film. It's never too sappy when it deals with matters of the heart, nor is it too blunt and insensitive.The film is told almost entirely in a voice over of one of the two main characters. It's told in a brilliant he-said she-said style where the same scene is often told twice from the two opposite points of view (Juli's and Bryce's). So we see the opening scene twice. The first time as explained by Bryce, and the second time explained by Juli. This sort of formula is used many a time in the unfolding battle of the sexes. Of course this doesn't happen in every scene—that would get boring. Director Reiner gives us the proper dosage of everything in this film. The proper amount of comedy, romance, and the proper amount of sadness. Never is it sappy or indulgent or even presumptuous. It's a perfect film for what it's worth. The screenplay is absolutely the work of a fine craftsman—or craftsmen Andrew Scheinman and director Reiner. I don't know how long it took to write or how much blood went into it, but this film is the result of excellent work in every department. The two child stars are perfect in their roles (although Bryce could have done better), but the strength of the cast are in supporting actors. The cast is full of great actors, particularly Anthony Edwards as Bryce's arrogant, critical, smart-Aleck father, and the ever-welcome Aidan Quinn as Juli's loving, down-to-earth, tree painting father.I wasn't completely convinced of the excellence of the film until a beautiful scene in which Mr. Baker (Quinn) and Juli go to visit Mr. Baker's mentally retarded brother Daniel, who is so happy with the world and everything in it. But this scene can't be expressed in words, you have to see it. For what it's worth, Flipped is somewhat of a deep film, full of parallels to the real world. All of the characters have the proper amount of development, even the big sycamore tree that Juli likes to sit in and watch the sunrise. Her exploits while up in that tree are so poetic and beautiful when matched up with the pictures on screen. It's a beautiful and insightful scene into the thoughts and feelings of people in general, not just a teenage girl.In this day when films are almost all big-budget action movies with loud explosions, Flipped has explosions of its own kind. It has explosions of heart and feeling and character, all at the appropriate times. I did not find any ax to grind here. Other than the characters, plot, and screenplay, it's also a technically beautiful film. The camera captures everything so clearly with the proper color timing and excellently framed shots. After the mid-way point of the film, being surrounded by excellence, one starts to look for any reason to criticize the film. I found none. Every nuance of the film is done so genteelly and honestly, who can have a problem with it? This film achieves what movies are meant to achieve. They are meant to reach into are minds and draw us in, to entertain and to move us with fright, emotion, tears, laughs, whatever may be the subject. They are meant to create a world around us, whether in space, in the Wild West, in the future, in Bible times, or in the case of Flipped in 1960s suburbia. This film does exactly what it is meant to do. To touch and make us laugh and to remember. That's what it does. It makes us remember what happened or is happening to us. No one can give this a bad review. I don't see how anyone can pick a fight with the film. But I'm blabbing about nothing.In short, Flipped is by far the best film I've seen this year. I do hope the Academy doesn't overlook this like they do so many other ""family"" films. It should at least get a few nominations, if not a win. We'll see what happens. It's only July.www.colewebbharter.com

                This is a coming of age film set initially and briefly in the late 1950s and mostly in the early 1960s. The boy, Bryce, is chased by his neighbor girl, Juli. And is he chased! Juli is immediately smitten or ""flipped"" by Bryce's eyes and the story unfolds.What is unusual about the story telling is that each major event is played back twice - once through the eyes and voice of Bryce and once through the eyes and voice of Juli. It's the same scene, but you wouldn't know that from their differing viewpoints.Juli is the adventurous and interesting one. Bryce just wants to fit in at their Junior High School. Juli slowly begins to unlike Bryce and Bryce slowly begins to appreciate Juli. Will they ever meet at the same emotional place at the same time? That is the drama and story.The art direction and era are right on. It is the Eisenhower and Kennedy years in look, and even in feel. The wives are subordinate to the husbands. The children are mostly respectful to their parents. And the teachers teach and the students learn. But, you can see the seeds being laid for the rebellious war babies of the late 1960s.Rob Reiner is a talented director for romances - ""When Harry Met Sally."" And he is a talented director for handling young actors - ""Stand By Me."" He combines these talents to help us understand the better part of the human condition; that is, love, respect, sacrifice, forgiveness, and honor. And we have fun and laugh along the way. This is like the TV program, ""Wonder Years"" - but heightened and deepened.-Bob, a Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award Jury Member

                Flipped is a one in a million film - I mean, REALLY one in a million. It's refreshing and lovely, dramatic and hilarious. It does what few films do in our time (or rather what they don't do): Flipped does not sacrifice its integrity for raunchy, gratuitous content. It's real. The emotions are real. The characters are real. And while it certainly isn't G-rated fluff (and do not be fooled - this is not a film for young children), the movie is definitely gentle and innocent in many ways. On the downside, without giving anything away, the ending of the film could have been better patched together, but overall the movie is a cinematic gem like no other. Go see Flipped!

                Beautifully told with all the ingredients for a good family movie. The story is told from two different views, the view from the boy and from the girl. A boy who is annoyed by all the attention he gets from the girl across the street. The girl from across the street who has a super crush on the boy tells her part of the story. The boy's father is a man filled with hatred who dispenses politically incorrect lines throughout the movie. The grandfather, the great John Mohoney, is the wise person who tells the boy to really see the girl for what she is, a very special girl. I don't want to give anything away of this jewel of a movie. I enjoyed this movie very much and totally recommend it.

                A very enjoyable movie, effectively embracing the coming of age sensitivities which come to us all. Although it is clear there are many nuances of other characters which never get dealt with, it's meant to be that way. This is about the kids, the effect they have on one another, their ability and inability to express their feelings, and what can happen when we finally face our fears about the other sex and dare to take a step toward resolving them. The only issue I have is that the film simply has too many anachronisms -- songs not of the period and figures of speech clearly from the present and not the fifties and sixties, but hey, I'm too darn picky about that stuff. Reiner has done it again, offering us a film in the style and tone of Capra. He has crafted a film of sensitivity and grace, and taught us something about life that most of us lose upon becoming adults. Madeline Carroll is simply wonderful as the independent teen taking life head on, and is a true pleasure to watch. She absolutely carries this film.

                Of all the movies I've seen lately, Flipped was amongst the most refreshing. If it had been done by a different director and had different screenwriters, it might be a terrible cliché. Story of first love, known each other since kids, bla bla bla, we've all heard it before.But this movie, it was so pure and so realistic, which is what I love about it most. It wasn't over the top romantic, but it was enough to tug my heartstrings and made me go ""awwww"" instead of going ""ewwww"".The characters felt like real people, and the issues faced in the story felt so real and believable, it made me believe in the basic form of love once more, and that it still existed in real life (even though I know it's just in the movies, but still).Anyway, if you're looking for a story that is refreshing yet vintage, and wanting to have a lovey-dovey grin plastered on your face, then this is the movie to watch.

","
                Flipped is a sweet, charming, moving, lovely, well-acted coming-of-age romantic drama comedy film.While the plot offers nothing new in particular (as with mostly all rom- com films)...the 'girl meets boy' mixed with 'the not-your-typical girl next door' story, but the storytelling is slightly different. Adapted from the book with the same name by Wendelin Van Draanen, the film is presented in a rather unique 'he-said she-said' style, through the eyes and thoughts of the male lead, Bryce and then again through the eyes and thoughts of female lead, Juli, alternately presenting their views and perspectives on a shared set of events. Nearly every single event that happened in the film is told at least twice, although it seems repetitive, but surprisingly, it never feels boring or annoying. It's actually fascinating and insightful to be able to see into the thoughts and feelings of people in general. Things are not really what it seems and there's always more than meets the eye. As the film progresses, you are so emotionally invested in the characters that you actually begin to eagerly anticipate what the other side of the story might be, how the other person feels the way he/she does. The film also gives a feeling of nostalgia, even for those who never lived in the era (the story is set in 50's or 60's suburban area) or experienced the same events as the two leads. It feels authentic and relatable nonetheless. Juli might appear as an ordinary girl, but she's a sweet, kind, beautiful, daring girl at heart once you get to know her.The two lead stars are perfect in their respective roles. Most of the characters in the film have sufficient character development for the audience to understand them. Flipped is a period young love story, told in a simple and heartfelt manner. A rare cinematic gem.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/shorter-movie-review-flipped.html Rating: 8/10""A painting is more than the sum of its parts. A cow by itself is just a cow.

                I feel that this is not a movie about love and first love, but how people should treat themselves and others who seem to be incompatible with their surroundings, how to face the embarrassment and difficulties in life, and learn and grow.

","
                Flipped is a coming of age film directed by the coming of age master director Rob Reiner. Reiner directed the tear-jerker Stand By Me and is now back to bring Wendelin Van Draanen's novel of the same name to life. What a treat! Flipped and Stand By Me both make me wish my childhood was full of more adventure and fun rather than just me sitting on the computer writing review after review aspiring to be a critic. I get tears in my eyes to both films because I become so attached to the characters and they're living the life I can only dream to have. With the exception of unfaithful parents when it comes to Stand By Me.What came to mind halfway through the film was why couldn't the movie Speak have been this good? This film proves more than 80% can be done by narration from TWO characters different perspective and it can be done well. Why not do the same for Speak? Most of the dialog in this film is internal and not directly word of mouth and it works. Why not treat Speak the same way? Were they afraid they would mess it up? It begs an explanation to why Laurie Halse Anderson's novel's potential on film was unfaithful to it's film companion.Never reading the book, I do know that it was set in the nineties and the two thousands while this film's setting is in the late fifties and early sixties. It's not that big of a deal with the drastic setting change, but maybe I would've been more upset if I was a huge fan of the book to find out the film was set four years in the past.The movie about Bryce Loski (McAuliffe), a kid who moves into the neighborhood at a young age to immediately become eye candy to his new neighbor Juli Baker (Carroll). Bryce is resistant, while Juli is persistent. She is positive Bryce will give her her first kiss and believes Bryce is just a little shy, when really he wants nothing to do with her. Juli continues up until present day middle school to give Bryce the chance to admit his ""feelings"" for her but doesn't.Juli lives across the street from Bryce and her yard is an eyesore. It's paid for by the landlord since most of the money Juli and her family makes is given to Juli's father's mentally challenged brother. Bryce's family, his dad mostly, is annoyed by Juli and her family's crappy yard and continue to bad mouth and make assumptions about the Baker family when they really have no idea what it's like over there.The film is narrated by both leads more often than not. Usually we'll get five minutes or so of Bryce narrating his side of the story, while Juli narrates her's. It's almost an anthology because we see what goes on from Bryce's standpoint while hearing his thoughts at the moment and then we see what happened prior or after the events of Bryce's because we then go to Juli. It's confusing. But it works all the time.At the beginning of the film I thought the narrations were only used for the audience to get affiliated with the lives of the characters and what happened before we got here. We spend ninety minutes or longer with movie characters and some films don't even give you the damn courtesy to provide us with any kind of background information. We are supposed to just be thrown into a film with characters we sometimes don't even find out the last names to.The one minor problem I have with the film is the end. It leaves off on the wrong note. The film is only ninety minutes when it could and should be longer. The place they ended was fine, but the scenes on the DVD cover and poster never occur in the film. What a letdown.Flipped is 2010's underrated masterpiece and it definitely showcases a worthy coming of age film. It's smooth style of directing, great music, calm feeling even at it's most stressful, and strong leads are more than I could've asked for. Rob Reiner is something else. A true talent in the movie business. Especially when making a movie as heartfelt as this one.Starring: Callan McAuliffe, Madeline Carroll, Rebecca De Mornay, Anthony Edwards, John Mahoney, Penelope Ann Miller, Aidan Quinn, and Kevin Weisman. Directed by: Rob Reiner.

                With a technique borrowed from Casino of the story being told from two different protagonist points of view, Rob Reiner gives us a wonderful family film about first love. Flipped is a lot less bloody and a great deal sweeter than Martin Scorsese's gangster classic.The prosperous Loski family moves into the neighborhood where the ne'er do well Bakers live. On that day in the late fifties the kids that grow up to be Callan McAuliffe and Madeline Carroll set eyes on each other. Carroll thinks McAuliffe is the one, but such decisions at the age of 7 are sometimes reconsidered. And McAuliffe can't see her for beans, she's just an annoying girl which is not atypical for the second grade.Moving into junior high school is a different matter. With the onset of puberty both these kids are experiencing conflicting emotions. McAuliffe acts like a jerk sometimes, Carroll expects a bit much.The families are different. Anthony Edwards who is McAuliffe's dad is a bit of a fathead and has a thing about his neighbor's lifestyle. Their yard contains a chicken coop and is not in good shape and it's bringing down the values of the other property on the block. As for Aidan Quinn who is Carroll's dad and his family lives as it does in order to support his brother who lives in a sanitarium, an expensive private one for the mentally retarded. Quinn is a wonderful dad, but the Bakers live a whole lot like the Micawbers waiting for something to turn up.The women are wiser than the men, Rebecca DeMornay and Penelope Ann Miller the wives of Edwards and Quinn respectively bond. McAuliffe also has the wisdom of his maternal grandfather John Mahoney to lean on. He's a surrogate grandfather to Carroll as well.Rob Reiner came up with a real winner. The kids act like real kids as opposed to Hollywood kids. The grownups are neither all wise Deities or complete idiots. The women young and old do come out better than the men. I think everyone is going to like this one.Flipped is highly rated for family viewing.

And then when Bryce did some really mean things to her, I could once again totally empathize with Juli and thought he was a complete jerk. The whole story was very relatable to me in general.

                ""All I ever wanted was for Juli Baker to leave me alone.""Flipped is easily the best love story/relationship movie I've seen since (500) Days of Summer. I'm the kind of guy that you couldn't pay to watch a Nicholas Sparks movie, but that doesn't mean that I can't appreciate a good movie about the highs and lows of love. In a year of formulaic, mind-numbing flicks with no imagination or heart like Letters to Juliet, Flipped is a welcome breath of fresh air. It's about 8 or so years in the lives of two kids who meet when when one of them moves into a new neighborhood. Juli (played by Morgan Lily and Madeline Carroll) is instantly smitten by Bryce (Ryan Ketzner and Callan McAuliffe) the second she sees him drive up to his new house. Bryce, being a typical second grade boy, finds her attention embarrassing and unwanted. As they get older, that dynamic between them remains pretty much the same, but we wouldn't have a very interesting movie if that's all there was to it. Eventually Bryce finds himself on the other side of the equation (flipped, get it?), and has to win back the girl he never knew he always wanted.How odd is it that a movie about a couple of kids handles the topic of love in a more mature and genuine way than almost all of the adult-oriented romantic comedies that we're buried under each year? There's no doubt about it that Flipped will make you say ""aww"" on occasion, but there's a lot more to it than just kids being cute. Humor, issues of class, family conflict, and the lost idealism of youth are introduced into the story by Bryce and Juli's respective families, and there are several outright bittersweet or poignant scenes within the story.The movie is shown from the POV's of both main characters, and often the same event will be shown from each of their perspectives. It works really well, as it really helps the viewer to ""get"" both Bryce and Juli. The kids chosen to play the older versions of the two (Carroll and McAuliffe) are both great, the fact that the story is set in 50's or 60's suburbia adds a believable sense of innocence to it all, and there is just a fresh feeling to the movie that I can't really describe with words.I heartily recommend this to anyone who likes a good, well-written movie, regardless of the genre. You can tell that a lot of heart went into making Flipped, and it shows. Great movie.

                'Flipped' is truly a ""real movie"". Probably what most people enjoyed about this movie was that the events that happened in the movie could might as well have been their reality. Many people in this world (if not all) have experienced having a real crush. This movie shows a crush blossoming from both a guy's and a girl's view. It was very interesting to see two viewpoints on this everyday happening. That is what makes this movie so appealing. Viewers get to watch Bryce and Juli's emotions whenever they see the other. Viewers see Bryce and Juli's smiles that they can't help. Viewers get to know who exactly Bryce and Juli are.Anyone and everyone will enjoy this movie or can at least, relate to it. Even adults! This film will surely take you down memory lane and help you remember the feelings you had when you were first in love. I've never experienced being in love before, but this film makes it seem wonderful. I absolutely loved this film.Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe were great in this film! Even if they're very young, they did wonderful jobs in performing here. In each of their scenes, you could sense the emotions that they were feeling and wanted to convey to the viewers. The characters themselves were also very interesting. Particularly Ms. Juli Baker. It was nice to see such a free-spirited teenager, who was very opinionated and didn't let anything stand in her way. The chemistry that both actors had were average. I thought that they showed their most potential when acting by themselves, in their own surroundings.I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that Rob Reiner, the director of this film, was the same person who directed 'When Harry Met Sally' and 'Sleepless in Seattle'. So far, all romantic-comedies that Rob Reiner has directed has not disappointed me. I can't wait for more of his works! All his rom-coms are excellent additions to the romance movie genre.This was an amazing teenage romantic comedy. Surely one of my favorites, right up there with 'When Harry Met Sally'. Do not miss this film. It's baffling to see that this film isn't as popular as it's supposed to be.Viewed on: April 5, 2011 ; December 16, 2011

                Juli just had to take one look at Bryce's blue eyes, and she knew it was true love. Bryce just had to take one notice of Juli's manic desperation, and he knew it was going to be a friendship of torment. I just had to take one look at the film's artfully designed poster, and I knew ""Flipped"" was a film to be savoured.A beautifully told film of first love, we flip from Juli's point of view to Bryce's point of view, very effectively giving us the true nature of their friendship, love and respect they have for each other. Except in the case of middle-school graders, that love and respect can frequently look like embarrassment, mistrust, and shame. All of those emotions are told with intelligence, subtlety and humour.""Flipped"" has all of the comedy, naiveté and bewilderment of first love. It takes the romantic comedy farther by actually giving us characters with real depth. There is more going on than just Juli and Bryce figuring out their love for each other, and every aspect of this film is well written, touching and relevant.""Flipped"" is a cute film for everybody who fondly remembers that fiercely independent girl or the guy with piercing blue eyes that lived across the street.

                ""Flipped"" is superbly directed by Rob Reiner and in my book, one of his best movies. It's a wonderfully told coming-of-age story, which I could relate to in many ways. The main two characters, Juli and Bryce, are very likable. Their parents, played by Penelope Ann Miller and Aidan Quinn, Rebecca de Mornay and Anthony Edwards, respectively, are believable in their roles, which they play excellently. I liked the fact that the story is told from two points of views, Bryce first and then Juli. If you want to see a really feel-good movie, instead of watching some dumb comedy or shoot 'em up flick, go see FLIPPED! You will not regret it.

                I just discovered this gem on Netflix and was impressed, moved and entertained. Its a romantic film about puppy love, so it may not be for everyone (even teens) but I found the leads to be charming and charismatic. The plot device is nothing new, but the charm and early 60's setting make it fresh in many ways. A wonderful cast led by the young leads (now grown!), the late John Mahoney and Aidan Quinn help make this film watchable and enjoyable. A wholesome movie with wonderful moments.

The character development was good, not like many movies which focus on only the main characters.

                Back in 1973, an episode of ""All in the Family"" told the same story from three different perspectives, one of which was from the point of view of Mike ""Meathead"" Stivic, played by Rob Reiner. Watching his latest directorial effort, I wondered if the ""he said / she said"" gimmick of that episode (""Everybody Tells the Truth"") was what attracted Reiner to ""Flipped,"" the young-adult novel by Wendelin Van Draanen, which employs the same multi-POV technique that Lawrence Durrell perfected with his ""Alexandria Quartet"" in the late 1950s. The film version of ""Flipped"" shows Reiner at the top of his form, a worthy addition to an ouevre that includes such classics as ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" ""Misery,"" ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Stand By Me,"" the 1986 period piece that ""Flipped"" most recalls, with its younger characters and coming-of-age theme. At the heart of ""Flipped"" is Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll), a smart, pretty and thoughtful girl who you just can't help losing your heart to. Juli herself flips for Bryce Loski, who is at first repelled by Juli and then slowly starts to see her for the lovely person she is. The cast is augmented by such pros as John Mahoney (Frasier's dad on ""Cheers""), Anthony Edwards, Aidan Quinn and Rebecca De Mornay and Penelope Ann Miller. The film offers up various slices of life from the late '50s and early '60s that makes for a nostalgic, romantic and very moving film. Special kudos to the filmmakers for finding a girl to play young Juli (Morgan Lily) who looks chillingly like Madeline Carroll; I would have bet anything the two were sisters. For those who are bored by the dumb-dumb summer comedies of 2010 (""The Other Guys,"" ""Dinner for Schmucks"") and the special-effects hijinks of ""Inception,"" this is a tender and emotionally satisfying journey that will stay with you for years.

                I really, really liked this film and now wonder why it didn't make more impact when it debuted. Perhaps it was just one of those films that slipped between the cracks because ""Flipped"" is a wonderful coming of age film--and is among director Rob Reiner's best.The film is set mostly in the early 1960s. A young boy, Bryce, moves to a new neighborhood and almost instantly the girl across the street, Juli, begins mooning over him and acting like she's infatuated with him. But he's 7--and hating girls and mushy stuff is normal and he resists her charms. But she persists as the years pass--and she's convinced herself that Bryce is her dream boy. But, as the years pass, Bryce is just as convinced that Juli is a pest. However, eventually, Bryce's attitude starts to change...too bad Juli's is as well!This is a remarkable film in so many ways. The direction is wonderful--perfectly paced and very sweet. The writing is also exceptionally sweet and enchanting. It also helped that there were some wonderful supporting actors to assist in telling the story-- some characters you really liked and cared about and a couple who were complete jerks. John Mahoney was particularly good, but the entire cast was wonderful in this movie. Overall, the elements all work together to tell a sweet story that anyone could love. My only quibble, and it's a very minor one, is about the music. Too many older films are saturated with oldies music. While a bit is nice, with some it sounds more like a best of record album...and at times I would have preferred ""Flipped"" to have been a bit quieter. Not a major complaint by any means and I still give this film a well deserved 9.

                Okay, let's dispense immediately with the idea that this film is geared toward teenagers and all of their sap that they go through. I assure you ""mature adults"" out there that this film will delight you also, unless you are a completely hopelessly lost Scrooge. This film should make sense to all ages. Everyone should identify with it. I don't care what kind of a snob, low-life, big wig, or puritan you are, you should enjoy this film. It's never too sappy when it deals with matters of the heart, nor is it too blunt and insensitive.The film is told almost entirely in a voice over of one of the two main characters. It's told in a brilliant he-said she-said style where the same scene is often told twice from the two opposite points of view (Juli's and Bryce's). So we see the opening scene twice. The first time as explained by Bryce, and the second time explained by Juli. This sort of formula is used many a time in the unfolding battle of the sexes. Of course this doesn't happen in every scene—that would get boring. Director Reiner gives us the proper dosage of everything in this film. The proper amount of comedy, romance, and the proper amount of sadness. Never is it sappy or indulgent or even presumptuous. It's a perfect film for what it's worth. The screenplay is absolutely the work of a fine craftsman—or craftsmen Andrew Scheinman and director Reiner. I don't know how long it took to write or how much blood went into it, but this film is the result of excellent work in every department. The two child stars are perfect in their roles (although Bryce could have done better), but the strength of the cast are in supporting actors. The cast is full of great actors, particularly Anthony Edwards as Bryce's arrogant, critical, smart-Aleck father, and the ever-welcome Aidan Quinn as Juli's loving, down-to-earth, tree painting father.I wasn't completely convinced of the excellence of the film until a beautiful scene in which Mr. Baker (Quinn) and Juli go to visit Mr. Baker's mentally retarded brother Daniel, who is so happy with the world and everything in it. But this scene can't be expressed in words, you have to see it. For what it's worth, Flipped is somewhat of a deep film, full of parallels to the real world. All of the characters have the proper amount of development, even the big sycamore tree that Juli likes to sit in and watch the sunrise. Her exploits while up in that tree are so poetic and beautiful when matched up with the pictures on screen. It's a beautiful and insightful scene into the thoughts and feelings of people in general, not just a teenage girl.In this day when films are almost all big-budget action movies with loud explosions, Flipped has explosions of its own kind. It has explosions of heart and feeling and character, all at the appropriate times. I did not find any ax to grind here. Other than the characters, plot, and screenplay, it's also a technically beautiful film. The camera captures everything so clearly with the proper color timing and excellently framed shots. After the mid-way point of the film, being surrounded by excellence, one starts to look for any reason to criticize the film. I found none. Every nuance of the film is done so genteelly and honestly, who can have a problem with it? This film achieves what movies are meant to achieve. They are meant to reach into are minds and draw us in, to entertain and to move us with fright, emotion, tears, laughs, whatever may be the subject. They are meant to create a world around us, whether in space, in the Wild West, in the future, in Bible times, or in the case of Flipped in 1960s suburbia. This film does exactly what it is meant to do. To touch and make us laugh and to remember. That's what it does. It makes us remember what happened or is happening to us. No one can give this a bad review. I don't see how anyone can pick a fight with the film. But I'm blabbing about nothing.In short, Flipped is by far the best film I've seen this year. I do hope the Academy doesn't overlook this like they do so many other ""family"" films. It should at least get a few nominations, if not a win. We'll see what happens. It's only July.www.colewebbharter.com

                This is a coming of age film set initially and briefly in the late 1950s and mostly in the early 1960s. The boy, Bryce, is chased by his neighbor girl, Juli. And is he chased! Juli is immediately smitten or ""flipped"" by Bryce's eyes and the story unfolds.What is unusual about the story telling is that each major event is played back twice - once through the eyes and voice of Bryce and once through the eyes and voice of Juli. It's the same scene, but you wouldn't know that from their differing viewpoints.Juli is the adventurous and interesting one. Bryce just wants to fit in at their Junior High School. Juli slowly begins to unlike Bryce and Bryce slowly begins to appreciate Juli. Will they ever meet at the same emotional place at the same time? That is the drama and story.The art direction and era are right on. It is the Eisenhower and Kennedy years in look, and even in feel. The wives are subordinate to the husbands. The children are mostly respectful to their parents. And the teachers teach and the students learn. But, you can see the seeds being laid for the rebellious war babies of the late 1960s.Rob Reiner is a talented director for romances - ""When Harry Met Sally."" And he is a talented director for handling young actors - ""Stand By Me."" He combines these talents to help us understand the better part of the human condition; that is, love, respect, sacrifice, forgiveness, and honor. And we have fun and laugh along the way. This is like the TV program, ""Wonder Years"" - but heightened and deepened.-Bob, a Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award Jury Member

                Flipped is a one in a million film - I mean, REALLY one in a million. It's refreshing and lovely, dramatic and hilarious. It does what few films do in our time (or rather what they don't do): Flipped does not sacrifice its integrity for raunchy, gratuitous content. It's real. The emotions are real. The characters are real. And while it certainly isn't G-rated fluff (and do not be fooled - this is not a film for young children), the movie is definitely gentle and innocent in many ways. On the downside, without giving anything away, the ending of the film could have been better patched together, but overall the movie is a cinematic gem like no other. Go see Flipped!

                Juli flipped over Bryce. Bryce's dad flips out. Mom and sister wear their hair in a flip.Charming tale told in a ""he said she said"" often voice-over manner. Interesting enough and short enough so the style doesn't detract. Don't let the print ads mislead you. Bryce never climbs the tree.Excellent performances from the entire cast. Outstanding use of period music. Great collection of shinning '57 Chevy's.Courage, family values, character and nothing explodes. People of every age are treated with respect. What a refreshing movie. Archie Bunker was wrong, Rob Reiner got it right again. He's no meat-head.

                Beautifully told with all the ingredients for a good family movie. The story is told from two different views, the view from the boy and from the girl. A boy who is annoyed by all the attention he gets from the girl across the street. The girl from across the street who has a super crush on the boy tells her part of the story. The boy's father is a man filled with hatred who dispenses politically incorrect lines throughout the movie. The grandfather, the great John Mohoney, is the wise person who tells the boy to really see the girl for what she is, a very special girl. I don't want to give anything away of this jewel of a movie. I enjoyed this movie very much and totally recommend it.

Also,I bought this impressive American novel last year,which is as great as the movie.

                A very enjoyable movie, effectively embracing the coming of age sensitivities which come to us all. Although it is clear there are many nuances of other characters which never get dealt with, it's meant to be that way. This is about the kids, the effect they have on one another, their ability and inability to express their feelings, and what can happen when we finally face our fears about the other sex and dare to take a step toward resolving them. The only issue I have is that the film simply has too many anachronisms -- songs not of the period and figures of speech clearly from the present and not the fifties and sixties, but hey, I'm too darn picky about that stuff. Reiner has done it again, offering us a film in the style and tone of Capra. He has crafted a film of sensitivity and grace, and taught us something about life that most of us lose upon becoming adults. Madeline Carroll is simply wonderful as the independent teen taking life head on, and is a true pleasure to watch. She absolutely carries this film.

                Of all the movies I've seen lately, Flipped was amongst the most refreshing. If it had been done by a different director and had different screenwriters, it might be a terrible cliché. Story of first love, known each other since kids, bla bla bla, we've all heard it before.But this movie, it was so pure and so realistic, which is what I love about it most. It wasn't over the top romantic, but it was enough to tug my heartstrings and made me go ""awwww"" instead of going ""ewwww"".The characters felt like real people, and the issues faced in the story felt so real and believable, it made me believe in the basic form of love once more, and that it still existed in real life (even though I know it's just in the movies, but still).Anyway, if you're looking for a story that is refreshing yet vintage, and wanting to have a lovey-dovey grin plastered on your face, then this is the movie to watch.

                Flipped is a sweet, charming, moving, lovely, well-acted coming-of-age romantic drama comedy film.While the plot offers nothing new in particular (as with mostly all rom- com films)...the 'girl meets boy' mixed with 'the not-your-typical girl next door' story, but the storytelling is slightly different. Adapted from the book with the same name by Wendelin Van Draanen, the film is presented in a rather unique 'he-said she-said' style, through the eyes and thoughts of the male lead, Bryce and then again through the eyes and thoughts of female lead, Juli, alternately presenting their views and perspectives on a shared set of events. Nearly every single event that happened in the film is told at least twice, although it seems repetitive, but surprisingly, it never feels boring or annoying. It's actually fascinating and insightful to be able to see into the thoughts and feelings of people in general. Things are not really what it seems and there's always more than meets the eye. As the film progresses, you are so emotionally invested in the characters that you actually begin to eagerly anticipate what the other side of the story might be, how the other person feels the way he/she does. The film also gives a feeling of nostalgia, even for those who never lived in the era (the story is set in 50's or 60's suburban area) or experienced the same events as the two leads. It feels authentic and relatable nonetheless. Juli might appear as an ordinary girl, but she's a sweet, kind, beautiful, daring girl at heart once you get to know her.The two lead stars are perfect in their respective roles. Most of the characters in the film have sufficient character development for the audience to understand them. Flipped is a period young love story, told in a simple and heartfelt manner. A rare cinematic gem.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/shorter-movie-review-flipped.html Rating: 8/10""A painting is more than the sum of its parts. A cow by itself is just a cow.

                Flipped is a coming of age film directed by the coming of age master director Rob Reiner. Reiner directed the tear-jerker Stand By Me and is now back to bring Wendelin Van Draanen's novel of the same name to life. What a treat! Flipped and Stand By Me both make me wish my childhood was full of more adventure and fun rather than just me sitting on the computer writing review after review aspiring to be a critic. I get tears in my eyes to both films because I become so attached to the characters and they're living the life I can only dream to have. With the exception of unfaithful parents when it comes to Stand By Me.What came to mind halfway through the film was why couldn't the movie Speak have been this good? This film proves more than 80% can be done by narration from TWO characters different perspective and it can be done well. Why not do the same for Speak? Most of the dialog in this film is internal and not directly word of mouth and it works. Why not treat Speak the same way? Were they afraid they would mess it up? It begs an explanation to why Laurie Halse Anderson's novel's potential on film was unfaithful to it's film companion.Never reading the book, I do know that it was set in the nineties and the two thousands while this film's setting is in the late fifties and early sixties. It's not that big of a deal with the drastic setting change, but maybe I would've been more upset if I was a huge fan of the book to find out the film was set four years in the past.The movie about Bryce Loski (McAuliffe), a kid who moves into the neighborhood at a young age to immediately become eye candy to his new neighbor Juli Baker (Carroll). Bryce is resistant, while Juli is persistent. She is positive Bryce will give her her first kiss and believes Bryce is just a little shy, when really he wants nothing to do with her. Juli continues up until present day middle school to give Bryce the chance to admit his ""feelings"" for her but doesn't.Juli lives across the street from Bryce and her yard is an eyesore. It's paid for by the landlord since most of the money Juli and her family makes is given to Juli's father's mentally challenged brother. Bryce's family, his dad mostly, is annoyed by Juli and her family's crappy yard and continue to bad mouth and make assumptions about the Baker family when they really have no idea what it's like over there.The film is narrated by both leads more often than not. Usually we'll get five minutes or so of Bryce narrating his side of the story, while Juli narrates her's. It's almost an anthology because we see what goes on from Bryce's standpoint while hearing his thoughts at the moment and then we see what happened prior or after the events of Bryce's because we then go to Juli. It's confusing. But it works all the time.At the beginning of the film I thought the narrations were only used for the audience to get affiliated with the lives of the characters and what happened before we got here. We spend ninety minutes or longer with movie characters and some films don't even give you the damn courtesy to provide us with any kind of background information. We are supposed to just be thrown into a film with characters we sometimes don't even find out the last names to.The one minor problem I have with the film is the end. It leaves off on the wrong note. The film is only ninety minutes when it could and should be longer. The place they ended was fine, but the scenes on the DVD cover and poster never occur in the film. What a letdown.Flipped is 2010's underrated masterpiece and it definitely showcases a worthy coming of age film. It's smooth style of directing, great music, calm feeling even at it's most stressful, and strong leads are more than I could've asked for. Rob Reiner is something else. A true talent in the movie business. Especially when making a movie as heartfelt as this one.Starring: Callan McAuliffe, Madeline Carroll, Rebecca De Mornay, Anthony Edwards, John Mahoney, Penelope Ann Miller, Aidan Quinn, and Kevin Weisman. Directed by: Rob Reiner.

                With a technique borrowed from Casino of the story being told from two different protagonist points of view, Rob Reiner gives us a wonderful family film about first love. Flipped is a lot less bloody and a great deal sweeter than Martin Scorsese's gangster classic.The prosperous Loski family moves into the neighborhood where the ne'er do well Bakers live. On that day in the late fifties the kids that grow up to be Callan McAuliffe and Madeline Carroll set eyes on each other. Carroll thinks McAuliffe is the one, but such decisions at the age of 7 are sometimes reconsidered. And McAuliffe can't see her for beans, she's just an annoying girl which is not atypical for the second grade.Moving into junior high school is a different matter. With the onset of puberty both these kids are experiencing conflicting emotions. McAuliffe acts like a jerk sometimes, Carroll expects a bit much.The families are different. Anthony Edwards who is McAuliffe's dad is a bit of a fathead and has a thing about his neighbor's lifestyle. Their yard contains a chicken coop and is not in good shape and it's bringing down the values of the other property on the block. As for Aidan Quinn who is Carroll's dad and his family lives as it does in order to support his brother who lives in a sanitarium, an expensive private one for the mentally retarded. Quinn is a wonderful dad, but the Bakers live a whole lot like the Micawbers waiting for something to turn up.The women are wiser than the men, Rebecca DeMornay and Penelope Ann Miller the wives of Edwards and Quinn respectively bond. McAuliffe also has the wisdom of his maternal grandfather John Mahoney to lean on. He's a surrogate grandfather to Carroll as well.Rob Reiner came up with a real winner. The kids act like real kids as opposed to Hollywood kids. The grownups are neither all wise Deities or complete idiots. The women young and old do come out better than the men. I think everyone is going to like this one.Flipped is highly rated for family viewing.

                Loved it. Bryce is so handsome, i could totally empathize with Juli when she would talk about his dazzling eyes. And then when Bryce did some really mean things to her, I could once again totally empathize with Juli and thought he was a complete jerk. The whole story was very relatable to me in general.

                ""All I ever wanted was for Juli Baker to leave me alone.""Flipped is easily the best love story/relationship movie I've seen since (500) Days of Summer. I'm the kind of guy that you couldn't pay to watch a Nicholas Sparks movie, but that doesn't mean that I can't appreciate a good movie about the highs and lows of love. In a year of formulaic, mind-numbing flicks with no imagination or heart like Letters to Juliet, Flipped is a welcome breath of fresh air. It's about 8 or so years in the lives of two kids who meet when when one of them moves into a new neighborhood. Juli (played by Morgan Lily and Madeline Carroll) is instantly smitten by Bryce (Ryan Ketzner and Callan McAuliffe) the second she sees him drive up to his new house. Bryce, being a typical second grade boy, finds her attention embarrassing and unwanted. As they get older, that dynamic between them remains pretty much the same, but we wouldn't have a very interesting movie if that's all there was to it. Eventually Bryce finds himself on the other side of the equation (flipped, get it?), and has to win back the girl he never knew he always wanted.How odd is it that a movie about a couple of kids handles the topic of love in a more mature and genuine way than almost all of the adult-oriented romantic comedies that we're buried under each year? There's no doubt about it that Flipped will make you say ""aww"" on occasion, but there's a lot more to it than just kids being cute. Humor, issues of class, family conflict, and the lost idealism of youth are introduced into the story by Bryce and Juli's respective families, and there are several outright bittersweet or poignant scenes within the story.The movie is shown from the POV's of both main characters, and often the same event will be shown from each of their perspectives. It works really well, as it really helps the viewer to ""get"" both Bryce and Juli. The kids chosen to play the older versions of the two (Carroll and McAuliffe) are both great, the fact that the story is set in 50's or 60's suburbia adds a believable sense of innocence to it all, and there is just a fresh feeling to the movie that I can't really describe with words.I heartily recommend this to anyone who likes a good, well-written movie, regardless of the genre. You can tell that a lot of heart went into making Flipped, and it shows. Great movie.

                'Flipped' is truly a ""real movie"". Probably what most people enjoyed about this movie was that the events that happened in the movie could might as well have been their reality. Many people in this world (if not all) have experienced having a real crush. This movie shows a crush blossoming from both a guy's and a girl's view. It was very interesting to see two viewpoints on this everyday happening. That is what makes this movie so appealing. Viewers get to watch Bryce and Juli's emotions whenever they see the other. Viewers see Bryce and Juli's smiles that they can't help. Viewers get to know who exactly Bryce and Juli are.Anyone and everyone will enjoy this movie or can at least, relate to it. Even adults! This film will surely take you down memory lane and help you remember the feelings you had when you were first in love. I've never experienced being in love before, but this film makes it seem wonderful. I absolutely loved this film.Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe were great in this film! Even if they're very young, they did wonderful jobs in performing here. In each of their scenes, you could sense the emotions that they were feeling and wanted to convey to the viewers. The characters themselves were also very interesting. Particularly Ms. Juli Baker. It was nice to see such a free-spirited teenager, who was very opinionated and didn't let anything stand in her way. The chemistry that both actors had were average. I thought that they showed their most potential when acting by themselves, in their own surroundings.I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that Rob Reiner, the director of this film, was the same person who directed 'When Harry Met Sally' and 'Sleepless in Seattle'. So far, all romantic-comedies that Rob Reiner has directed has not disappointed me. I can't wait for more of his works! All his rom-coms are excellent additions to the romance movie genre.This was an amazing teenage romantic comedy. Surely one of my favorites, right up there with 'When Harry Met Sally'. Do not miss this film. It's baffling to see that this film isn't as popular as it's supposed to be.Viewed on: April 5, 2011 ; December 16, 2011

                Juli just had to take one look at Bryce's blue eyes, and she knew it was true love. Bryce just had to take one notice of Juli's manic desperation, and he knew it was going to be a friendship of torment. I just had to take one look at the film's artfully designed poster, and I knew ""Flipped"" was a film to be savoured.A beautifully told film of first love, we flip from Juli's point of view to Bryce's point of view, very effectively giving us the true nature of their friendship, love and respect they have for each other. Except in the case of middle-school graders, that love and respect can frequently look like embarrassment, mistrust, and shame. All of those emotions are told with intelligence, subtlety and humour.""Flipped"" has all of the comedy, naiveté and bewilderment of first love. It takes the romantic comedy farther by actually giving us characters with real depth. There is more going on than just Juli and Bryce figuring out their love for each other, and every aspect of this film is well written, touching and relevant.""Flipped"" is a cute film for everybody who fondly remembers that fiercely independent girl or the guy with piercing blue eyes that lived across the street.

                ""Flipped"" is superbly directed by Rob Reiner and in my book, one of his best movies. It's a wonderfully told coming-of-age story, which I could relate to in many ways. The main two characters, Juli and Bryce, are very likable. Their parents, played by Penelope Ann Miller and Aidan Quinn, Rebecca de Mornay and Anthony Edwards, respectively, are believable in their roles, which they play excellently. I liked the fact that the story is told from two points of views, Bryce first and then Juli. If you want to see a really feel-good movie, instead of watching some dumb comedy or shoot 'em up flick, go see FLIPPED! You will not regret it.

                I just discovered this gem on Netflix and was impressed, moved and entertained. Its a romantic film about puppy love, so it may not be for everyone (even teens) but I found the leads to be charming and charismatic. The plot device is nothing new, but the charm and early 60's setting make it fresh in many ways. A wonderful cast led by the young leads (now grown!), the late John Mahoney and Aidan Quinn help make this film watchable and enjoyable. A wholesome movie with wonderful moments.

The character development was good, not like many movies which focus on only the main characters.

                Back in 1973, an episode of ""All in the Family"" told the same story from three different perspectives, one of which was from the point of view of Mike ""Meathead"" Stivic, played by Rob Reiner. Watching his latest directorial effort, I wondered if the ""he said / she said"" gimmick of that episode (""Everybody Tells the Truth"") was what attracted Reiner to ""Flipped,"" the young-adult novel by Wendelin Van Draanen, which employs the same multi-POV technique that Lawrence Durrell perfected with his ""Alexandria Quartet"" in the late 1950s. The film version of ""Flipped"" shows Reiner at the top of his form, a worthy addition to an ouevre that includes such classics as ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" ""Misery,"" ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Stand By Me,"" the 1986 period piece that ""Flipped"" most recalls, with its younger characters and coming-of-age theme. At the heart of ""Flipped"" is Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll), a smart, pretty and thoughtful girl who you just can't help losing your heart to. Juli herself flips for Bryce Loski, who is at first repelled by Juli and then slowly starts to see her for the lovely person she is. The cast is augmented by such pros as John Mahoney (Frasier's dad on ""Cheers""), Anthony Edwards, Aidan Quinn and Rebecca De Mornay and Penelope Ann Miller. The film offers up various slices of life from the late '50s and early '60s that makes for a nostalgic, romantic and very moving film. Special kudos to the filmmakers for finding a girl to play young Juli (Morgan Lily) who looks chillingly like Madeline Carroll; I would have bet anything the two were sisters. For those who are bored by the dumb-dumb summer comedies of 2010 (""The Other Guys,"" ""Dinner for Schmucks"") and the special-effects hijinks of ""Inception,"" this is a tender and emotionally satisfying journey that will stay with you for years.

                I really, really liked this film and now wonder why it didn't make more impact when it debuted. Perhaps it was just one of those films that slipped between the cracks because ""Flipped"" is a wonderful coming of age film--and is among director Rob Reiner's best.The film is set mostly in the early 1960s. A young boy, Bryce, moves to a new neighborhood and almost instantly the girl across the street, Juli, begins mooning over him and acting like she's infatuated with him. But he's 7--and hating girls and mushy stuff is normal and he resists her charms. But she persists as the years pass--and she's convinced herself that Bryce is her dream boy. But, as the years pass, Bryce is just as convinced that Juli is a pest. However, eventually, Bryce's attitude starts to change...too bad Juli's is as well!This is a remarkable film in so many ways. The direction is wonderful--perfectly paced and very sweet. The writing is also exceptionally sweet and enchanting. It also helped that there were some wonderful supporting actors to assist in telling the story-- some characters you really liked and cared about and a couple who were complete jerks. John Mahoney was particularly good, but the entire cast was wonderful in this movie. Overall, the elements all work together to tell a sweet story that anyone could love. My only quibble, and it's a very minor one, is about the music. Too many older films are saturated with oldies music. While a bit is nice, with some it sounds more like a best of record album...and at times I would have preferred ""Flipped"" to have been a bit quieter. Not a major complaint by any means and I still give this film a well deserved 9.

                Okay, let's dispense immediately with the idea that this film is geared toward teenagers and all of their sap that they go through. I assure you ""mature adults"" out there that this film will delight you also, unless you are a completely hopelessly lost Scrooge. This film should make sense to all ages. Everyone should identify with it. I don't care what kind of a snob, low-life, big wig, or puritan you are, you should enjoy this film. It's never too sappy when it deals with matters of the heart, nor is it too blunt and insensitive.The film is told almost entirely in a voice over of one of the two main characters. It's told in a brilliant he-said she-said style where the same scene is often told twice from the two opposite points of view (Juli's and Bryce's). So we see the opening scene twice. The first time as explained by Bryce, and the second time explained by Juli. This sort of formula is used many a time in the unfolding battle of the sexes. Of course this doesn't happen in every scene—that would get boring. Director Reiner gives us the proper dosage of everything in this film. The proper amount of comedy, romance, and the proper amount of sadness. Never is it sappy or indulgent or even presumptuous. It's a perfect film for what it's worth. The screenplay is absolutely the work of a fine craftsman—or craftsmen Andrew Scheinman and director Reiner. I don't know how long it took to write or how much blood went into it, but this film is the result of excellent work in every department. The two child stars are perfect in their roles (although Bryce could have done better), but the strength of the cast are in supporting actors. The cast is full of great actors, particularly Anthony Edwards as Bryce's arrogant, critical, smart-Aleck father, and the ever-welcome Aidan Quinn as Juli's loving, down-to-earth, tree painting father.I wasn't completely convinced of the excellence of the film until a beautiful scene in which Mr. Baker (Quinn) and Juli go to visit Mr. Baker's mentally retarded brother Daniel, who is so happy with the world and everything in it. But this scene can't be expressed in words, you have to see it. For what it's worth, Flipped is somewhat of a deep film, full of parallels to the real world. All of the characters have the proper amount of development, even the big sycamore tree that Juli likes to sit in and watch the sunrise. Her exploits while up in that tree are so poetic and beautiful when matched up with the pictures on screen. It's a beautiful and insightful scene into the thoughts and feelings of people in general, not just a teenage girl.In this day when films are almost all big-budget action movies with loud explosions, Flipped has explosions of its own kind. It has explosions of heart and feeling and character, all at the appropriate times. I did not find any ax to grind here. Other than the characters, plot, and screenplay, it's also a technically beautiful film. The camera captures everything so clearly with the proper color timing and excellently framed shots. After the mid-way point of the film, being surrounded by excellence, one starts to look for any reason to criticize the film. I found none. Every nuance of the film is done so genteelly and honestly, who can have a problem with it? This film achieves what movies are meant to achieve. They are meant to reach into are minds and draw us in, to entertain and to move us with fright, emotion, tears, laughs, whatever may be the subject. They are meant to create a world around us, whether in space, in the Wild West, in the future, in Bible times, or in the case of Flipped in 1960s suburbia. This film does exactly what it is meant to do. To touch and make us laugh and to remember. That's what it does. It makes us remember what happened or is happening to us. No one can give this a bad review. I don't see how anyone can pick a fight with the film. But I'm blabbing about nothing.In short, Flipped is by far the best film I've seen this year. I do hope the Academy doesn't overlook this like they do so many other ""family"" films. It should at least get a few nominations, if not a win. We'll see what happens. It's only July.www.colewebbharter.com

                This is a coming of age film set initially and briefly in the late 1950s and mostly in the early 1960s. The boy, Bryce, is chased by his neighbor girl, Juli. And is he chased! Juli is immediately smitten or ""flipped"" by Bryce's eyes and the story unfolds.What is unusual about the story telling is that each major event is played back twice - once through the eyes and voice of Bryce and once through the eyes and voice of Juli. It's the same scene, but you wouldn't know that from their differing viewpoints.Juli is the adventurous and interesting one. Bryce just wants to fit in at their Junior High School. Juli slowly begins to unlike Bryce and Bryce slowly begins to appreciate Juli. Will they ever meet at the same emotional place at the same time? That is the drama and story.The art direction and era are right on. It is the Eisenhower and Kennedy years in look, and even in feel. The wives are subordinate to the husbands. The children are mostly respectful to their parents. And the teachers teach and the students learn. But, you can see the seeds being laid for the rebellious war babies of the late 1960s.Rob Reiner is a talented director for romances - ""When Harry Met Sally."" And he is a talented director for handling young actors - ""Stand By Me."" He combines these talents to help us understand the better part of the human condition; that is, love, respect, sacrifice, forgiveness, and honor. And we have fun and laugh along the way. This is like the TV program, ""Wonder Years"" - but heightened and deepened.-Bob, a Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award Jury Member

                Flipped is a one in a million film - I mean, REALLY one in a million. It's refreshing and lovely, dramatic and hilarious. It does what few films do in our time (or rather what they don't do): Flipped does not sacrifice its integrity for raunchy, gratuitous content. It's real. The emotions are real. The characters are real. And while it certainly isn't G-rated fluff (and do not be fooled - this is not a film for young children), the movie is definitely gentle and innocent in many ways. On the downside, without giving anything away, the ending of the film could have been better patched together, but overall the movie is a cinematic gem like no other. Go see Flipped!

                Juli flipped over Bryce. Bryce's dad flips out. Mom and sister wear their hair in a flip.Charming tale told in a ""he said she said"" often voice-over manner. Interesting enough and short enough so the style doesn't detract. Don't let the print ads mislead you. Bryce never climbs the tree.Excellent performances from the entire cast. Outstanding use of period music. Great collection of shinning '57 Chevy's.Courage, family values, character and nothing explodes. People of every age are treated with respect. What a refreshing movie. Archie Bunker was wrong, Rob Reiner got it right again. He's no meat-head.

                Beautifully told with all the ingredients for a good family movie. The story is told from two different views, the view from the boy and from the girl. A boy who is annoyed by all the attention he gets from the girl across the street. The girl from across the street who has a super crush on the boy tells her part of the story. The boy's father is a man filled with hatred who dispenses politically incorrect lines throughout the movie. The grandfather, the great John Mohoney, is the wise person who tells the boy to really see the girl for what she is, a very special girl. I don't want to give anything away of this jewel of a movie. I enjoyed this movie very much and totally recommend it.

                It's a FANTASTIC one! I have completely fallen in love with it. The puppy love between Julianna and Bryce is so sweet and comedic.What l enjoy Most about the movie is definitely the picturesque countryside it depicts.Yeah,Countryside,along with little Juli and her ""most beautiful"" sycamore tree.I'm always touched by the bucolic and quaint scene where Juli's sitting in her sycamore tree,feeling the gentle breeze blush her cheek and enjoying the majestic and spectacular sunset ,dying the whole sky red.How amazing!It's just the kind of country life l am always yearning for.
Also,I bought this impressive American novel last year,which is as great as the movie.

                A very enjoyable movie, effectively embracing the coming of age sensitivities which come to us all. Although it is clear there are many nuances of other characters which never get dealt with, it's meant to be that way. This is about the kids, the effect they have on one another, their ability and inability to express their feelings, and what can happen when we finally face our fears about the other sex and dare to take a step toward resolving them. The only issue I have is that the film simply has too many anachronisms -- songs not of the period and figures of speech clearly from the present and not the fifties and sixties, but hey, I'm too darn picky about that stuff. Reiner has done it again, offering us a film in the style and tone of Capra. He has crafted a film of sensitivity and grace, and taught us something about life that most of us lose upon becoming adults. Madeline Carroll is simply wonderful as the independent teen taking life head on, and is a true pleasure to watch. She absolutely carries this film.

                Of all the movies I've seen lately, Flipped was amongst the most refreshing. If it had been done by a different director and had different screenwriters, it might be a terrible cliché. Story of first love, known each other since kids, bla bla bla, we've all heard it before.But this movie, it was so pure and so realistic, which is what I love about it most. It wasn't over the top romantic, but it was enough to tug my heartstrings and made me go ""awwww"" instead of going ""ewwww"".The characters felt like real people, and the issues faced in the story felt so real and believable, it made me believe in the basic form of love once more, and that it still existed in real life (even though I know it's just in the movies, but still).Anyway, if you're looking for a story that is refreshing yet vintage, and wanting to have a lovey-dovey grin plastered on your face, then this is the movie to watch.

                Flipped is a sweet, charming, moving, lovely, well-acted coming-of-age romantic drama comedy film.While the plot offers nothing new in particular (as with mostly all rom- com films)...the 'girl meets boy' mixed with 'the not-your-typical girl next door' story, but the storytelling is slightly different. Adapted from the book with the same name by Wendelin Van Draanen, the film is presented in a rather unique 'he-said she-said' style, through the eyes and thoughts of the male lead, Bryce and then again through the eyes and thoughts of female lead, Juli, alternately presenting their views and perspectives on a shared set of events. Nearly every single event that happened in the film is told at least twice, although it seems repetitive, but surprisingly, it never feels boring or annoying. It's actually fascinating and insightful to be able to see into the thoughts and feelings of people in general. Things are not really what it seems and there's always more than meets the eye. As the film progresses, you are so emotionally invested in the characters that you actually begin to eagerly anticipate what the other side of the story might be, how the other person feels the way he/she does. The film also gives a feeling of nostalgia, even for those who never lived in the era (the story is set in 50's or 60's suburban area) or experienced the same events as the two leads. It feels authentic and relatable nonetheless. Juli might appear as an ordinary girl, but she's a sweet, kind, beautiful, daring girl at heart once you get to know her.The two lead stars are perfect in their respective roles. Most of the characters in the film have sufficient character development for the audience to understand them. Flipped is a period young love story, told in a simple and heartfelt manner. A rare cinematic gem.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/shorter-movie-review-flipped.html Rating: 8/10""A painting is more than the sum of its parts. A cow by itself is just a cow.

                Flipped is a coming of age film directed by the coming of age master director Rob Reiner. Reiner directed the tear-jerker Stand By Me and is now back to bring Wendelin Van Draanen's novel of the same name to life. What a treat! Flipped and Stand By Me both make me wish my childhood was full of more adventure and fun rather than just me sitting on the computer writing review after review aspiring to be a critic. I get tears in my eyes to both films because I become so attached to the characters and they're living the life I can only dream to have. With the exception of unfaithful parents when it comes to Stand By Me.What came to mind halfway through the film was why couldn't the movie Speak have been this good? This film proves more than 80% can be done by narration from TWO characters different perspective and it can be done well. Why not do the same for Speak? Most of the dialog in this film is internal and not directly word of mouth and it works. Why not treat Speak the same way? Were they afraid they would mess it up? It begs an explanation to why Laurie Halse Anderson's novel's potential on film was unfaithful to it's film companion.Never reading the book, I do know that it was set in the nineties and the two thousands while this film's setting is in the late fifties and early sixties. It's not that big of a deal with the drastic setting change, but maybe I would've been more upset if I was a huge fan of the book to find out the film was set four years in the past.The movie about Bryce Loski (McAuliffe), a kid who moves into the neighborhood at a young age to immediately become eye candy to his new neighbor Juli Baker (Carroll). Bryce is resistant, while Juli is persistent. She is positive Bryce will give her her first kiss and believes Bryce is just a little shy, when really he wants nothing to do with her. Juli continues up until present day middle school to give Bryce the chance to admit his ""feelings"" for her but doesn't.Juli lives across the street from Bryce and her yard is an eyesore. It's paid for by the landlord since most of the money Juli and her family makes is given to Juli's father's mentally challenged brother. Bryce's family, his dad mostly, is annoyed by Juli and her family's crappy yard and continue to bad mouth and make assumptions about the Baker family when they really have no idea what it's like over there.The film is narrated by both leads more often than not. Usually we'll get five minutes or so of Bryce narrating his side of the story, while Juli narrates her's. It's almost an anthology because we see what goes on from Bryce's standpoint while hearing his thoughts at the moment and then we see what happened prior or after the events of Bryce's because we then go to Juli. It's confusing. But it works all the time.At the beginning of the film I thought the narrations were only used for the audience to get affiliated with the lives of the characters and what happened before we got here. We spend ninety minutes or longer with movie characters and some films don't even give you the damn courtesy to provide us with any kind of background information. We are supposed to just be thrown into a film with characters we sometimes don't even find out the last names to.The one minor problem I have with the film is the end. It leaves off on the wrong note. The film is only ninety minutes when it could and should be longer. The place they ended was fine, but the scenes on the DVD cover and poster never occur in the film. What a letdown.Flipped is 2010's underrated masterpiece and it definitely showcases a worthy coming of age film. It's smooth style of directing, great music, calm feeling even at it's most stressful, and strong leads are more than I could've asked for. Rob Reiner is something else. A true talent in the movie business. Especially when making a movie as heartfelt as this one.Starring: Callan McAuliffe, Madeline Carroll, Rebecca De Mornay, Anthony Edwards, John Mahoney, Penelope Ann Miller, Aidan Quinn, and Kevin Weisman. Directed by: Rob Reiner.

                With a technique borrowed from Casino of the story being told from two different protagonist points of view, Rob Reiner gives us a wonderful family film about first love. Flipped is a lot less bloody and a great deal sweeter than Martin Scorsese's gangster classic.The prosperous Loski family moves into the neighborhood where the ne'er do well Bakers live. On that day in the late fifties the kids that grow up to be Callan McAuliffe and Madeline Carroll set eyes on each other. Carroll thinks McAuliffe is the one, but such decisions at the age of 7 are sometimes reconsidered. And McAuliffe can't see her for beans, she's just an annoying girl which is not atypical for the second grade.Moving into junior high school is a different matter. With the onset of puberty both these kids are experiencing conflicting emotions. McAuliffe acts like a jerk sometimes, Carroll expects a bit much.The families are different. Anthony Edwards who is McAuliffe's dad is a bit of a fathead and has a thing about his neighbor's lifestyle. Their yard contains a chicken coop and is not in good shape and it's bringing down the values of the other property on the block. As for Aidan Quinn who is Carroll's dad and his family lives as it does in order to support his brother who lives in a sanitarium, an expensive private one for the mentally retarded. Quinn is a wonderful dad, but the Bakers live a whole lot like the Micawbers waiting for something to turn up.The women are wiser than the men, Rebecca DeMornay and Penelope Ann Miller the wives of Edwards and Quinn respectively bond. McAuliffe also has the wisdom of his maternal grandfather John Mahoney to lean on. He's a surrogate grandfather to Carroll as well.Rob Reiner came up with a real winner. The kids act like real kids as opposed to Hollywood kids. The grownups are neither all wise Deities or complete idiots. The women young and old do come out better than the men. I think everyone is going to like this one.Flipped is highly rated for family viewing.
