"TANGLED","TheLittleSongbird","30 January 2011","I am a huge Disney and animation fan, and was really interested in seeing Tangled. For me Disney have so many classics under their wing, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Bambi, Pinocchio, The Little Mermaid and Aladdin especially. For over a decade, the past Disney films ranged from very enjoyable(Emperor's New Groove) to truly disappointing(Chicken Little)- The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Tarzan were the last ones to truly blow me away- until now.While Tangled had me interested, I didn't like how the film was advertised. The trailer looked as though the film would be a Dreamworks knock-off, and I didn't think much of the title either. I needn't have worried, Tangled was wonderful and Disney's best film in a while(I know I said that about last year's Princess and the Frog, yes I actually liked that too, but after seeing Tangled I've changed my mind). The film is so much better than its advertising suggested, it is not a knock-off of Dreamworks and more importantly it not only has the Disney magic but it has something for both kids and adults.What wowed me immediately about Tangled was the animation. It is simply gorgeous. The colours look beautiful, the backgrounds are stunning especially that surrounding Rapunzel's tower and the characters are very well modelled. The real revelations are with Rapunzel's hair, which is a masterstroke and also the floating lanterns, a scene of true beauty and very touching. Alan Menken's music was a surprise and in a good way. For me, this was his best score since The Hunchback of Notre Dame(that score is amazing), I was especially taken with the Kingdom Dance.The songs are also not bad at all, they are not quite instant classics like Colours of the Wind, Beauty and the Beast, When You Wish Upon a Star, Heigh Ho, Part of Your World, Circle of Life, Hellfire, Under the Sea, Whole New World and Bells of Notre Dame are, but they are listenable with beautiful melodies and surprisingly decent lyrics. The best for me were the stunning I See the Light and the goosebump-inducing Mother Knows Best.The writing is another strong asset. Tangled has some truly excellent writing, particularly with Flynn and Rapunzel, it is funny, witty and even touching. The storytelling is polished and is snappily paced, with the action sequences lively and the ending fitting well with the rest of the movie. When I saw the trailer I was expecting a story scattered with pop-culture references and almost laughter-free dialogue, but actually the storytelling does have a classic feel to it and some scenes like the aforementioned floating lanterns give the film its magic.I also loved Tangled's characters. Rapunzel is one sassy heroine and is also someone young girls in particular can relate to. Flynn is a charming, dashing and charismatic hero too, and his interaction with Rapunzel alone gives Tangled its spark. Mother Gothel is another strong character, in her character you can see shades of both Lady Tremaine and Frollo, and on top of that she is a very intriguing villainess. Even more surprising were the comic relief characters. There have been animated films/Disney films where the comedy either works like a glove(Emperor's New Groove), is either hit or miss(I say this with a heavy heart, Hunchback of Notre Dame) or doesn't work at all(Chicken Little). Here the comedy works perfectly, hilarious without being too over-the-top. Pascal is both hilarious and cute and Maximus the horse is a sheer delight in everything he does.The voice acting also adds a lot to the film. Mandy Moore is a perfect choice for Rapunzel, she has a pleasant speaking voice and a beautiful singing voice. I loved the charisma Zachary Levi brings to Flynn, his voice is one of the main reasons why Flynn is as likable as he is, while Donna Murphy is perfect as Mother Gothel.In conclusion, this was a wonderful film and I recommend it heartily for both kids and adults. For Disney fans too, I think you will be delighted, if you want humour, adventure, beautiful animation, good music, classic storytelling, witty scripting and likable characters, Tangled is a perfect match. 10/10 Bethany Cox","

"TANGLED","planktonrules","29 December 2010","I was frankly quite amazed by this film. After all, last year Pixar brought us ""Up"" and this year Dreamworks brought us ""How to Train Your Dragon""—there was no way that anyone could produce a CGI film that is every bit as good, could they?! Yet, surprisingly, I adored ""Tangled"" and enjoyed it just as much as these other films—showing that we are in a period of time when amazingly wonderful computer animation has become the norm.""Tangled"" is wonderful for two main reasons. Foremost, the animation style is so new and vibrant—and looks so much unlike all the other recent CG I films. I read that Disney deliberately tried to create a computer-generated film that looked a lot like a traditionally animated film—and the exquisitely rendered backgrounds attest to the fact that they achieved this goaland more. The other reason I adored it was because the film had a magnificent sense of humor—making a very simple story much, much more enjoyable. The animal friends (the horse and chameleon) were terrific and the film had me laughing repeatedly—particularly with its surprisingly adorable barbarian hoard (who, incidentally, remind me a lot of the Capital One commercials' Vikings). The final reason I loved the film, though it's not as prominent as the other two reasons, is the wonderful love story. The final scene of self-sacrifice by the male hero is touching—and set my tear ducts flowing.By the way, it turns out the only thing about the film I did NOT love (the similarity of the ending to that of Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"") was NOT the fault of bad writing—it's actually one of the few aspects of the that is from the original fairy tale! This tidbit comes from my amazing older daughter who is a folklore major.The bottom line—watch this film! You'll be glad you did—and it's much better than it appears to be based on the TV commercials and previews.","

"TANGLED","intelearts","9 January 2011","With jaw-dropping graphics and an abundance of heart this is simply what you would wish for in a fairy tale: memorable, magical, and magnificent.We cannot remember the last time we saw a film that was simply so entertaining - there is almost nothing to complain about here in any way and much to praise from values to comedy to several scenes that were genuinely moving - this really is one of the best movies of the year and deserves its massive box office success.If perhaps you are reluctant to see it as you think it will just rehash old Disney ideas or be unsuitable for small children I would say those are always my first concerns, but here for the first time in a very long time I can honestly say that here we have a film that holds its own integrity and so, even with the villain's death, you don't feel that it was put in to scare.All in all, a magical, hilarious, witty, and very well thought through movie that deserves the Oscar that is surely coming to it - simply the best animated movie of the year as, more even than Toy Story 3, it rises beyond animation to make a wonderful heart-filled adventure that makes for very satisfying viewing indeed.Thank you, Disney.","

"TANGLED","Blueghost","24 November 2010","A few days ago I saw ""Megamind"", and thought it was just okay. I enjoyed it for what it was, but I didn't think it too spectacular. My faith in CGI entertainment was on the wane.Well, tonight Disney pulled me from that depression, and help reinvigorate my belief in, well, just plain Disney.What we have here is Rapuntzel turned on her head, with a dash of ""Snow White"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" stirred in to keep our interest.The film was charming, clever and witty without being too much of either. The comic timing was toned down for the young kiddies in the audience, mostly little girls and some younger boys, but the comedic aspect itself did not lose luster for this. If anything it showed just what good clever comedy was. Note Rapuntzel's improvised weapon, and how she brings it to bear on the baddies in the local tavern. Classic character sketch comedy, and I don't care if I was the only one who noticed it and was laughing. You're supposed to laugh!The story itself regards fleeing the nest from a ""Mime"" like character, whose interest in our heroine is less than altruistic. The dashing rogue comes in to ground the story and keep Mandy Moore's character from running amuck and falling into despair.All in all, even though a middle aged dude like myself is no where near the target audience, I enjoyed it immensely. Some criticisms; the villainess seemed marginally cliché. She had the liberated 70s woman gone bad thing going on for her, but it almost seems like we may have seen this character before. Not sure, really. The horse was extremely likable, but his rider could have played more of a role. In fact the supporting cast almost seemed as if they were denied screen time so we could revel in Rapuntzel's golden locks. For all that, and even though the action did dive into classic Warner Brother's cartoon territory, ""Tangled"" does make a very respectable showing.That, and it was good to hear the voice of Richard Kiel play a big galoot who turns out to be a good guy. :)My final note is that there was a very good message for young girls at the end, and in fact anyone with some sense will have caught on to it. It's a message that won't last too long, but hopefully will serve as a reminder to those who paid attention. Remember, hair isn't everything. Regardless of color *wink*Take the family, but, if you're the father, then please, PLEASE, do not spend countless minutes like the idiot in front of me paying for his four member family with several credit cards while the ticket taker next to him managed to whiz through four or five parties of several members each for the 7:20 showing at the Redwood City theatre on Theatre Row.Yeah, if you're reading this, you know who you are. Stop being a putz!Everyone else, go see and enjoy the film :)","

"TANGLED","blackmambamark","28 November 2010","Honestly, when is the last time you saw a decent Disney Animated feature? No no, PIXAR does not count. I'm talking about just a regular ol' straight laced Disney flick. If your like me, I'm sure your answer falls somewhere in the mid 90's. But isn't that a shame? What happened to the totally awesome Disney movies? If your excuse is because of technology, i assure you that your wrong. You can make a great animated movie without resorting to actual hand drawn art. But where is that old feeling we all use to share? Well i can tell you this much....i already knew that Disney had something special here, mainly because the VP of PIXAR jumped ship and decided to fund this project. The first time anyone from PIXAR has ever done so, let alone the freakin VP. So needless to say, Disney finally had enough, and pulled out all the stops for this one.I kid you not when i say this....""Tangled"" is easily the best Disney Animated feature i have seen since ""Aladdin"".....yes, it is that good. They finally let go of trying to find something new and different and settled with what was working for them almost 20 years ago. It's a princess tale that easily falls into the same category with the classics. So wait, does that mean i'm comparing it to the likes of ""Snow White"" ""Cinderella"" and ""Sleeping Beauty""? You damn right i am! Sure the storyline is cliché' and relative to other Disney classics, but it felt so good to see and feel something that helped recall your childhood. But other than those minor speed bumps, the movie is spot on. The animation is spectacular, and you would be a fool not to see it in 3D. The musical sequences didn't seem forced and were never boring. And i can almost guarantee you that it will snag the best song award at the Oscars. I'm just glad that they didn't work the story around the music, which is what a lot of animated features tend to slip up on. But this one did an amazing job of hybriding them together.Bottom Line, ladies and gentleman, this is the Disney picture you have been waiting for. It will definitely win your heart and please audiences both young and old.","

"TANGLED","DarkVulcan29","13 December 2010","Flynn Ryder(voice by Zachery Levi) a charming but clumsy thief, who after a heist, and nearly escapes with his life, finds his way too a tower, that appears to be isolated, but it's not, cause an 18 year old girl named Rapunzel(voiced by Mandy Moore) with magical long hair lives there. She strikes a bargain with Flynn, Rapunzel has hidden his stolen goods, and tells him that if he takes her to see a mysterious lights in the sky, Flynn agrees to it, but the question is will they get there?The most fun animation since Shrek and Toy Story. I mean the animation just jumps out at you. And Perfect voice casting, Zachery Levi and Mandy Moore where just too perfect. So was Donna Murphy and Brad Garratt in there roles. I believe this film will be enjoyed for many years to come, by kids and adults.","

"TANGLED","leplatypus","15 January 2011","I liked so much this movie that i watched it two times on screen (my last back-to-back was ""Indi 4""): one with my nephews and the other alone but in 3D and as usual, 3D ins't the ultimate experience (Imax is better) because eyes get used quickly and the colors are darker.I was nearly tempted to name it my movie of 2010 but i prefer a movie with real people instead. Nevertheless, this Rapunzel is the best female character that Disney gives us since Princess Jasmin. To be honest, as much as it's disturbing, i found her very sexy and i wonder if her genes aren't not rated (look for a C. S.). But, looks don't make soul and her personality is as well very engaging: she dreams, she smiles and she cares! I don't know the original fairy tale but i really appreciate the lessons of rebellion and emancipation depicted here: As teens, we are torn between fear of parents and joy of disobeying and the solution is to learn how to say ""no"" to our parents. Here, those moments are showed with wisdom and talent.Finally, my niece was happy because she was lifted by this beautiful pink princess (almost a sister for her) while my nephew got bored because the movie was lacking action and fights! In a decade, i am sure he will change his opinion!","

"TANGLED","maestro-20","25 November 2010","I was apprehensive, to say the least, when I went to see Tangled, after the disappointment that was Princess and the Frog. First, Disney's back with CGI animation, which hasn't really worked that great except, maybe to some extent, Bolt. Second, the trailers made it look really slapstick -- I'm rather wary of today's animation features that try too hard to be hip and fast-paced and silly.I was pleasantly surprised. Sure, there were slapstick and broad humor sure to make little kiddos laugh. But I was surprised by the sophistication as well. The screwball comedy between the hero and heroine is very well done; adults can appreciate that. The sidekicks, in particular the Max and Pascal, are hilarious. The hero and heroine are very likable and not flat. And there's a sense of sadness/wistfulness throughout the whole show that the adults will understand.But what really is great is the animation. This is Pixar-worthy great. In fact, after a while I forgot it was CGI (which tends to be a bit stiff and crude when it comes to character animation). The human characters have that hand-drawn quality even though they're CG. In fact, they're more expressive than the hand-drawn characters in Princess and the Frog. The backgrounds are gorgeous (I can count every blade of grass). And there's an iconic scene where the kingdom rouses from darkness to light with thousands of floating lanterns -- it really is magical. It reminds me of classics such as Beauty and the Beast and Sleeping Beauty.Best of all, the movie is not just all laughs and slapstick. It has heart too. Even the minor characters such as the King and Queen -- you can feel the emotions. And the romance is believable and not cheesy.Like I said, I was very pleasantly surprised. It's something that is worthy of Pixar, and I'm glad to see Disney back on their game. While Princess and the Frog was a missed opportunity, Tangled is almost perfect.","

"TANGLED","sagei","14 January 2012","Not just in a cornball sense. Could have coined the term for this movie. Leaves you warm and fuzzy but also pleasantly surprised that an old favourite can still be so well adapted for a new audience.The silliness feels distinctly contrived. A clumsy nod to Disney tradition.The music often feels equally stilted.In stark contrast to some surprisingly polished and intricate action sequences.The romance provides heartwarming and heartwrenching moments.The cast is superb. They bring the story to life and keep it moving at a fair clip towards a wonderfully satisfying conclusion.Wish them well. Hope to see more like this. Already watched it many times and will watch it many more.Thank you.","

"TANGLED","judywalker2","24 November 2010","Disney is back with Tangled and they have finally found themselves again. First I have to say as much as I loved Tangled it made me sad and angry that Disney could not accomplish the same thing for The Princess and the Frog. Here was there one chance to showcase a Black princess and they missed the mark by a football field. Well so much for that.Back to Tangled. The animation is more than great. The characters are well drawn and thought out, especially the true villain-the old lady. Disney movies are only as good as their villains and heroines; this movie does a great job at both while also giving you a good hero. It is funny and bright, cute and sad. Everyone should spend an afternoon with Tangled. Though the music is not the ""knock your socks off"" great it is good and goes well with the plot. 10/10","

"TANGLED","dylanhook","21 August 2012","Let me start by saying that I'm an 18 year old male, and was kinda dragged into watching this by my girlfriend, who is a big fan of the Disney princess movies. I finally gave in the other day, and I've very glad that I did. The movie looked gorgeous, the animation was spot on; all while holding on to the classic Disney feel. The main characters are extremely likable. Repunzel is your typical Disney princess style character: sweet, funny, etc. Eugene, aka Flynn Rider, kinda stole the show for me, but maybe that's because I'm slightly gender biased. Nonetheless, you can't deny his wit and humor. Maximus the horse fills the role of animal sidekick perfectly; just as good as Donkey was to Shrek even though he doesn't talk. While the plot is relatively predictable, it was still quite an enjoyable movie. I didn't find myself to be bored at only of the parts, and I was laughing a lot more than I had expected to. This movie is an instant classic, and a near perfect example of what animated fairy tales should be like if they want to appeal to a wide range of viewers, not just tween girls. The ending was sweet and should leave everybody happy. I think there's enough fun in this movie for all ages, including an 18 year old guy like me.","

"TANGLED","thekyles99","5 March 2011","Omg how i moaned when the daughter wanted me to sit down and watch this with her as so i finally did and yes i will not complain again about the wonders of Disney! This was such a well put together story by the team of Nathan Greyo and Byron Howard, the same team who brought us another goody from Disney ""Bolt "" They seem to like revolving their stories about young girls who dream of being either stars or princesses. This time they take on the old fairy tale classic Rapunzel with of coarse putting their very own twist on the tale. Disney movies used to turn me off as i just couldn't get by the musical numbers that usually accompanied them however I thank the TV show 'Glee' for turning my taste patterns around, it's not such a bad thing. Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore ) has been held captive due to her long magical locks of hair, in a tower, now a teenager she spends the days trying to keep herself busy amidst her tight surroundings by dreaming of stars and playing with her only friend in life a small chameleon. When a chance and surprising visit from a fleeing thief who only scaled the tower to avoid be captured by the royal guards barges into her life changing it for all the good. A great story that had me , who slowly is becoming more and more of a fan of Disney's day by day, actually wanting more as the 80 or so mins just flew by. Attention to all dad's out there... it's not that bad just give it chance!!","

"TANGLED","neonboy619","26 November 2010","Tangled continues in Disney's animation legacy of timeless classics. Being Disney's first fairy tale outing done in CGI, it's easy to have doubts. The marketing for this film didn't really do Tangled any favors either. Originally titled Rapunzel, the name change to Tangled and the shift of focus onto the male co-star Flynn Ryder in the merchandising was done as a way to try to get more boys into the theater. Despite this faulty marketing move, Tangled is very much Rapunzel's story and Rapunzel is the star of this instant classic. Sticking very close to the roots of the original German Rapunzel fairy tale, Tangled's story is one about overprotective parental figures and the need to want to break free. Mandy Moore voices Rapunzel and sings for her. Yup, this a musical. This is a big grand musical in the classical Disney style with songs by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater. Alan Menken was the one who brought Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and Enchanted to life; to name only a few. Moore really gets to the heart of Rapunzel and truly owns the part, but the real surprise is Donna Murphy as our main villain Mother Gothel. A true hero is measured by it's main villain and Mother Gothel does not disappoint.Every great Disney classics needs supporting characters. What would Mary Poppins be with Bert and the Banks' Children. What would Belle be without the enchanted objects. Snow White is just a lost girl in the forest without those dwarfs.An amazing supporting cast of characters that include Rapunzel's color changing chameleon companion Pascal, the scene stealing horse Maximus, and the main male co-star Flynn Ride accompany Rapunzel in her quest. Pascal and Maximus are animal companions but have more in common with Meeko and Percy from Pocohantas than Sebastian and Flounder from Little Mermaid for the fact that they don't talk. While they are without speech, they are fully fleshed out characters and you know exactly what they are trying to convey with their sometimes hilarious reactions. Maximus was especially a personal favorite of mine. Zachary Levi from the TV show Chuck voices and sings for Flynn Rider and it's easy to see why Disney would choose to up sale him in the TV ads. I would have to say that he's one of the most fleshed out Disney heroes since Aladdin. Tangled is a big grand epic Disney musical done in the classic sense with the modern rendering of CGI animation. This is for sure to be seen for years and years to come and I can't wait to include Tangled in my Disney Collection. I highly recommend this one.http://neonboy619.blogspot.com","

"TANGLED","slcjared","23 October 2010","I saw the finished movie at the screening before the wrap party. The movie works on every level. The Characters, the animation, the story, the score, the romance, and it's all very cute as well (in a way Disney can apparently still pull off). The one thing that I didn't get into was the songs (Except maybe the ""Mother Knows Best"" reprise). They were a little weak melodically and you won't be singing them for weeks like I do ""Part of Your World"" every time I watch the ""Little Mermaid."" However, the songs are good enough not to bring the movie down. There are so many touching scenes in this movie and you will love all of the characters by the end and have an amazing time in the process. It is definitely worth seeing in the theater, as this is probably the prettiest computer animated movie I've seen. I just can't wait to see it in stereo!(BTW, I'm a 30 year old male who grew up with Disney. And I feel like I'm being objective when I say this movie works as a movie and not as a movie exclusively for 10 year old girls.)","

"TANGLED","jergasmic","24 November 2010","I was very sketchy walking into this movie. I didn't know what to expect, it's Disney which is promising, but it's also Disney's first CGI Disney movie that got a PG rating, so it seemed different. It was pretty hard for me to choose between 'Tangled' or 'Burlesque' but I'm glad I made the decision to watch 'Tangled'. This film has everything, for everyone, boys girls and tongue in cheek humor for adults. It's Disney's answer to Shrek, but in a classy way, that doesn't feed off of pop culture. The story of the film is simple. Rapunzel is a princess that has hair that has power to heal and keep people young, but once it's cut, it loses all power. When Rapunzel was just an infant she was kidnapped by an old woman who locked her away in a tower to keep her hair all to herself. Rapunzel grows up thinking that her kidnapper is in fact her mother, and the reason she's locked away is because her 'mother' wants to keep her safe from the hardships of the world. I'd tell you more about the movie but I don't want to ruin it. Let's just say she runs away. Very simple, fairy tale plot.I was kind of saddened that Disney has succumbed to making Princess movies using CGI, but watching this movie I realize that some scenes wouldn't have the power it had, if it were in 2D. The lantern lighting scene, for example, was amazing. It wouldn't have been the same in 2D. The music, was perfect. Enough musical number to keep Disney fans more than satisfied and not enough to where it's overkill. The songs were heartfelt and meaningful, they all served a purpose, it wasn't just a nameless song thrown into the movie. The voice acting, by Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi were amazing. I was a little sketchy about Mandy. I'm a long time fan, but I wasn't sure if she had the right voice to be a Disney Princess. She gave Rapunzel so much life, and innocence, I couldn't think of any other actress who could play her better. Zachary gave Flynn life, and humor, and made him a very likable character. However, the two characters that stole the show were Pascal, the chameleon, and Maximus, the horse. Although these supporting characters have no speaking lines, through actions and emotions, you know exactly what they want to say, and the message comes in loud and clear. This movie has enough action and comedy to keep boys happy and enough emotion, romance and drama to keep the girls happy. There are a few scenes that made me tear a little, well maybe more than a little. Some scenes have so much emotion and depth that it tugs at your heartstrings, and gives you goosebumps, especially the lantern scenes. Disney is testing the waters of their film making with this one. There were many alcohol references and even references about being drunk. There's violence, people getting stabbed, and yes, even blood. Which you never see is Disney movies. Overall, I highly recommend this movie, to everyone. Anyone could enjoy this movie. It's very hard not to like it. With theater prices so high, I suggest you don't spend 10 dollars to watch Cher and Christina, but watch 'Tangled' instead. They don't make movies like this anymore. It's much better than last year's 'Princess and the Frog'. Rapunzel is now in the line-up of classic Disney princess. I cannot stress how amazing this film is. Go out and see it.","

"TANGLED","misterembryo","29 November 2010","Rather than your ordinary Once Upon a Time, the story of Tangled starts with a voice-over from Flynn Ryder, our egotistical antihero, warning you that this is a story about how he died. This American Beauty style prologue is a clear indication that although it's a Disney movie, this story is not without the darkness of Grimm. As Disney's 50th animated feature film, Disney freaks and general moviegoers alike will be pleased to find that Tangled is worthy of the golden hallmark. It's beautifully animated, full of surprises, and really funny. I'll even go so far as to say it has the power to jerk a few tears.Disney decided to go with an alternate title instead of sticking to the original Rapunzel. It works because this imaginative retelling seems to be a little more than a story about a girl with long hair. It's also a story about an old woman consumed with a fear of dying. Her name is Gothel, and she's the figure that sets all the action in motion by kidnapping the baby princess at birth. She did this because she's aware of the magical properties that lay hidden in our heroine's golden locks: sing a special song to it, and you can live forever.Gothel hides Rapunzel away in a tower, raises her as her own, and forbids her from seeing the light of day, urging the world is an evil place. This is creepy within itself, and among all the Disney villains, Gothel is by far one of the creepiest, reminiscent of the mom in Stephen King's Carrie, from the scary way she keeps her daughter sheltered down to the scary way she is ultimately defeated.Gothel at least had the decency to provide Rapunzel with a library of books. This has kept Rapunzel occupied for all the 18 years she spent in isolation, and has made her apt at a range of activities some of us may never learn: painting, paper mache, charting stars. Still, she longs to see the world, if only to find the source of the floating lanterns: mysterious lights that fill the sky every year on the night of her birthday.Flynn Ryder's not your average knight-in-shining armor. He's more like Gaston in a Han Solo costume. Poor Flynn is in enough trouble as it is, constantly hounded down for stealing a prized possession from the royal family. Aside from the palace guards, Flynn has to deal with twin goons that resemble Jason Stathem and a tenacious police horse. Next thing you know, Flynn is stuck with a teenage girl in desperate need of rebellion.Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi provide the speaking and singing voices for our two protagonists, and do a phenomenal job. The voice acting is pitch perfect, just like the music composed by the legendary Academy Award-winning Alan Menken.I can't wait to see Rapunzel at Disneyland, not just because she's smoking hot, but also because it'll be entertaining to see eight guards following close behind to accommodate her long head of hair. The 260 million dollar budget makes this the most expensive animated feature to date. Considering the magic it will bring to households 50 more years down the road, Tangled is worth every penny.","

"TANGLED","iloveUGA123","11 January 2012","I absolutely loved this movie!! Disney originally tried making another princess movie a few years ago, Princess and the Frog. That movie was not good at all!! Disney is known for their amazing princess movies, and that was not one of them, and I have know idea what happened with that movie! Now that Disney has made this movie, they are back on top with their incredible princess movies!! The music was wonderful, and the movie was a little different from their usual princess movies. This one was funner and more modern, but they still had the whole princess feel to it, which is what Disney is known for! Disney's other movies, that don't have music, and aren't a princess movie that have been coming out over the years are good too. They just haven't made a princess movie like this one since The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, etc. I would definitely watching this movie, no matter what age! Especially if you grew up watching their princess movie, I absolutely know that you will love this movie!","

I took the grandkids today to see this movie and they loved it, as did I. The 3D is worth going to. There is enough silliness, adventure, and romance to allow boys and girls of almost all ages to love this show. There were some funny lines in the show that kids would not understand, but adults would enjoy. I heard a gentleman laughing throughout the whole show. I am not around teenagers, so I am not sure how a teenager would respond to this show. The storyline was different but predictable. That should not discourage anyone from going to this show. I would rate it as one of the best, if not the best animation show I have ever seen. This show is a winner as a family show.","

"TANGLED","SGuy157","5 January 2011","I will start off by simply saying that this movie is excellent. No, the word excellent doesn't even describe this movie well enough, because it is better than excellent. I could not take my eyes away movie for the hour and a half of the film. Even if the movie was seven hours long my eyes would still be glued to the screen for the whole time. Along with Up, this has to be the best animated movie ever made.The animation was outstanding, and I was amazed at all of the little details in all of the characters, objects, and backgrounds in every frame of every scene. The film is full of breathtaking and amazing images. The scene with all of the floating lanterns was one of the most beautiful things I have seen in a movie. Nothing could have been done to improve the amazing visuals and animation used.Before first seeing the movie, I hadn't realized that it was a musical, so that was a pleasant surprise for me. I have heard people say that the movie was great while the music was only average or not that good. I, on the other hand, thought that the music was wonderful and fit perfectly with what was happening, whether it be the action and fighting scenes or the calmer scenes like the lantern scene.Also, this movie actually made me laugh, and I don't laugh much during most animated movies. Personally, I thought that the dialogue was great and all of the characters worked well together. I especially loved the relationship with Rapunzel and Flynn, because it could be comical at one point and then touching at the next. And not only was the dialogue be used for comedy, but it also was used to create beautiful and touching scenes. Even thinking about the line were Flynn told Rapunzel she was his new dream and when she told him that he was hers gives me chills.I really hope that this movie gets an Oscar. True, Toy Story 3 and How to Train Your Dragon were both outstanding movies, but I think Tangled is the most deserving in the animated film category. Every aspect of the film was perfect. The animation, the story, and the score all were excellent and when combined they made a movie that couldn't have been better.Congratulations Disney, you've got me tangled. I wish I could see it again, but unfortunately I think I'll just have to wait until it comes out onto DVD. I hope to see more movies like this in the future.Oh, and by the way, I'm a guy. A teenage guy. So really this movie should appeal to all audiences. If you love a good movie that is charming, funny, beautiful, and touching, then go see the movie Tangled. You won't be disappointed.","

"TANGLED","valen060","6 December 2010","Before I begin the review, I must say that Disney has made quite an accomplishment in making this the 50th animated movie in their history since ""Snow White"" back in 1937! What an era that was! As for the movie, changing the title to ""Tangled"" from ""Rapunzel"" does indeed reach out well with its young audiences. The cast was well-selected, the animation was complex, yet brilliantly crafted, and the song arrangements felt traditional in terms of what the past Disney fairy tale-based films had done before, which captured my attention and kept me interested even more. After all, Mandy Moore did a stunning job providing the speaking and singing voice of Rapunzel herself. The song titled ""I See the Light"" was very noteworthy among them all since I felt a similar, positive feeling as I did with Aladdin's ""A Whole New World.""I wasn't bored in the least on the storyline, it made me want to see more as the plot began to develop even further. At one point, I couldn't help but feel sorry for the two main characters' (Flynn and Rapunzel) inner struggles and how they really feel about one another, but that's exactly what I was hoping! Growing up among Disney's most memorable canon animated films throughout its history has been something I've followed since I was born (the late 1980s). I have seen all of the previous 49 animated movies and ""Tangled"" has definitely made itself worthy to reside in its rightful place as the official #50! THIS is a must-see and I think I'll be looking forward into seeing it again and again whenever I choose!","

Then I just knew how was it gonna be... what a beautiful movie! what a great characters! As many of you I'm gonna sound repetitive but... it surely worths it... Disney's classics are back. And there's no Pixar in here... no mates, that was all Disney! What we have here is a real Disney Princess (not like that sad intend to go back in time with The Princess and The Frog), a real one. With a dream, with a lovely voice, and no boundaries! Who wants to go beyond and beyond... and what is most important... she takes us with her! I felt there inside from the very beginning until the end. And of course without adding the fact that there's unexpected parts: no one can say that the end (you know what I mean, not to spoiler you) was expected... TOTALLY AWESOME! (when I've got here in fact I felt like you all were reading my mind!!! All of us where in the same theater, in front of the same screen the whole movie).

"TANGLED","dutchs-1","22 January 2011","I'll never get this magic stuff. If you put a magic flower under a basket, won't it die from lack of light? And if you use it to save the queen in childbirth, why will the baby have magic powers? And why her hair? That's why I flunked out of Hogwarts. But what a fun film. Rapunzel is not just beautiful, she's seriously cute. And unlike the saintly Snow White and Cinderella, she's got a marvelous streak of spitfire in her. There's hilarious slapstick and barbed dialog. The villainess is classic Disney wicked stepmother, smarmy and selfish, whose physical beauty only serves to accentuate the evil within. She meets a most satisfying demise. The lighting of the lanterns, Rapunzel's whole motivation for leaving her tower, is breathtakingly beautiful. And on a technical note, this film got a writeup in Scientific American for advancing the frontiers of animation. Previously, extremely complicated motions of hair or clothing became rigid because the algorithms couldn't handle the complexity. The animators solved that problem. Also, a flood scene is the most lifelike CGI water I've ever seen. My only complaint, which made me consider giving the movie a 9, is that wicked stepmom has a couple of tedious musical numbers that the film could have omitted with no loss.","

Maximum was hilarious. A horse with a mind of his own that can do quite a number of 'stunts'.I would highly recommend this movie not only to adults but for young children as well. It's fast, exiting and very entertaining.I didn't find any parts to be 'slow going' and it certainly put a new slant on the old story of Rapunzel.A real 'feel good happy' type of movie.","

"TANGLED","cbluvsact","9 January 2011","I have seen this movie 3 times as of today, and possibly 4 as of next week, if that gives anyone a good idea of what a fantastic movie this is. Tangled is now my favorite of the 50 Disney animated movies out there, or any animated movie for that matter. Despite fans of the classic Disney princess being down on the CGI animation, I to the contrary found that this was a vast improvement. The scenery and basic concepts were still classic Disney, but the CGI made them movie vivid and realistic but in a cute animated way. The characters were all very deep, and all added their own humorous aspects to the movie. Repunzel was a bad ass without being violent, and more lovable than the rest of the princesses combined. The prince was actually a bandit role (Flynn) and way more dimensional than previous princes. He was a main part of the movie, and he added a great contrast to Repunzel's naive heroine. I left having a crush on Flynn, and wanting to go to the pet store to buy a pet chameleon. I predict that at the end of the movie you will leave feeling lighter at heart, and transported back to being a wide eyed youngster. Well, I did anyway.","

All the characters even look stock Disney except for one major difference, this movie is in 3D. And, boy what a difference that makes. Each character exhibits the entire spectrum of faces and emotions, the visuals are amazing and the use of lighting makes for some really astounding visuals.Who really steals the show is the horse Maximus. He doesn't say a word but he's funny, sympathetic, brave, noble and heroic all with just physical expressions. The other characters are equally well done. I really think this movie marks a significant achievement in Disney's animation and makes me excited about Disney movies in a long time. I highly recommend this movie to see the Disney magic done right.","

I'm not a big song guy..... but the songs in this movie are very good. Either very funny or, when the love songs begin, nicely done with some good lyrics and music. It's a '10' all the way across the board. In keeping with the Disney animators reputation for hiding phallic symbols, this has maybe the most blatant one of all. When the mother is standing near the window, her shadow is unmistakably harder than Chinese arithmetic. Keep an eye out for it..... But, this movie really is well done. The song and visuals in the tavern with all the thug characters is pretty funny. Definitely see this one!!","

Everyone simply loved it. The 3-D effects were noticeable and wonderful. We got a kick watching our 4-year-old raise his hands as if to catch some of the action float off the screen. There were tears, and much laughter, as is Disney's style. The story of Rapunzel is very well told here, with great villains, heroes and wonderfully entertaining scene-stealers, like the non-verbal horse, Maximus. The music is very theatrical and very typical of the usual Alan Menken genius (Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Little Mermaid, etc.). This movie is very entertaining for adults, and the kids will absolutely go crazy for it! Treat your family this season to a great movie! You won't be disappointed.","

They moved in to the 2000's Atlantis, Lilo and Stitch, Treasure planet, Brother Bear, Home on the Range, Bolt.Last year they had a great movie of the Princess and the Frog.And now they tried with the well-known fairytale of Rapunzel!And it worked beautifully. Disney is now going back to it's original roots of doing creative story-telling. As Walt Disney aspired and created to do. Walt Disney himself even tried to create a compelling story for the story Rapunzel but it never took off (Similar to the little mermaid)And many years later the Disney company decided to take it of the shelf and give it another go. And they succeeded.Rapunzel is a smart, artistic and Naive girl who is locked up in the tower all her her life. Always wondering when will her life Begin..... Turning 18 she dreams to see the ""Stars"" that appear every year on her birthday. But her Mother, Gothel refuses to let her go outside for Rapunzel's Safety. Stuck in the tower Rapunzel still wonders what life is like out there.But through lucky circumstances a charming thief wonders into her tower. Surprised, Rapunzel seizes this chance with him and makes a deal for him to take her to see the Stars.And so she and Pascal flies out of her tower to explore the new world around her. There are no pop culture references and is not bound to the laws of reality. (Such as people questioning about the weight of her hair....)People always compare the music to Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Little Mermaid. The music might not be as memorable. But it is still beautiful music and Alan Menken (Who did A lot of the Disney renaissance music) Did a Great job for it. It helps to set the mood.The animation is beautiful! Excellent detail, fluent movement of the characters (Maximus especially and the massive effort to do Rapunzel's Hair).The villain Mother Gothel might be just a villain but she is more complicated than any other Disney villain. In the film you can question if she loves Rapunzel as an Object or as a real daughter.Rapunzel in other hand is a great female heroin. Loving her mother so....and does what she says. But eventually explores outside of her tower and when she finds the truth she does not take it lightly. In the film she's the one calling the shots, not the male protagonist. The story was great and you can connect with the characters. (But I think the climax should have a bit more action in it) The story is Disney Generic but that's why we love it.....If Tangled is successful enough they might combat the story of ""The Snow Queen""","

"TANGLED","Hitchcoc","7 September 2017","Everyone knows the story. The girl, Rapunzel, with the golden hair, kept up in a tower. She is only visited by one person who controls her. Of course, unless she were headstrong, nothing would happen in this film. And, of course, she is. Also, we know that to fulfill her dreams a guy is going to show up. This time, however, the rules get changed a bit and the formula is broken as well. I didn't gravitate toward this one as much as previous Disney films, but it was still very good. I think the title is great. I think the plot moves along at a nice pace and Rapunzel is quite interesting. Once again, the animation is superior.","

Mother Gothel sees the flower and hides it; then she finds that when she sings to the flower, she rejuvenates. Centuries pass and a kingdom is raised in the place where the flower is hidden. When the beloved Queen is about to have a baby, she gets sick and the only hope to save her is to find the magic flower. But Mother Gothel does not want to share the sun's gift and keeps the flower hidden. However, the spot is found and the magic of the golden flower heals the Queen. When the Queen's daughter Rapunzel is born, she receives the healing power from the flower and Gothel abducts her to use her magic hair to stay young. Gothel raises Rapunzel as a daughter, without cutting her hair and locks her in a height tower in an isolated area. She keeps Rapunzel far from other people, telling that it is for her own protection. The King and the Queen celebrates the anniversary of their beloved daughter releasing lanterns to the sky, and Rapunzel dreams on leaving the tower to see the floating lights from the outside world. When the thief, cheater and liar Flynn Rider steals the crown with two bandits, he is chased by the royal guard. However, he double-crosses the other thieves and flees, and climbs the tower to hide. However, Rapunzel hits him with a frying pan and hides his satchel with the crown. Rapunzel promises to return the satchel if Flynn takes her to see the lanterns. He accepts the deal and they start a dangerous journey of discoveries and love chased by the guards, the bandits and Mother Gothel. ""Tangled"" is a delightful animation based on the fairy tale by the Grimm Brothers. The story is wonderful for children and also for adults, and I loved the sequence when Rapunzel makes peace between Eugene Fitzherbert and Max. Join your family, bring the popcorn and have a great entertainment for 100 minutes running time. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Enrolados"" (""Rolled Up"")","

"TANGLED","mattyschreck","29 January 2011","Yes, this is a ""typical"" Disney movie, with singing heroes (and heroines) and villains, saucer-size-eyed characters, cutesy animal companions, and a coming-of-age plot. However, it's also a Pixar movie (genius John Lasseter was Executive Producer) meaning that it is hilarious in most scenes, heart-stoppingly beautiful in the visuals, wittier than 95% of all the other movies out there, and definitely something that can be loved and enjoyed by both little kids and their parents. The plot really has nothing to do with Rapunzel, apart from a woman being imprisoned in a tower, who has (very) long hair. The story Disney has come up with is probably one of the most beautiful they have ever crafted. A princess is abducted by an evil witch while she is still a baby, and grows up completely sheltered by the witch, who needs her magical hair to stay young. Every year on the princess' birthday, the distraught king and queen let beautiful lanterns rise to show her the way home. Of course, the princess, now almost 18, has no idea what they mean but knows that they are important, and wants to see them from up close. A young thief who stumbles upon the tower is just the right companion for her to get out, and from there the plot develops with never-before-seen speed in a Disney movie: just like we are used from Pixar. I don't have kids, but I loved watching this movie in a cinema that was filled with them - as soon as the adorable animal companions (a horse that acts like a dog, and a chameleon very much the same as the cockroach in Wall-E) fell over, the kids were screaming with laughter. And then they would make one of those cleverly animated faces that only adults can understand, and I had to laugh. There are other scenes that will forever stick in my memory: how Rapunzel transforms a tavern full of evil ruffians into a singing mob of people who follow their dreams, how the use of a frying pan in one small scuffle becomes the weapon of choice for a whole kingdom, and more than anything else, when the lanterns are being lit and released into the night sky. I'm a 33-year-old male, but I have to say: that brought tears into my eyes, it was that beautiful and moving.I don't really understand why this movie hasn't received more attention. I used to be a very strong Disney fan until the company became weird (Pocahontas and later), but having watched Tangled, I can honestly say that this is easily the wittiest, fastest, and possibly even most beautiful Disney film I have ever seen.","

"TANGLED","petit76","28 November 2010","I was very sketchy walking into this movie. I didn't know what to expect, it's Disney which is promising, but it's also Disney's first CGI Disney movie that got a PG rating, so it seemed different. It was pretty hard for me to choose between 'Tangled' or 'Burlesque' but I'm glad I made the decision to watch 'Tangled'. This film has everything, for everyone, boys girls and tongue in cheek humor for adults. It's Disney's answer to Shrek, but in a classy way, that doesn't feed off of pop culture. The story of the film is simple. Rapunzel is a princess that has hair that has power to heal and keep people young, but once it's cut, it loses all power. When Rapunzel was just an infant she was kidnapped by an old woman who locked her away in a tower to keep her hair all to herself. Rapunzel grows up thinking that her kidnapper is in fact her mother, and the reason she's locked away is because her 'mother' wants to keep her safe from the hardships of the world. I'd tell you more about the movie but I don't want to ruin it. Let's just say she runs away. Very simple, fairy tale plot.I was kind of saddened that Disney has succumbed to making Princess movies using CGI, but watching this movie I realize that some scenes wouldn't have the power it had, if it were in 2D. The lantern lighting scene, for example, was amazing. It wouldn't have been the same in 2D. The music, was perfect. Enough musical number to keep Disney fans more than satisfied and not enough to where it's overkill. The songs were heartfelt and meaningful, they all served a purpose, it wasn't just a nameless song thrown into the movie. The voice acting, by Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi were amazing. I was a little sketchy about Mandy. I'm a long time fan, but I wasn't sure if she had the right voice to be a Disney Princess. She gave Rapunzel so much life, and innocence, I couldn't think of any other actress who could play her better. Zachary gave Flynn life, and humor, and made him a very likable character. However, the two characters that stole the show were Pascal, the chameleon, and Maximus, the horse. Although these supporting characters have no speaking lines, through actions and emotions, you know exactly what they want to say, and the message comes in loud and clear. This movie has enough action and comedy to keep boys happy and enough emotion, romance and drama to keep the girls happy. There are a few scenes that made me tear a little, well maybe more than a little. Some scenes have so much emotion and depth that it tugs at your heartstrings, and gives you goosebumps, especially the lantern scenes. Disney is testing the waters of their film making with this one. There were many alcohol references and even references about being drunk. There's violence, people getting stabbed, and yes, even blood. Which you never see is Disney movies. Overall, I highly recommend this movie, to everyone. Anyone could enjoy this movie. It's very hard not to like it. With theater prices so high, I suggest you don't spend 10 dollars to watch Cher and Christina, but watch 'Tangled' instead. They don't make movies like this anymore. It's much better than last year's 'Princess and the Frog'. Rapunzel is now in the line-up of classic Disney princess. I cannot stress how amazing this film is. Go out and see it.Evren Buyruk from USA","

"TANGLED","neil-476","4 February 2011","Tangled is advertised as Disney's 50th animated movie. In many respects, it is also the first - the first movie to tell one of the traditional fairy stories (in the way that the classic animated tales, starting with Snow White, did) using the classic type of Disney character design, but to do so using CGI and 3D.I thought this film was great. It looked like a classic Disney movie, but with the CGI lushness which today's audiences have come to expect. The slender story of Rapunzel is fleshed out nicely with additional story elements, none of which betray an audience expecting a traditional fairy story, and it races along, full of excitement, action, humour, suspense and emotion. And yet there is sufficient in the way of modern sensibilities that a 21st century audience will not feel adrift.The characters are extremely well realised. All the supporting characters are fun (particular the animal sidekicks and the den of thieves), and the three main characters are exceptionally well done. Villain Mother Gothel is splendidly duplicitous, often funny, great looking, and wonderfully voiced by Donna Murphy. Flynn Rider is a lovable rogue straight out of the textbook, but with sufficient character not to be simply a cardboard cut-out. And Rapunzel herself is beautiful, and heart-achingly human in facing the dilemma of doing what she is driven to do while facing the fact that this is a betrayal of her mother's wishes (essentially the same dilemma Ariel faced in The Little Mermaid, but realised far better - and I thought Mermaid was a nearly perfect film!).The songs are satisfactory, but Glen Slater is no Howard Ashman - the lyrics are good, but they don't sparkle.And did I mention that this film looks fabulous? Every aspect of the visuals is perfectly realised, and looks simply stunning. The 3D is ever present but not intrusive. It enhances - sometimes significantly, but not to the extent that the film is poorer for its absence.If I may get a bit spoilery, there is an element towards the end which reminded me of both Beauty And The Beast and Shrek - one of the characters displays an unexpected element of self-sacrifice and, in so doing, cuts off an escape route, following which something wonderful happens and all ends well. In each of these cases I was aware of being emotionally manipulated. But, by gum, it works! My 9-year old companion was wiping tears away, and so was I, even though I was expecting the miraculous turn-around which followed.I loved this film.","

"TANGLED","the-movie-guy","19 November 2010","(Synopsis) After receiving the healing powers from a magical flower, the baby Princess Rapunzel is kidnapped from the palace in the middle of the night by Mother Gothel. Mother Gothel knows that the flower's magical powers are now growing within the golden hair of Rapunzel, and to stay young, she must lock Rapunzel in her hidden tower. Rapunzel is now a teenager and her hair has grown to a length of 70-feet. The beautiful Rapunzel has been in the tower her entire life, and she is curious of the outside world. One day, the bandit Flynn Rider scales the tower and is taken captive by Rapunzel. Rapunzel strikes a deal with the charming thief to act as her guide to travel to the place where the floating lights come from that she has seen every year on her birthday. Rapunzel is about to have the most exciting and magnificent journey of her life.(My Comment) Tangled is the retelling of the Rapunzel fairy tale. Disney's storytelling version is fantastic and the animation was just spectacular. Rapunzel's long golden hair looks incredibly realistic, and all the characters in the movie are cute and extremely lovable. The animals involved as part of the story were given great personalities (even though they did not speak a word), and the horse Maximus stole all the scenes he was in. There are many tender and touching scenes throughout the movie. Disney's usual touch of magic makes this movie a home run. The movie has romance, humor, and action that will please a wide range of audiences. Both children and adults will enjoy this new Disney classic. (Disney Pictures, Run Time 1:40, Rated PG) (10/10)","

"TANGLED","insomniac_rod","23 May 2011","Yes, ""Tangled"" is that good. It offers great humor, funny situations, endearing characters, great musical moments, spectacular animation, and a high entertaining factor. It takes the classic fairy tales to a higher level because the central character is clever, fun, and knows how to defend herself.The Rapunzel story is re-booted according to the exigences of the new millennium. No more of a stuck up girl with zero ambitions. This girl is brave and can kick ass.I laughed out loud in many scenes. I looked in awe thanks to the 3D (the starts looked spectacular).This is the best Disney movie in years. Period. It is magical, touching, has a message, and can be enjoyed by all ages.","

It is a movie that kids should grow up seeing and believing that life really is that good. My sister loved it so much she sings it all the time and she is only 3 years old! It has become her favorite movie and I know she has learned good things from it. This is her singing to it. It can help to create a roll model for kids and can teach them about never giving up on your dreams and about how the world really can be a beautiful place even though there is still bad. here is a video of my sister singing one of the best songs from the movie. ain't she adorable? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOUQUdZrmpg","

They lost that heart, magic and soul that once made them the rulers of animation. Move to 2008 and Bolt brought a ray of hope. Then in 2009 The princess and the frog marked their return to fairy tales. Enter 2010 with Tangled a fantastic movie that has all the elements to be a classic and a great movie for years to come. The story is very simple yet the movie never loses it pace. The animation is gorgeous and the music may not be epic but is everything you can expect from Alan Menken. In overall a great movie worthy of all the attention it can get. Lets hope that Disney continues this way.","

"TANGLED","wovendesires","26 November 2010","First let me say that I am not usually the one who give reviews to movies, but this one I felt was necessary. When I went to see Disney's Tangled, I really wasn't expecting much. The previews I saw hadn't appealed to me enough, but a group of friends went to see it and I was dragged there. To put it in simple terms, it was amazing! Not only were the characters believable, but the relationships between them were as well, especially between the hero, heroine and villain. The design was very detailed and beautiful; I personally loved the scene with the lights -if you've seen it, you know what I mean. As for the score, I feel it went back to the classics like ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast""; the songs were very much like the movies when I was growing up, when Disney was the number one choice for kids. Although in my opinion, Tangled didn't manage to bring a song as memorable as key songs like ""Part of your world"" or ""Beauty and the Beast"", I can't take the ""Healing Song"" out of my mind.All in all, I believe it was a wonderful movie. It felt like Disney from the good old days. I guess it's a farewell note to all of us who grew up with Disney as they head out of the 'Princess era' and bring forth their new 'boy-oriented' movies. In all true honesty, even though I'm a 25 year old male, I am one who loves the classics, and don't find any interest in movies like the ""Mars needs Moms"" that was announced before the movie started. It's movies like these that made Disney so popular, and even though I understand why they decided to make this change, I feel that what Disney should focus on is bringing more movies like Tangled: with enough story, great characters, a pinch of heart and a general feeling of hope that makes Disney what it has always been: a place for kids to hope and dream.","

"TANGLED","benladams","16 November 2010","About two minutes into the 3D version of this film, I turned to my friend and said, ""this is AMAZING."" And it really is. The depth of color and the quality of the details are simply stunning. But the beauty of the animation wasn't the only good thing about the movie, just the most obvious. The storytelling was fantastic and fast-paced, weaving an age- old fairytale with a modern reinterpretation of surrounding events. What really makes the film, as far as the characters go, though, is the personalities that Disney assigns to the animals involved. None of these animals ever utters a word, yet they easily steal the show with their clear human emotions and comedic timing. This is definitely a film I recommend, even if you don't have children.","

"TANGLED","Jerique","28 December 2010","In the last few days of 2010, I got to see one more final movie and seal the deal on what I think is the best year of movies in over a decade. It was Tangled! I'd see the trailer of the re-imaging of this particular fairytale and thought it'd be cute with the comedic ""she's been grounded...like... forever."" I was also drawn to Tangled for the reason of being a big Mandy Moore fan. However, I did not expect it to be a musical nor to have Alan Menken (a top favourite composer of mine) to be the film's composer.Beyond being a great score with a few catchy tunes, I did find myself getting annoyed whenever Rapunzel (Moore) would break into song. It was great at first and Donna Murphy's ""Mother Knows Best"" song was great too. But after that, I was kinda hoping for just a regular movie. It was timed great and the animation worked really well to create the horse Maximus and the chameleon Pascal into comedic roles without speaking.Throughout the entire film, there was not one point where I was disappointed in it or felt that it was awful. I thought the rating of the film was perfect because although it's a kid's film, some of the romance is more aimed for teens and an older audience than a six year old. It's a great film for the year and I think it's one of the best animated films ever to be created. I highly recommend this one.","

"TANGLED","mmmincr","27 November 2010","Ever since I saw the previews for this movie, I've been dying to see it. But after having viewed it, it far exceeded my expectations! The characters were completely lovable, especially the chameleon (Pascal) and horse (Maximus), they provided laughs throughout the whole movie, the evil characters were also developed very well. The animation was breathtaking, especially of Rapunzel's hair as well as the lanterns released into the sky (It was absolutely gorgeous!!). I have read other reviews saying that the songs were not so great, but I found them very entertaining. In this movie, the songs do not take such a huge role as in other Disney movies, but they are nevertheless very catchy and well done (I still have them stuck in my head). I would recommend this movie to everyone (all ages), I was in the theater with toddlers who were entertained the whole time, and I even brought along my mom who is in her 50's and she loved it! There is never a dull moment, and you'll find yourself laughing the whole 90 minutes. The romance of Flynn and Rapunzel seems utterly real, due to the wonderful animation and the talented voice actors. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the fact that I can't have a cute little chameleon like Pascal for myself!","

"TANGLED","gonewithscarlett","25 November 2010","I saw Tangled yesterday in 3D, and let me just say, I'm glad I did. When I entered the theater and saw a HUGE line, I immediately noticed that every person in the line was under the age of nine. Now, while I was a little embarrassed, I was still too excited to see the movie to care that much. Tangled's heroine, Rapunzel, is a typical Disney princess. When I say that, I don't mean like Cinderella or Snow White, waiting for her prince to come and get her. I mean like Ariel, Belle, or Jasmine. She's curious about the world, headstrong, passionate, beautiful, and, of course, sweet and kind. Oh, and she's a girl that knows what she wants--to see a spectacular light show in person. But Rapunzel is stuck up in her tower with her mother, Gothel. Now, as the movie shows us, Rapunzel doesn't mind the tower all that much. She really loves Gothel, and she's kind of scared of the world outside. All she wants to do is see thousands of lanterns lit and launched into the sky, which she watches from her window every year on her birthday. This seems like a pretty reasonable request to me. But Gothel doesn't want her daughter to leave the tower for her own selfish, vain reasons (that you have to watch the movie to find out about). So poor, lonely Rapunzel seems doomed to spend the rest of her life trapped in a tower, watching and waiting for someone to come along and save her. And someone does come along! The swashbuckling thief, Flynn Rider, steals a crown and runs for cover before the palace guards can arrest him. He just happens to end up in the secluded spot of the forest that Rapunzel's tower is in. He gets one glance of her hair, then is knocked out with a frying pan and shoved in a closet. After coming to, Rapunzel bargains with her prisoner. She'll give him back the crown if he guides her to the lanterns, then takes her home. Flynn agrees. The music in this film isn't quite up to par with Disney's best (Circle of Life, Part of Your World, etc.), but since it was written by Alan Menken, it's definitely good enough to get into your head--and stay there. The song ""When Will My Life Begin"", sung by Mandy Moore as Rapunzel, is my personal favorite. The pop/country style is modern but fits the story, and the tune is catchy. The other songs are ""Mother Knows Best"", ""I've Got a Dream"", and ""I See the Light"". While Rapunzel and Flynn Rider are great characters, I have to say that a certain Maximus the horse stole the show for me. The speechless character's facial expressions and quirky mannerisms are hilarious. He seems to hate Flynn, but he later proves how lovable and loyal he really is. Pasqual the chameleon also provides some comic relief, but the one to look for is a short, drunk old man wearing only a diaper and wings. He has very limited screen time, but he always says something hilarious. I saw this film in 3D, which, although beautiful, probably wasn't a very different experience than it was in 2D, except for one scene towards the end, when Rapunzel and Flynn are surrounded by thousands of glowing lanterns. It was breathtaking. I rate Tangled a 9.5/10. It's creative, visually astounding, and possesses that Walt Disney magic that is so hard to find lately. But don't just take my word for it. Spend the money—you won't regret it. P.S. I originally wrote this review on my new blog (througharabbithole.blogspot.com), so I'd love if you'd check it out! This is my only post so far, but more will come.","

"TANGLED","pat_nasi_buzz","12 January 2012","Taking place in a land far, far away, Tangled tells us about an evil witch named Gothel. By consuming a special flower, she was able to live forever. One day, the queen who ruled that land couldn't give birth, so she needed a special flower in order to have a baby. The king ordered his servants to trace the location of the flower, and gave it to his wife. In short, the baby was successfully born, but Gothel got angry and decided to take revenge, so she kidnapped the baby, aiming for her magic hair which she could use for eternal life. Rapunzel, the baby, grew up with her fake mother's (Gothel) lies, telling her that outside the tower was full of dangerous things. There was a handsome thief who managed to steal the Princess' tiara. He hid in Rapunzel's tower and then they met for the very first time. Mother Gothel tried to separate them but she failed. And the two of them finally saw the floating lantern, which was her biggest dream ever.Rapunzel is in an active yet wishy-washy girl, but she has a good heart. The thief, Flynn, is a handsome, playboy, and attractive guy. Mother Gothel is an antagonist. She loves Rapunzel, but is too obsessed with her hair.At first Rapunzel and Flynn didn't a smooth conversation and they didn't trust each other. As time went by, they fell in love. The conversations encourage for the viewers to support their dreams.The moral of this story is if we a have a dream, we have to make an effort and attempt to achieve it and never give up.Despite knowing the fact that it's a movie with an happy ending, we still watched it and we enjoyed it because of the excellent animation, good songs, and last but not least, because of Rapunzel herself is very entertaining; the long hair itself attracts us.","

"TANGLED","Whowantsliquor","17 November 2010","I had the pleasure of seeing an advanced screening of the movie back in October, and I was not at all disappointed in any way! Don't let the trailers and marketing fool you; this movie is anything but a Shrek rip-off like the trailers would lead you to believe. The movie is a straight-up classic animated musical along the league of The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and Beauty and the Beast. Not only does the film stick close to the original Rapunzel fairy tale, it also improves upon it by adding the Disney magic we all know and love, and that's gorgeous art, music and heart (and perhaps some twists in order to make the movie family-appropriate, as we wouldn't want an out-of-wedlock pregnant Disney heroine).The villain in the movie (Mother Gothel) is a very devious and selfish being, and perhaps the most complex Disney villain next to Frollo. In all, I love her and I think she is very unique! The protagonist, Rapunzel, is a very welcoming addition to the Disney princesses we all know and love. Her best friend, the chameleon Pascal, is hilarious and adorable! Flynn Rider is a smug guy, but charming nonetheless. The horse Maximus steals the show in most of the scenes he's in. In all, the characters in this movie are all extremely lovable! Not to mention the amazing story, visuals, and plot. If anything, this movie would be the one that starts off the new Disney Renaissance, and I'm saying that as someone who watched and loved both Bolt and The Princess and the Frog. I'm a teenager who grew up on classic Disney movies and this film definitely deserves to be one of the five best animated Disney movies ever made!","

Viewing some trailers for tangled it looked like it was going to be a funny film but was the trailers packet with the best bits? With a big smile on my face I can honestly say read on :)When the screening started 3D glasses at the ready for us all, the Sony dog I think is great and hoped that Tangled would be more like this where you could reach out and grab things, fingers crossedFrom the start I was hooked and from the absolute silence in the cinema it seemed everyone else was too. For the next hour and a half I was taken on a none stop roller coaster that just kept getting better. The 3D was amazing and at one point my son really did reach out to grab something out of the film . The story is fantastic with every character capturing your imagination and throwing you into the film wondering what's coming next . A Disney film wouldn't be a Disney film without a bit of singing and dancing and this film has just the right amount , this coupled with the already great story leaves me to think it will become one of the Disney classics it really was brilliant.I would recommend going seeing this, it put a smile on my face and my son loved it, its one of the best films I've seen for ages that we could all sit and watch together.Review by The Local Explorer","

The voicing was very good. It has an awesome story and a unique retelling of a classic tale. The film also had a very bright and colorful look, enhancing the feel-good vibe. The floating lanterns scene was simply awesome and mesmerizing, actually. Absolutely beautiful!I enjoyed every single character in the film. I felt the king and queen's sadness, still looking for their lost child years after she was kidnapped. There were some sincere, emotional moments. The horse, Maximus, was my favorite character, and I simply adored the chameleon, too! I want a horse like Maximus! I literally loved every minute of this film.The original songs were incredible, with clever, appropriate lyrics. ""Skip the drama, stay with Mama."" Ha-ha, so funny!! The only issue with the film was the inconsistency of the length of Rapunzel's hair, but I'll forgive them for the sake of convenience for the character to move about more easily.

However, just like many other films (unless it's outright lame and boring), I gave it a benefit of doubt by watching a second time and somehow my impression of the movie improved. And after watching it for the third and fourth time, I realized that I had actually missed out so much on what this movie has to offer.On the surface, it may look like another fairytale with a twist in it. But open your hearts and put yourselves in the shoes of the characters, and you'll see a whole new perspective.Plot: A beautiful story of a going-to-be-18-year-old bright and cheerful girl (just like the sun), who has never met a soul and has never been out of the tower before, and yet still dreams and hopes that she could someday realize her dreams while watching the lanterns in the sky on her birthday every year. 10/10 Characters: Rapunzel and Eugene are a perfect match and Pascal and Maximus are also their unbelievably compatible 'sidekicks'. 9/10 Visual: It is recommended to watch this in as high definition as possible and if you can watch it in 3D, please do so. Best part (and probably highlight of the whole movie): the scene where the lanterns were released and both Rapunzel and Eugene(Rider) are in the boat. 10/10 A movie not to be missed no matter what age (unless you hate fairy tales).","

"TANGLED","eschetic-2","28 December 2010","A few years ago the technical wizardry of SHREK trumped the superior story telling of MONSTERS, INC. at the Oscars, and this may be one of those years. Early buzz has the wistful mixed bag TOY STORY 3 with a lock with Oscar voters who long for their lost childhood despite the monstrous children they show in that film, but the FAR more enjoyable experience, while still not without flaws of pacing, is Disney's deliriously enjoyable semi-musical (wonderful even if surprisingly unobtrusive score by Alan Menken) rethinking of the old Rapunzel legend, TANGLED.The funny and yes, actually sexy animated leading man and his innocent but capable leading lady anchor a near perfect animated cast. The cavalry horse Maximus who starts as the hero's chief nemesis and winds up his best ally is a brilliant comic creation nearly matched by Rapunzel's faux ""mother,"" a 21st century version of the classic wicked witch. While some of the most popular recent animated features have generated major and minor sequels, this is the first animated film in my experience where I'd love to see these animated characters AS DRAWN and VOICED reused in other, not necessarily related properties as if they were real actors. They're so much fun to spend time with, you want to spend more. If Disney had the good sense to try an animated version of George Bernard Shaw's perennial success ARMS AND THE MAN with the same animated cast they've already developed, I'd be willing to bet it would be just as big a hit.Great cast, but also a great story told with amazing freshness and insouciance. By elaborating on the well known story of the maid in the tower to create a classic quest to center their refurbished story around, the film makers also opened the door to a dazzling array of fresh comic touches (I'm with Flynn - ""I gotta get me one of these!"" - in loving the possibilities of the rediscovered old kitchen and comic standby, the cast iron skillet) and amusingly twisted sub-characters (yes, even one momentarily covered with the comic rodents that have been a Disney good luck talisman for years) with ""dreams"" similar to but different from Rapunzel's and thus touched on something universal in all of us. We all have dreams that seem unrealistic, but with determination and faith may not be. TANGLED has its heart firmly in the right place as pure entertainment so that it's only afterward that we realize how strongly it was encouraging us in the audience to follow our own dreams, but the joy and the beauty that washes over us while watching it remains with us to inspire long after the credits (which, sad to relate, are the one unimaginatively filmed part of the movie and easily missed) roll.Of course the more and more ubiquitous new 3D system works beautifully and makes the motion picture experience more than it will inevitably be on the small screen, but the story telling is so good, that when the DVD inevitably comes out, it is one which will have to be on my shelves for regular reviewing whether or not we have 3D technology on our home screens yet.When the ""previews"" are as good as TANGLED's, you usually think they must have pulled ALL the best parts, but this is one case where a film lives up to it's hype. It really is one of the few ""must sees"" of a pretty good year at the movies. (Sadly, as of January 25, 2011, it appears my prognostication re. TOY STORY 3 was prescient: the Academy chose to only nominate THREE animated films - including the inferior ""How To Train Your Dragon"" as ""Best..."" - in the apparent fear that TANGLED might actually beat TOY STORY 3 as it has at the box office. Inexcusable.)","

"TANGLED","zkonedog","4 March 2017","The hallmark of Disney animated films (at least of late) has always been their ability to combine humor with heart to produce an entrancing concoction of family entertainment. Simply put, ""Tangled"" succeeds once again in that vein.For a basic plot summary, ""Tangled"" tells the basic story of Rapunzel...but with a more modern feel to it. Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) lives in a tower with Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) and forbidden to leave. One day, however, the dashing young Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) happens upon the castle and changes Rapunzel's life forever.Humor-wise, this flick will have young and old alike laughing out loud. Since it is told from the modern perspective (e.g. Rapunzel acts like a current teenager, nothing is ""stuffy"" about the tale, etc.), there is plenty of room for conversational humor and sight gags galore.Also, a very interesting animation choice produces big results: the decision to make the characters' faces/eyes as wide/expressive as possible. The film is already a visual treat (Blu-Ray highly recommended), but the emotion (and this movie is full of it) strikes a real chord in large part because of those facial features.Overall, I very much enjoyed ""Tangled"" and would highly recommend it to fans of similar Disney or other animated fare. For years I skipped this effort because I thought it little more than a ""girls movie"", but when watching it with my younger sister it was ME getting emotional...not her!","

"TANGLED","aaronjbong","29 November 2010","The Disney Renaissance period was grand to the Disney company. They had made many 2D animated musicals that had turned into all-time classics such as ""The Lion King"" or ""Tarzan"" which are based on stories, legends or maybe fairy tales. But, after 1999, things changed as the movies are no longer based on fairy takes or other stories but rather original ideas. But, 2010 will see the return of animated musicals with ""Tangled"" with the addition of 3D animation and 3D format.""Tangled"" marks the return of animated musicals and will be based on the fairytale of Rapunzel. But, Disney added some changes and new characters and also removing some things from the original tale into a new tale. It's basically about Rapunzel, a girl who has incredibly long hair with magic powers. When she's still a baby, Mother Gothel kidnapped her forth magic powers and so, Gothel took care of Rapunzel and concealed the truth that Rapunzel's parents were actually the king and queen of the empire.Unexpectedly, Flynn Rider, a mastermind thief now known as a fugitive was on the run and saw Rapunzel's tower, he climbed up the tower and met Rapunzel. Then, they began to form a relationship and so it becomes a problem for Mother Gothel then, they have fights and so on.""Tangled"" is actually a great film to begin with. It is enjoyable mostly to girls but it also has an appeal to boys. Jokes here are plenty and everything was really good. The voice performances were also magnificent. The songs in this film are classical. They are really enjoyable for kids and are memorable . There are many songs here but the division of the songs is quite uneven having Rapunzel owning over 65% of all the songs. The 3D effects if the film was also satisfying enough. It was quite in depth and the lanterns part in the film was really breathtaking. I was happy enough with the 3D effect. However, there is a prominent difference from previous animated films which is the length . Mostly range from just 80 minutes to 100 minutes. But, ""Tangled"" is actually 110 minters ling instead, very long for a children's movie. ""Tangled"" is actually a very good film. I would recommend it to everyone and their kids because this movie is truly remarkable. Even though not Disney's best movie, ""Tangled"" is definitely worth seeing it.Prince AJB's Rating: 90%Thanks for reading my review on ""Tangled"". Hope it's useful!","

"TANGLED","hellraiser7","20 May 2014","It has been far too long since we seen another animated fantasy film that Disney is best known for. As a person that has watched these kinds of films since childhood my patience was seriously getting tested. This is one of my favorite animated films because it really helped bring back the old Disney films I knew and loved.The animation is just superb, you can tell the animators were just at their A game, and the effort shows. From the background really capturing a sort of post medieval pre Renaissance era, as well as just the look of the forests and everything in it. However what impresses me the most is the character animation.The songs are hit or miss, that's what you get for most musicals. The one song that stands out for me and I feel is the most memorable is ""At last I see the Light"" which is just beautiful, it is a song of course about the romance between both Flynn and Rapunzel but also about discovering your dreams.However it's the story and characters I really love the best. Supporting character Maxamus is great, he's sort of like Duddley Do Right's horse. Like in that cartoon the horse seems to be doing a better job at exercising authority than Duddley. And I really like the buddy dynamic between both Flynn and Maxamus, there is always something really fun and touching about seeing two characters on different sides of the fence working together and bonding, we see both of them giving each other grief but also getting along and both do come though and work together.Rapunzel is great (voiced by underrated actress Mandy Moore)she's beautiful inside and out, sweet, funny, has just great charisma, energetic, and ambitious. I just love how much of a free spirit she truly is, despite being locked up in a tower most of her life her spirit will always be free. And she is a bit reluctant at times which is normal, but I like that she does go on and becomes more confidant in her actions which is something I can emphasize with. And also she's she is able to hold her own against danger.It's interesting just seeing her use non cleche items, from a frying pan which surprisingly becomes useful as a weapon though out the whole film, hey there's no weapon store/pawn shop nearby to buy a sword so it makes sense. But I really love how she uses her hair which is just amazing, you would think anyone with overlong hair would have trouble walking. But here Rapunzel we see her use to it and it's interesting seeing how well she managed maneuvering without any trouble. Her hair is indeed very useful, from acting as a lasso but most importantly she has a magical ability which is her hair is able to glow not just to light the way in the dark, but to heal fatal wounds.I even like how she seems to have this blissful affect on most people, like in that scene with the Vikings in the bar, it was kinda funny how her charm got them to reveal themselves for not being just stereotypical brute but people with dreams and needs like ourselves. But she's a character also a character that you do feel sympathy for, from the back story which is pretty sad, she's practically been a slave/prisoner most of her life unknowingly; so years of Rapunzel's life have been stolen from her let alone time with her real parents. It's just not right, that all the more gives us reason why we want Rapunzel to win, she's was meant to live free and meant to have real love in her life.But of course my favorite character is Flynn Rider (played well by Zachary Levi) he sort of reminds me The Prince of Theves character from the TV show ""Hercules the Legendary Journeys"" like that character he's a real con man whom is pretty much looking out for number one and trying to get rich quick. Is a bit shallow since he has a bit of narcissism but in a harmless sense. This is the kind of guy whom would probably be one of the last choices to save the princess but he had the luck of the draw, and hey not all heroes are perfects but sometimes to me their the best kind. He's got great charisma which is fun, clever and funny, just has some of the best lines in the film.I also like you even feel a slight sense of sympathy for him, because Flynn isn't entirely all cheerful he's been alone most of his life so he's kinda lonely; but worst of all he has no real dreams because he doesn't really know what he wants in his life let alone what he was looking for; despite how many things he stole he still has nothing. But that's because he's been looking for the wrong thing.I love the chemistry between both Rapunzel and Flynn, it's funny how both of them give each other grief. But then both of them after a long while open up to one another and warm up to each other. I like how both of them bring out something inside each other they never felt before, for Rapunzel it's a sense of adventure and freedom but for Flynn it's unselfishness and warmth. Both are right for each other you know Rapunzel's place isn't in the tower but with Flynn and Flynn has finally found what he was looking for.If the film has a message it's about not being afraid to make you dreams come true, do everything in your power or what is necessary to make it possible. But most importantly to never stop dreaming and pursuing them.Just like Rapunzel hair this film glows.Rating: 4 stars","

"TANGLED","preppy-3","30 December 2010","Disney takes the tale of Repunzel and makes a few changes. Repunzel (voice of Mandy Moore) is taken away from her royal parents at an early age. She was kidnapped by Mother Gothel (voice of Donna Murphy) because Rapunzel's long golden hair helped keep her young (it's complicated but the movie explains it). She keeps Rapunzel in a tower warning her to NEVER go outside. Then robber Flynn Ryder (voice of Zachery Levi) gets into the tower and gets Rapunzel out. Then a series of fantastic (but fun) adventures take place.First off I should mention I saw this in 2-D NOT 3-D (I refuse to pay $15.50 for an animated feature). Still I LOVED it. It's Disney's first (I think) GCI feature and it works beautifully. The characters look real and the settings are incredible. It's like one of the best Pixar features. The script is fast and funny with jokes that mange to appeal to the kids AND adults equally. The voices match the characters expertly and I got a BIG kick out of Flynn Ryder (obviously modeled after Errol Flynn). There are also two CGI animals--Pascal (a chameleon) and Maximus (a horse)--that are hysterical! They don't talk but their facial expressions alone had me laughing out loud! It IS PG for some (very mild) violence but I don't think it would bother the kids. The little girl sitting behind me couldn't have been more than 6 and it didn't bother her at all! It was fast, funny and full of adventure and humor! I was never bored for one second. A 10 all the way!!!","

The movie rolls with enough action and activity to keep the kids on their toes, and to keep their eyes on the screen the whole time.The 3.5 year old never once asked to go home in the middle of the movie, as she has for other movies. That may be her growing up a little, but a lot of it was the superb pacing of the movie.","

And, not to mention, the animation was absolutely stunning! I watched this film three times - once in 3D - and if you want visual brilliance, please see it in 3D.The animation - incredible.

"TANGLED","zactac","12 October 2011","While some may not be familiar with the name ""Disney Renaissance"", it was a sort of Disney Golden Age starting with The Little Mermaid in 1989 and ending with Tarzan in 1999. The last ten years has mostly been nothing short of the type of animation you would find on Disney Channel or Toon Disney (now DisneyXD). Disney, for some strange reason, had lost it's creative ability but now these last few years has set the pace for Disney's redemption. Pixar is what has saved Disney's film industry but now thanks to the new Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter, who also worked closely on many Pixar movies, Disney is finding themselves making movies that in a few years time will rival Pixar. Now The Princess and the Frog began this new Renaissance Era and it seems to continue with Tangled.Now this is also a different rendition of the classic fairy-tale. In Tangled Rapunzel is kidnapped as a baby and hidden in this tower by an evil woman. Her hair actually has some kind of special power that makes her so coveted. Now Rapunzel is growing up and doesn't want to stay in the tower any more. When a thief hides in the tower she knocks him out and hides his prize. She makes him promise to take her out of the tower for a day and then she'll give him back what he wants. Of course something will happen between the two and there is always this climatic battle between good and evil. But I was surprised at how much I liked it. I found the characters real and charming. The songs were definitely catchy and I can still hear them in my head to this day.There has been much controversy over how the film was made. At first I was skeptical about leaving behind the use of animated drawing but the use of computer animation was maybe the better idea. They make the animation come to life and it pulls you into the movie and that's without the story or characters.Now as for the story that was, once again, another controversy proved to be a good idea. The filmmakers take the story to new heights and even asks questions only a Pixar film would dare to ask using animation. Mandy Moore (Rapunzel) and Zachary Levi (Flynn Rider) are perfect as the leading characters. They bring humor as well as wit to roles in the most unexpected ways.Tangled isn't just another animated fairy-tale, it is a statement that Disney is back on there long-awaited top form. The title might be Tangled but Disney's return is as straight-forward as it gets. They've made their statement ""we're back and that is that."" And I can't wait to see what else they bring to the table.","

Although these supporting characters have no speaking lines, through actions and emotions, you know exactly what they want to say, and the message comes in loud and clear. Music was great and the animation was so good and it was like everything was in place properly. This movie got everything what one should expect. For me 10 on 10. Worth your money folks.

"TANGLED","dvc5159","10 December 2010","I was quite skeptical of this because I thought the Golden Year of CG- Animated films ended with a not-so-big-bang with the decent ""Megamind"". After a year which brought you ""How To Train Your Dragon"", ""Toy Story 3"", ""Despicable Me"", and ""Legend Of The Guardians: The Owls Of Ga'Hoole"", can there really be any other CG-Animated films of that caliber?""Tangled"" miraculously continues and ends that streak (at least for this year alone) with a big bang.There is nothing wrong with liking a movie which is out of your personal tastes. Yes, ""Tangled"" may look like a typical kids film on the poster, but I am glad to say that this film is a strong return to form for Disney Animation Studios.Even if it is CGI and even though the film bases itself around another fairy-tale princess, it is done very well. It is made clear that everyone involved in the film cared about the material and wanted it to reach out to everyone. They succeeded brilliantly. Everything that you loved in an animated Disney film is here in full force. Disney has never been this good since the 90's. Pixar is excluded - they're in a world of their own.Take for example, the characters and actors. Rapunzel looks cute and adorable, Flynn looks handsome and dashing; and the villains look menacing. Yet, underneath it all, the voice actors bring out the dimensions in the characters. A very versatile Mandy Moore makes Rapunzel a sweet and innocent girl yet one who is full of adventure and determination. Flynn, voiced by ""Chuck""'s own Zachary Levi, shows dry wit and vanity at times, and also self-actualization later on in the film. The other voice actors do their part just fine, especially Donna Murphy as Mother Gothel - a selfish and cruel new addition to the Disney villain club.While the story/screenplay was written well for what it's worth, the music by Alan Menken truly displays his signature Disney trademarks, the grand music, the catchy songs, the emotional ballads in the middle. I'm not surprised if it gets an Oscar nomination at the very least, knowing Oscar.Well, there, I've said it. I really enjoyed ""Tangled"", its extremely like-able main characters and it's fantastic visuals enveloping a classic fairy tale, it is a real welcome return to form for Disney, and I really hope it continues to go down this way. This one is a definite must watch for the families, a new ""Princess"" classic for Disney.Overall rating: 75/100","

"TANGLED","TaylorYee94","15 October 2020","Disney is known for a good-hearted, beautiful, and gracious princess rescued by the prince at vital moment. While it was prince helping and leading the princess out of the danger in the past Disney, Rapunzel and Flynn Ryder support each other and walk together into the adventure.In previous Disney, the prince could not catch up with princess' charms maybe because the story focuses on princess' narratives and the audience gets to hear her side of story throughout the movie. However, In 'Tangled', Flynn Rider is one good-looking lad with nice smolder, soft voice, and love for Rapunzel. This movie provides the backstory of Flynn so the audience can form the bond with him. They are most compatible, full-of-chemistry, and sparkling couple among all princess and prince.Moreover, 'I See the Light' is the most underrated disney song. Lyrics, melody, a beautiful settings with floating lights, looks on their faces.. everything is just perfect. Finally, I want to point out the setting. Corona is the most colorful and warmest place, and the lighting is the critical factor of all.","

First of all, I'd like to state that it looks amazing from the gorgeous colours to the well textured hair. The hair was one of the animaters' finest achievements in this movie, because that's one of the hard things to do in animation.The songs were okay, I See The Light was the stand-out while the others were well performed and served their purpose even if they weren't among my picks for the best songs by Alan Menken.The comedy was actually my favorite part, because there are so many hilarious passages in here, and they weren't mostly the spoken jokes, because hands down Maximus is the funniest character from Disney in a long time, maybe since the 90's!So to sum it up, a fresh take on the well known fairy-tale princess formula with stunning animation and lots of fun for the whole family are guaranteed.","

My six year old sisters love the movie, but me and my twenty year old friends absolutely adore it. Tangled is the perfect blend of modern movies and the old princess features that we all know and love. It has something to offer to everyone. The care that went into making this movie is also greatly appreciated. The trailer threw me off at first, and I still believe that the trailer was Disney's biggest mistake. In the effort to appeal to younger audiences, it made the film look cheap and thrown together. I assure you, this is not the case.

"TANGLED","cjd-16","24 November 2010","Despite the modern-sounding title, ""Tangled"" is perhaps the most classical-styled Disney film since the days of Disney himself.What really makes this movie feel like a classic is that it digs back, way back, all the way back to Disney's roots, back in the days where the most common main character that you saw in every Disney movie was along the lines of ""A completely innocent main character discovers the world."" I'm talking Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, and Bambi. And now we can add Rapunzel to this list, because this is what Tangled is really about: Rapunzel finally stepping out of her tower after 18 years of experiencing absolutely nothing but her little room at the top, and seeing the whole world in wide-eyed wonderment. To some degree, this makes Tangled feel even more ""Disney"" than even the stellar films of the 90's Disney Renaissance. We fall in love with Rapunzel right from the beginning because we want her, such a kind and loving character, to live her dreams and find beauty in this new world she is experiencing. This aspect of the film is absolutely brilliant. Rapunzel is almost like Snow White in her kindness, and yet she also actually has a real personality! I can't say enough about Rapunzel's character. She is easily near the top of all Disney princesses, mixing the love and kindness of Snow White with the realism and believability of Ariel and Belle.From a visual standpoint, this is definitely a throwback to the classics as well. The colors are vibrant and lively, and the buildings warm, rounded, cozy, and inviting, as if they themselves have been custom-chosen to convey the sense of wonderment that Rapunzel feels, like she is a child visiting Fantasyland at Disney World for the first time. This adds greatly to the tone of the film, and combines to make the whole world of this movie feel lush, romantic, and inviting. Because of this, the whole thing is a joy to watch even in its imperfect moments. There are some especially amazing scenes, most notably the floating-lanterns scene where the whole kingdom slowly lights up little by little until the whole thing looks like it is glowing from the inside. (It will no doubt be remembered as the ""iconic"" scene from this movie, like the ballroom scene from Beauty and the Beast.) Pretty much, nothing about this movie is ""negative."" It has very strong main characters with some really well-done complex relationships amongst themselves, great sidekicks, some good-natured humor, a great classical song-filled musical score that has had me humming it for the last two days, and the plot is staged without a single thing feeling boring or clichéd. And in that manner, I believe that this is the first Disney film in nearly 15 years that can truly be called a Disney classic.On the film-geek side of it, there is some amazing technical wizardry going on here. This is the best CGI hair ever put on film thus far. For the first time, we have computer-generated hair that can truly be called ""beautiful."" It shines, it stretches, and has weight that just looks right. Plus just getting the world itself to look warm and inviting is a huge accomplishment, as CGI is generally much more inclined toward producing hard mechanical edges. Great stuff! IMO, this is the biggest step forward in animation since ""Tarzan"" introduced deep-canvas technology.One other thing that makes this movie just like the best Disney classics is that it works on all levels. For the adults like us, there is some great thematic subtlety going on beneath the surface, touching on classic coming-of-age themes, mother-daughter relationships, and in Flynn's case, how often the over-confident ruffian is really just hiding personal shortcomings and really doesn't know what he wants. Plus the characters really feel like real people, and never just archetypes or caricatures. And for the kids, there is some really good-natured humor that doesn't talk down to them, a great romance story, and the film was near-perfectly-paced, with not a moment of the running-time wasted, and yet still taking time to breathe to let us see some of the acting ""ticks"" that really let us get into the heads of the characters.The only reason I am giving this a 9 is because of some minor contrivance nitpicks that keep this film just below my favorite Disney movies. The only one that I feel is really worth mentioning is the excessive use of cartoon physics. Flynn and Maximus fall off a 100-ft cliff and emerge completely unscathed. Flynn is catapulted from a wheelbarrow over 50 feet through the air and lands perfectly on a horse. And that horse then jumps over 30 feet off of a rooftop and keeps running unphased. That bugged me, and made it feel slightly like this film was taking place in a cartoon universe rather than the real world like most Disney movies, taking away slightly from its credibility. Also, there was something that kept it from feeling as ""complete"" and ""epic"" as almost every Disney movie feels, but I can't quite put my finger on why. But ultimately, these things were all minor in the grand scope of things. This was really a character-driven movie rather than external-plot-driven, and the characters are absolutely amazing.So in one department, I felt that this was as much a classic Disney movie as any ever made, and near-perfect. Due to some slight contrivances, I feel like the physical plot was a step below Disney's best, but in general I feel like Tangled is the first Disney movie in over 15 years that can truly be called a masterpiece. I actively loved almost every second of it, and immediately wanted to go back and see it again. In a world populated by movies that are either too silly or too serious, ""Tangled"" is a bright ray of sunshine that is a joy to watch at every second.","

This movie was phenomenal on every level. The characters were amazing and Zachery Levi as well as Mandy Moore voiced the characters fantastically. They seemed very human and the animation was awesome. I went to watch a few other movies that day as well and this is the one movie that stuck out the most. It made me happy and is a great pick me up. The only criticism would be the musical numbers. They could have been worked on a little more but I still loved it and think its a great kids movie as well as adult movie. GO WATCH IT!","

"TANGLED","jakehadlee","31 January 2011","As the father of young girls, I get to see more than my fair share of animated movies and am used to them falling into one of two categories - either quite entertaining and well put together or excruciatingly bad. I can now a third category - brilliant.This is a wonderful piece of film-making, let alone animation. The story has superb pace, a strong narrative and genuinely engaging characters. It's funny, touching and gripping - and it looks wonderful too.Of course it has the usual stock Disney characters (feisty, independent princess, cheeky animal sidekick, comedy villains, evil mother figure etc) - but, here's the twist: they actually pull it off this time - the funny characters are funny, the leading man is charming, the princess is hugely likable.I know Toy Story 3 will win the Oscar - but I'm amazed this hasn't been nominated. TS3 fell into my first category for me (entertaining and well made) but was essentially a rehash of the themes from TS2 and was neither original nor any better than its predecessors. Tangled is simply a better film on almost every level.Tangled is the first animated film I've seen since Spirited Away where I came out the cinema thinking I'd seen a great film, not just an entertaining one.","

"TANGLED","ronjoan68","3 January 2011","This is the best Disney film I have seen. This film is superb on every level. The story is imaginative, well-told, beautifully constructed and perfectly paced. As is a Disney trademark, the music was beautiful, inspiring and woven magically and meaningfully into the story and dialogue. The lyrics were extremely clever and witty. The genius of Alan Menkin (music) and Glen Slater (lyrics) amaze me. When I got home, I immediately went to the internet to learn more about the voices behind Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) and Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy). Their singing were theatrical and outstanding. The voicing and acting were imaginative, moving and fit the story, the characters and the moment perfectly. What more can I say ? As expected, the animation was top notch Disney. Each scene was a spectacle. I'm not that emotional but I think my jaw dropped when I saw the lanterns being launched into the sky. That scene and the context in which it was shown actually brought tears to my eyes it was so beautiful. This is a movie that will appeal to all ages. I want to see it again and can't wait for the DVD. Go see it. You will love it.","

"TANGLED","Likes_Ninjas90","10 January 2011","Disney's fiftieth animated feature is an appropriation of the Rapunzel fairytale. We are told that a magic flower was found to cure a sick queen as she was giving birth to her daughter Rapunzel (Mandy Moore). Gothel (Donna Murphy), an evil old woman, learnt that the healing power of the flower was embodied in Rapunzel's hair. Gothel kidnaps the baby Rapunzel and locks her in a tower for eighteen years, telling her that she is her real mother and ensuring that her long golden hair is never cut to preserve the powers. Every year on Rapunzel's birthday her parents prepare a light show, hoping that she will return. Rapunzel wishes to see the lights for herself and asks her Gothel if she can be let out of the castle. Gothel dismisses the request, stating that it is too dangerous. Meanwhile, a thief named Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) is being hunted for stealing a tiara. During his escape he stumbles upon Rapunzel's hidden tower while Gothel is out. Rapunzel knocks him out and hides the jewel. When he awakens she promises to only tell him where it is as long as he takes her to see the lights in the sky and he reluctantly agrees. As Pixar have worked to bridge the gap between animation and more humanist narratives, Disney has returned to an old fashioned and exaggerated brand of filmmaking. Tangled feels like the sort of film that Disney would have made back in the early 90s. It's driven more by playful, slapstick humour and action rather than a multilayered plot. Yet the two main characters (voiced very enthusiastically by Levi and Moore) at least have some consciousness about their identities. Rapunzel's ethical dilemma stems from being an adolescent girl on the verge of adulthood. She is divided by feelings of excitement and anxiety to explore the real world. Rider's own identity is eventually revealed to be as fabricated as hers too, lending some minor but welcome variations to the standard Disney coming of age tale. The film is also a musical too but thankfully there are just a few of these needless numbers. Unless you are a fan of Mandy Moore's singing voice these songs just seemed dated. The lyrics are just a little too cute and clean, rather than memorable and edgy. Tangled is showing in 2D and 3D but the former showcases the film at its most luminous. The visual scheme is continuously bright, making strong use of the primary colours and enriching the film's expansive, green landscapes. In the final quarter of the film there is one sequence that is so charming and quietly beautiful that it will eventually become a signature image of Disney pictures. Interestingly, the film's very warm and cute feel is in many ways representative of Rapunzel's optimism. The colour found when her feet touch the grass for the very first time is contrasted with darker tones to the aesthetics as the danger becomes more immediate. This is no more prominent than in a surprisingly fearless and emotional climax. If the rest of the film had taken more chances with its tone and narrative, Tangled would be far more than what it is: sweet family entertainment.","

"TANGLED","tedg","30 December 2010","Sometimes the inner narrative is clear.The outer narrative is fine enough to sell tickets to parents, thinking this is what their kids want and their kids returning the favor. You'll have to read elsewhere for how well this is done. What fascinates me is how obviously we can see what concerns the animators.This is marketed not as a film in its own right, but as the 50th Disney animation. It is easy to see it as such, as a narrative about the artists.Our heroine starts the film with her obsessive two-dimensional drawings, quite literally cartoons like the initial Disney era. In these is a depiction of an event that we discover is her dream, her wish. Following the princess formula, which Disney invented, we hear her ""wish song,"" about this dream. The dream is fulfilled in ""paintery 3d"" as the main story.By the end of the film, we are reminded that her memories and the projected cartoon of the entire film has been painted on the walls of her space. There is literally a moment where they start to merge. But in between we have the layer of that cartoon in the ""real world,"" meaning the three dimensional world of the current animation technology. In that layer, we have the quest for the three dimensional experience: the losing of the lantern kites on an anniversary.When this came for me, I was overwhelmed. This was partially because the ""fold"" worked for me; The watched cartoon was on the walls and the real world was the one I shared with the characters. Disney first did this (to my knowledge) in their dinosaur movie where the ""cartoon"" was in cave paintings.The ""lights"" was an extraordinarily well done adventure in framing, editing and camera angle selection. There is no Pixar influence here — this is all homegrown Disney and now that Pixar is worn out, we may see a new generation of animated cinema here.Another reason it worked for me is the simple geometry of romantic imagination. Connection is spatial, extreme spatial experience where the senses and sense are overwhelmed. The lantern scene effectively did that for me and I admire its manipulative construction. This is very much an adult movie and very overtly sexual. The source images are in a space created by a sexually manipulative woman, managing a hidden fecund valley in which an overtly phallic tower houses our future stories.So it is extremely easy for me to see this as a story about animation, folding and sex. Pure in each regard. It is not about love. It is about drawing love, and much more romantic as a result.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","

"TANGLED","austin-takahashi","18 January 2012","Walt Disney Animation Studios has regained its touch and reclaimed its glory. After a decade of churning out animated flicks that only served as a shadow to the works of Dreamworks, they have finally created something that deserves a place in my heart. Yeah, I agree how the latter part of my previous sentence was covered with cheese. But that's how the movie made me feel – Cheesy. I developed affection for its characters, and I felt the loss in its tragedy. Also, I released a couple of blushes towards its romance. As the loveless chap that I am, I'm usually unaffected by mushy moments in movies, but not this time. ""Tangled"" is just too darn adorable. Let me share with you a quick story. My childhood was blessed beyond grace, for it was nurtured by a loving, gentle woman: my mother. As amazing as she is, we abide by the truth that nobody's perfect, and my dear mother had poor discernment when it came to animated movies. She was numb to the genre; identifying animated characters as nothing more than plastic objects. So you could tell that I was filled with delight when she informed me that she had enjoyed ""Tangled"". The makers back at Disney must have done something incredibly right. I mean, even I had a special fondness for the movie, where most of it is directed at its young princess. If Rapunzel ever gets thrown into the real world, like Amy Adam's Giselle in ""Enchanted"", I'll be the guy to catch her. And now this movie review has extra cheese.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/tangled-movie-review/","

"TANGLED","bob the moo","16 August 2020","Back when this came out I had no children, and while I did occasionally watch films aimed at children, I had no specific need to do so. Some ten years later and Disney and Pixar are much more regular in my viewing schedule, which is what led me to watch Tangled - a film I was only slightly aware of, and remembered hearing that it was not as good as other similar films. This may well be true but actually Tangled is a solidly enjoyable film throughout. The plot is broadly the Rapunzel story, but done with energy, fun, and towards the end a little of bit of touching material. As a narrative it is simple and easy to follow - which is important for children as I learnt while watching Frozen 2 and trying to figure out the messy plot and explain it simply at the same time.The animation is smooth and polished, but not to the point that it lacks character. Speaking of characters, I enjoyed all of the main ones and they were engaging and did more than the basics. The best songs are upfront and the second half of the film is noticeably lacking in numbers, but the keys ones are catchy and well written. On the whole it is a solidly enjoyable family film which is easy to follow, has a good plot, good songs, and decent laughs/adventure.","

"TANGLED","AlsExGal","5 July 2020","I loved this movie. It is the story of Rapunzel, a princess with magic hair that has the ability to heal. Rapunzel was kidnapped as a child by an old woman who wanted to stay young. She kept Rapunzel captive in a tower in the middle of nowhere, where the two of them lived for 18 years. When the old woman would start experiencing the effects of aging, she'd ask Rapunzel to sing a special song while she brushed Rapunzel's hair. Rapunzel had to sing the same song each time to activate her special powers. Every year on Rapunzel's birthday, her parents, the King and Queen, release two lighted lanterns into the sky, hoping that Rapunzel would see them and come home. Eventually everyone in the kingdom began releasing the lanterns, creating a beautiful ""starry"" sky. Rapunzel sees these glowing lights every year and wants to see the display in person. Enter Flynn Rider.Rider, a criminal, stumbles across Rapunzel's tower while on the run. He manages to climb inside the tower. Eventually after Rapunzel is understandably freaked out, she makes a deal with Rider: He must take her to the castle to see the lanterns released, and she will give back his satchel (that she's stolen and hidden) that contains the items he has stolen. Inevitably, the two fall in love and Rapunzel's ""mother"" is upset that Rapunzel is gone and seeks out to find her.This was a great movie with fun characters and fun songs. My favorite part was when Flynn takes Rapunzel on a romantic boat ride so she can view the annual lantern display from the best spot in town. The scene is so gorgeous, accompanied by a romantic song. I'm a sucker for sweet romantic stories, even if they are animated. But none top Shrek.","

"TANGLED","hans_0108","24 February 2011","This movie was one i actually really wanted to see. I have missed that little bit of Disney magic i adored as a child. So myself and a group of friends all decided to go indulge in some fun.Now we are all 16 and probably should know better but we waltzed into that cinema unashamed as parents piled in with their children. The film had us mesmerised. From the start we were aww-ing, aah-ing and laughing. It seemed we were the only one's enjoying the full experience, which actually disappointed me, as no one else seemed to be openly touched by the film.I am sure the whole audience did enjoy it, however, maybe we were more vocal. The astoundingly intricate characters were beautifully voiced and animated. Even some of our favourites, Pascal and Maximus, who couldn't speak were just amazingly animated to such a degree that it was crystal clear what they were thinking. They had our row howling with laughter as did the mischievous Flynn Rider who i loved for his rogue-ish quirk and hysterical relationship with Rapunzel, our heroine, who could also hold her own very well. I don't want to spoil anything but her choice of weapon in danger is somewhat pure comic genius and is carried throughout the film.( If you have seen the film you will know what i mean. ;p)The CGI effects of this film were fantastic and as is mentioned often; the lantern scene had us a bit misty eyed. There was a closeness we obviously felt to the characters that is also aided by our love of Disney classics.All in all if you haven't seen this film yet i demand you do because it is worth every penny and is simply a most beautiful film with a beautiful story and characters. Don't be afraid to laugh and cry it shows enjoyment! I could praise it for ages but i fear my word limit would be breached. Disney is back and i am glad, hope it carries on. Tangled is a favourite forever now.","

"TANGLED","kikigalbreath","13 April 2014","I first saw Tangled in theaters when it came out, and I absolutely loved it! I especially loved the cleverness of Flynn, and the comical jokes he brought to the film. The animation is wonderful too, and it was unlike anything I'd ever seen. One of the high points of the movie for me, though, was the songs. I truly loved all of them, especially ""I See the Light."" In my opinion, it is underrated though, and I personally think it's better than ""Let it Go."" Unfortunately, I feel like Tangled is underrated. I've seen Frozen, which is all everyone ever talks about, and I thought it was good. But now that I've put more thought into it, I feel that Tangled is much better. There are some plot holes in Frozen, with unexplained parts, but Tangled really covers everything, and I laugh at all the jokes every time! All in all, there is some breath-taking animation on display, and the actors brought the characters to life. I enjoy watching this movie every once in a while, as it brings smiles and tears to me!","

"TANGLED","OneRingToRuleThemAll13","23 March 2012","First I would like to note that when I saw the previews for this film I was as non-interested as you could get (as other people here have pointed out)! I mean, GET A MARKETING CREW!! Ughhh!! The first trailer/teaser was horrible, and like 50% of the footage shown in the teaser wasn't even included in the final movie. The second trailer was a bit better though.2 weeks ago I finally gave up (after about 5 times of hearing from my soon-to-be sister-in-law that it was awesome and beautiful), and while I was in the hospital I asked my aunt to rent it for me so we could watch it on my sister's laptop. The first thing that went through my mind when the movie started was ''Huh... I guess this movie is just another attempt at Disney wanting to be cool and romantic while TRYING TO BE FUNNY!! :@@@''. Boy, was I wrong...This movie is everything you could possibly want from a modern Disney movie (which is saying a LOT since Disney isn't the same as it was in the days of yore). It has lots of action, beautiful CGI animation, great humor, awesome and deeply developed characters (which were voiced really well), and of course what would a traditional Disney movie be without awesome songs (more on that later)???!The story is (as you most probably know already) centered on a girl named Rapunzel, who after her mother (while still pregnant with Rapunzel) falls gravely ill and is cured by a magical, golden flower, gains beautiful, golden hair which can be used to heal people and give people eternal youth while singing it a special song (yes, it sounds kind of girly, but hey! I'm a 15-year-old boy and I ADORE THIS MOVIE!). A few days after her birth an old woman (referred to as Mother Gothel in the movie, and had been using the flower to stay young forever for centuries before the flower was used to heal Rapunzel's mother), visits Rapunzel's nursery and tries to cut a strand of Rapunzel's hair and starts singing the song, but is quickly stopped when she realizes that if you cut the hair, it turns brown and loses it's power. Faced with a difficult predicament, Gothel decides to steal the child and raise her as her own in order to stay young forever. I won't spoil anymore, so that you can enjoy the movie for it's amazing story. The voice-acting in this movie is spot-on (even though only 2 of the people involved in the cast are actually high-profile actors)! Mandy Moore as Rapunzel and Zachary Levi as Flynn Rider (the ''prince'' in the movie and Rapunzel's love interest), really give life to their characters, have great chemistry with each other, and they both sing beautifully. Donna Murphy is also excellent as Gothel, giving her character the necessary sarcasm and fake sweetness which surprisingly flawless skill, considering I'd never heard of her before.The songs are my favorite part of the movie. They make you feel full of joy in a world that is slowly turning into a world of violence and corruption, and that is something all of us need right now, and is usually not present in today's movies, which are usually full of over- the-top violence, sex and pervasive language. Don't worry, though, as you will not find ANY of those things here. There is one particular song in the movie that is easily one of the best Disney songs out there, and is so romantic and beautiful I just want to dance and smile whenever I hear it :')All in all, ''Tangled'' is an excellent family movie, and has something in it for everyone (even boys and adults, which at first glance doesn't seem to be the target demographic in these type of film). Keep it up, Disney!!!","

"TANGLED","anaconda-40658","5 February 2016","Tangled (2010): Dirt: Nathan Greno, Byron Howard / Voices: Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi, Donna Murphy, Ron Perlman, Brad Garrett: In the tradition of Hoodwinked here is another animated twisted take on a fairy tale. The theme is authority as Rapunzel is born with hair of healing power due to a rare flower used to heal her mother before her birth. She is kidnapped and raised in isolation within a tower by a woman who uses Rapunzel's singing power to render her youth. Animation is colorful and dazzling and directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard have a field day with tampering with the original concept. Mandy Moore voices Rapunzel, sheltered from the outside world by an evil hag. Now eighteen she desires to see the lights that only appear on her birthday. These lights are actually lanterns issued by the King and Queen in hopes that their daughter will one day return. Zachary Levi voices a thief named Eugene whose theft of a crown leads to shelter in the tower before being ambushed by Rapunzel. She makes a deal that will allow him to keep the crown if he will take her to the strange lights. This leads to a tremendous twist ending that honors sacrifice and surprise. Donna Murphy voices the hag whose loss of the age flower led to her kidnapping Rapunzel and corrupting her mind, but her defeat works best due to its method. Ron Perlman is also on board as well as Brad Garrett but many of these roles are cardboard. While it satirizes the fairy tale effectively it also creates humour and adventure to the appeal to families whom will want to get tangled up in it. Score: 9 ½ / 10","

"TANGLED","ja_kitty_71","14 December 2010","It was about time that any animation studio would make a film based on one of my favorite fairy-tales, Rapunzel, and I was glad Disney was the studio to make it. I saw the film only last weekend, and I thought it was awesome.The film goes like this : A magical golden flower with the power to heal was born from one ray of sunshine. A nasty woman known as Gothel uses the flower's power to restore her youth and beauty. A few centuries later, a kingdom was built, and just as the king and queen were going to have a baby, the pregnant queen became very ill. The people searched the land for the golden flower. Until the royal army spotted the flower and bought it back to the queen. Then a baby girl (Rapunzel) was born to the royal couple, and everyone in the land was happy. All except jealous, spiteful Gothel, who has learned that Rapunzel's golden hair retains the flower's healing abilities as long as it isn't cut, so she kidnaps the child and isolates her in a tower, raising the girl as her own daughter. However, every year on Rapunzel's birthday, the kingdom sends thousands of floating lanterns into the sky, longing for their lost princess to return.Eighteen years later, a thief known as Flynn Rider steals the lost princess' tiara and escapes the guards. Then he came upon Rapunzel's tower as a hiding place. Once he had scaled the tower, Flynn was held by the girl with the long hair. Rapunzel then strikes a deal with the charming thief to act as her guide to travel to the place where the floating lights come from that she has seen every year on her birthday. That's all I have to say; you'll have to see the film for yourself to find out how it ends, and, I know I say it all the time, but I don't have a favorite scene because I love the entire film.","

"TANGLED","lisafordeay","5 February 2011","As a lover for fairy tales like The Little Mermaid ,Beauty & the Beast and Aladdin,Disney went downhill with their last movie The Princess & the Frog and since then there wasn't a decent flick since 2007's Enchanted which was my all time favorite animated/live action movie.Yesterday I went to the cinemas by myself and I saw Tangled. Tangled is an up to date version of the classic Brother Grimns story Rapunzel. The story opens with a male voice telling the tale about a princess who was abducted by an evil woman named Mother Gothel who stoled the baby from her parents as she has healing magic powers that can heal and turn an old person back into their youthful form. Apparently the princesses's mother was sick and the guards from the palace found a healing flower and that is why Gothel stole the child. Fast forward a few years later and Rapunzel(voiced by MANDY MOORE)wishes to see the lantern lights as they appear every year for her birthday and she was celebrating her 18th birthday but Mother Gothel(voiced by DONNA MURPHY)doesn't want Rapunzel to leave the tower ever. Meanwhile a dashing rogue thief named Flynn Rider(who's real name is Eugene Fitzherbert)(voiced by Zac Levi)steals a crown from the palace and as he tries to find the perfect hideout for the stolen crown he spots a isolated tower and climbs up to the top,little does he realize he gets hit by a frying pan(yeah a frying pan )from Rapunzel who thinks Flynn is interested in her long 70ft blonde hair which glows when she sings that HEALING INCANTATION song. She hides the satchel where Flynn can't find it and she makes a deal with him that she will give it back to him if he takes her to see the lanterns for her 18th birthday and as she leaves her tower for the first time in 18 years she is about to go on a hair-raising hilarious adventure where she falls in love,and sees the outside world for the first time.The animation in this film is so exquisite part of you would think its a live action movie and not CGI. The music(done by the brilliant composer of our generation ALAN MENKEN)was brilliant and memorable especially the songs I SEE THE LIGHT(both sung by LEVI & MOORE),WHEN WILL MY LIF E BEGIN,and the villain song MOTHER KNOWS BEST. The story was brilliant yet kind slow enough to follow but as the film progressed I fell head over heels in love with the charcthers and the story I never blinked not once and I never looked at my watch throughout the 1hr and 36 mins. Mandy Moore was perfect for the voice role of Rapunzel I loved how her charcther progresses throughout the film and I love how she and Flynn(aka Eugene Fitzherbert I think this name is nice btw very Irish indeed)don't see eye to eye but they soon fall for one another when they see the lanterns (which was brilliant I must say I loved that part)and sing the song I SEE THE LIGHT(brilliant love song I can't get the song out of my head).ZAC LEVI was so hilarious in this film ('Her hair glows why does her hair glow' or 'Oh no no no this is not good they just can't get my nose right) I think Eugene Fitzherbert is the hottest Disney charcther alive. One scene that had me in tears(well almost)was the part where he apparently dies and before that he chops off Rapunzel's 70 ft hair that turns back into brown and he dies. She sings that healing song and her tears brought him back to life. The finale was so cute and heartwarming. TANGLED is without a doubt one of the best Disney animated films I have ever seen in my entire life since Beauty & the Beast(yes people it was THAT GOOD). Its got romance,memorable music,lovable charcthers,heartwarming ending,hilarious moments from the horse Maximus who had me in tears of laughter and the cute chameleon Pascal who uses his tongue to wake up Eugene when he gets knocked out from the frying pan incident and exquisite animation. I may be 19 going on 20 but this was the best 1 hr and 36 Min's of my life. Simply enchanting.BEST QUOTE:Eugene Fitzhebert: ""You were my new dream""Rapunzel:(cries)""And you were mine""BEST SCENE: The lantern scene was amazing I simply loved it so much.orThe part where Flynn almost dies and he sacrifice's Rapunzel's hair by chopping it all off. If you liked Stardust(evil woman wants girl for youth),Anastasia(lost princess falls for a bad boy),Shrek(hilarious adult humor), and The Little mermaid(boat scene)you will love this.FINAL VERDICT: Tangled is an instant classic that should be treasured for the rest of your life.10/10 Brilliant simply amazing I am in love with this film. Move over Princess & the frog this film is here to stay. But I hope they won't decide to do a sequel as it will ruin the magic in this film.","

"TANGLED","ElMaruecan82","13 April 2016","When it comes to setting up the story, ""Tangled"" doesn't take chances, it goes straightforwardly to the point like most Disney movies do, and that's the privilege movies based on fairy tales can afford, we expect them to begin by ""Once Upon a Time "".So, once upon a time  Gothel, a vain woman who found the power of eternal youth in a flower that magically grew out of a sunshine drop. Unfortunately for her, the flower is taken by the Royal guards and is used to cure the Queen right before she gives birth to Rapunzel, a beautiful girl with long glowing hair. Gothel understands the hair have inherited a part of the flower's powers, but when she cuts them, it turns to a plain (and powerless) brown. She then kidnaps Rapunzel and traps her in a tower where she treats her like a mother.18 years later, Rapunzel grew with such a long and thick head of hair, she can actually hang on them, dangled from them and seize things like a chameleon's tongue, which is a funny coincidence since her pet friend is a charming chameleon named Pascal. Rapunzel is also a beautiful creature (who strangely reminded me of Amanda Seyfried) confident about her hair's healing power but like any girl of her age, she's got fears and issues. For one thing, she never discovered the world, and can only watch the stars that illuminate the sky, ignoring that those that appear every year during her birthday, are sky lanterns launched by the king and the townspeople as a desperate attempt to reach her. There is a lot of glowing in the film, but there's more than yellow brightness to that.""Tangled"" is the 50th animated Disney film, it is a long way back to ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" but there are similarities despite the seven-decade gap. Like ""Snow White"", it's a story of a fallen princess held prisoner by an abusive 'mother-figure'. And if Snow White found escapism while looking for a Prince, Rapunzel found a prince while looking for escapism. Like ""Snow White"", ""Tangled"" was the most expensive animated movie of its time and the product of a great combination of talent and perfectionism, like ""Snow White"", it's based on a Grimm brothers story, and provides everything children and grown-ups except from fairy tale while translating to the big screen: action, fun, visuals, romance, fantasy, magic, emotions and a memorable villain.To a certain extent, ""Tangled"" is Disney coming full circle with the very magic that enchanted many generations from all over the word, with a creation made for the 2010's but not so far in spirit, from the enchantment of the old classics. It's a delight to the eyes and it features two irresistible leading protagonists, in charm and personality, a not-so rebellious girl and a not-so unredeemable criminal, named Flynn Rider, a guy actually sensitive about his nose and wrapped up in the conviction that he's the most charming person on Earth. And for a change, the two characters don't really start their relationship through mutual dislike, their encounter is rather funny and uses some slapstick rarely exploited in legitimate Disney features.It needs to be pointed out that ""Tangled"" belongs to one of the most refreshingly funny Disney movies. Seriously, how many of them feature a horse that is more efficient than his rider and is obsessed to the point you might discuss his psychological sanity or wish he was in the good guys' side? How many feature a frying pan as a deadly weapon and running gag? How many Disney movies feature frightening pub regulars who dream to be pianists or pantomimes', or a giant thug whose secret passion is to collect miniature unicorns? Describing these gags doesn't do them even justice because they work so well on a visual level. But I mention them because they highlight the best thing about ""Tangled"" humor : it's unpredictable even when relying on predictable situations.Another example is that ""Tangled"" follows a simple and conventional plot-line through the heroin's journey, basically, her discovery of the real world leading to her self-discovery until the final confrontation with the mother (with a few Oedipal undertones). But the plot matters less than the rich gallery of colorful characters it invites us to discover and personality traits of the two heroes that manages to transcend the usual requirements. The 'hero' is handsome but takes himself so seriously that he becomes pathetic, she's a free-spirited, idealistic and barefoot-walking teen who enjoys discovering the real world, but she's also reluctant to disappoint the woman she still believes is her mother. These traits are first mocked until they're exploited for more dramatic effects.Overall, the dosage is well done and makes the romance between the two outcasts believable. Naturally, some parts get predictable, when Gothel warns Rapunzel about Flynn looking only for the crown he stole, we know there'll be a quid pro quo, where she'd believe Mommy was right, but the conventional stuff is handled pretty quickly and the final third act is surprisingly efficient in its minimalism: no fight scene, no overdose of action and kinetic special effects, a simple display of love gestures and the perfect spectacular ending and feel-good twist. Rapunzel, in the tradition of coming-of-age stories, which are why fairy-tales were made for, was ready to trade her freedom for Flynn's life while Flynn decided his death was worth Rapunzel's freedom.This is the stuff great romances and fairy tales are made on. There are a few little things to criticize, some songs are less inspired and more forgettable than Menken's usual work, and the title could've been better chosen, ""Rapunzel"" would've done fine actually. Still, I believe ""Tangled"" is one of the best Disney films, one that magnificently reconciles between the old and the new.","

"TANGLED","aquariusgirl279","8 December 2010","I've wanted to see Tangled since I heard about it. I must have heard about it back in July. Maybe earlier. I remember seeing the teaser trailer where it just had the voices and the tower. Rapunzel was always my favorite of the Grimm Fairy Tales. I must be the only person in the world, but back when Less Than Perfect was on, I used to watch it. That's when my love for Zachary Levi began. I always liked him. I thought he was hilarious and Kipp was easily my favorite character. So when he was cast on Chuck, I started watching that show and I'm so glad I did. It's easily one of my favorite shows and it has only made my love for Zachary Levi grow exponentially. So when I heard he was cast as the ""prince"" I was so thrilled beyond belief. I couldn't wait. I remember thinking, ""I have to wait until Thanksgiving?!"" When I saw the first trailer, I legitimately squealed with excitement. Especially because Zachary Levi's character Flynn wasn't a prince, but a handsome and arrogant thief. My favorite kind of guy! Now I've finally seen Tangled and it surpassed my already extremely high expectations. I can't believe I didn't realize it was going to have music (why else would Mandy Moore be cast?) I felt extremely silly and thought, ""Of course. This is a Disney Princess movie."" I thought the movie was phenomenal. I already had incredibly high expectations and the movie was everything I expected and more. I thought it was a very interesting and creative take on Rapunzel. I've read the actual Grimm Fairy Tale, and it's true that it barely follows it. It just basically used the idea. From the first song to the last song, I loved every minute of this highly entertaining tale. Of course Mandy Moore did her own singing and then the first song came and Zachary Levi did his own too. And you know what? He wasn't even half bad. (Just another thing that makes me love him). I wasn't extremely stunned by how amazing he was and I don't really have an ear for music or technology, but it didn't sound like his voice was edited all that much (but that's just me). You know how you hear those girls singing on Disney and it kind of sounds like a robot/computer is singing? Well, it didn't sound like that. And I know Zachary Levi's speaking voice very well (I've been watching him on TV for years) and it sure sounded like him. I was pleasantly surprised. And of course, I'm a sucker for a Disney Princess movie. Rapunzel was very tough, which I liked, kind of like Tiana from Princess and the Frog. And I liked how the romance definitely developed through their adventures. Having read the actual Grimm Fairy Tale in which the prince falls out the window after being tricked by Mother Gothel into coming in and goes blind, I had a guess as to what was going to happen to Flynn after he cut Rapunzels hair. In the original tale, Rapunzel cried on him and his eye sight was restored, leading me to believe that her tears would bring him back to life. I have to admit though, I was a bit nervous as was my friend who didn't know as much about the original tale. Anyway, I should wrap this up. The movie looked gorgeous (wouldn't expect less from Disney), the music was great, I loved the voice acting (anyone else notice Brad Garrett as the guy with the hook hand?!), I loved the storyline, I loved the new princess, I loved the new prince. I loved the new, creative look at a classic fairy (especially turning the prince into a thief; I thought that was brilliant). So if you couldn't tell, I enjoyed the movie. Quite a bit. I would recommend it to anyone. I don't have anything to say about the 3D as I saw it in 2D (3D makes me physically nauseous). But I enjoyed it so much, I've seen in twice and I might go again next week.","

"TANGLED","kimme-kimono","27 November 2010","I have not been a fan of many Disney movies since the ""Lion King,"" and the few I have liked have been done with Pixar (WallE, TS3, Nemo). I grew up in the Disney Renaissance of the late 80s and early 90s and this is the first movie if have seen since the Fabulous Four that makes me believe Disney still has a place in the film business. The only down side is the soundtrack. I love Alan Menken-the first play I ever saw as 6 year old was ""Little Shop of Horror"" and the first movie I saw in theaters as two year old was ""The Little Mermaid."" I had high hopes for the soundtrack but there was not another ""Under the Sea"" in the score. Disney fans and connoisseurs will tell you before a robot brought humans back to earth, before some toys came to life, before a lion became a king, before Aladin unleashed the Genie and before Beauty tamed the Beast there was a Little Mermaid who single-handedly saved the Disney animation studio. I hope in the future we will be saying the same thing about a blonde-haired girl who spent most of her life locked in a tower!I know this is not really a good review, but for all you Disney skeptics that feel let down from the Princess and the Frog and Meet the Robinsons-this is worth your time!","

"TANGLED","CinemaClown","10 April 2016","Walt Disney Animation Studios' 50th animated feature still carries the label of the most expensive animated film ever made but it is also noteworthy for reversing the odds in the legendary studio's favour for Tangled marks the commencement of Disney's Revival Era and begins the studio's long- awaited resurgence towards its lost glory.Tangled tells the story of Rapunzel, a young princess whose magical hair have healing properties, for which she was kidnapped by an old witch who then raises her as her own child. Having spent her entire life in an isolated tower, Rapunzel is curious to explore the world outside, and ultimately leaves her home to embark on a magnificent journey of self-discovery.Co-directed by Nathan Greno & Byron Howard, Tangled features all the hallmarks of a Disney fairy tale yet what eventually separates it from other similar examples is its clever combination of old & new. Despite having a simple structure & treading on familiar routes, there's ample freshness in its story, the characters are beautifully carved and the animation evokes a deep sense of warmth too.Blending the best of both traditional & computer animation, the 3D images retain the painting-like quality of hand-drawn style with pixel-perfect depth & sharpness of CGI and it is absolutely drop- dead gorgeous to look at, especially that lantern sequence which can easily rival anything that the studio has put up before or since, and its old-fashioned vibe only adds more richness to the story.Also returning to the fold is Alan Menken who contributes with a mesmerising score & fitting songs and even though they aren't very catchy, they work in the film's favour. Further benefiting the story is its fluid camera-work, tight editing & brisk pace plus the voice cast does a splendid job with their respective characters, the relation dynamics are sensibly explored, and the palace horse Maximus easily stands out.On an overall scale, Tangled is a fresh breath of life from the studio that had been sitting dormant for years and the way Disney manages to turn things around is by going back to its fairy tale roots, albeit with a reinvigorated passion, creative energy & upgraded visual flair. Delightfully refreshing, surprisingly heartfelt & scoring big on quality entertainment, Tangled is one of the finest entries in Disney's repertoire. Definitely recommended.","

"TANGLED","blackwidowis7cool","12 August 2019","I must confess that I was a bit unsure about watching Disney's version of the tale of Rapunzel - partially because I secretly enjoyed the original tale and was worried about what they would do with it and also partially due to the fact that I didn't think it would make that great a film. But, I decided to sit down and watch it, anyway.
I had grown used to Disney's new style of story telling - in movies such as Zootopia, Frozen, Wreck-It Ralph, and Big Hero 6, and Brave. I quite love this new style, which felt more...I don't know, real. So, when the movie started, I was quite surprised to find that Tangled wasn't like any of these movies, and was done in old Disney style with narrations, and immediately revealing who the villain is, and several other big reveals right at the start instead of being revealed later in the movie like they do now. It was like a mixture of old Disney classic story telling with a bit of Looney Tunes thrown in.
At first I was unsure how this would play out, but I actually quite enjoy how they told in the old Disney classic way. In fact, without the narration at the start, I don't think some parts of the film (particularly with Mother Gothel and Rapunzel at the start) would have made much sense.
The animation and attention to detail was quite good and very enjoyable. I rather like and appreciate some of the changes made to the story - such as instead of a prince, the movie makers make it a thief called Flynn Rider, a thief that you just can't help but love. Flynn is full of himself, witty, great at thieving, sly, and just a really likeable guy - oh, and Rapunzel's love interest. Zachary Levi does an excellent job with Flynn - made him quite funny. Mandy Moore does a great job as the main character Rapunzel. She is the perfect voice for the naive, outgoing, bubbly, fish-out-of-water character that Rapunzel is. But Rapunzel can also handle herself and her natural charm helps them out of bad situations in hilarious ways.
The songs were quite good and catchy - my personal favourite is I've got a dream. Very hilarious and old-fashioned Disney song. I also loved how Disney made a crack or two at themselves in the movie.
And because it's Disney, we can excuse the implausibility of some of the scenes and some of the all-around cheesy and silly parts - though there was one scene which I thought was a bit overdone and quite stupid. At first it was funny, but as it continued it began to feel stupid and pushed.
The climax was excellent and very tense and emotional. I couldn't help but notice similarities between Tangled and Frozen - such as with Rapunzel and Anna both being outgoing females who are isolated from the world and both going on an adventure and teaming up with rough diamonds like Flynn and Kristoff. Then there's the climax. I noticed quite a few similarities there. I thought it was interesting, considering the fan theory of Tangled and Frozen taking place in the same universe and Elsa, Anna, and Rapunzel being cousins.
Donna Murphy was very, very good as Mother Gothel - Disney's last classic villain. Very evil, conniving, dark villain. Overall it is a great movie - particularly due to the old-fashioned classic storytelling style it was told in. There was a very minor hiccup, but otherwise quite good and I love it. If you like classic Disney movies, then this movie is for you.","

"TANGLED","r96sk","20 August 2020","An enjoyable tale about Rapunzel.'Tangled' kicks off Disney's animated releases for the 2010s in very strong fashion. It's nicely created, with fun characters and a hearty storyline. It actually sets a lot of the foundations that 2013's 'Frozen' uses, there's a fair amount of similarities between the two.Mandy Moore does a terrific job in the lead role, she's brings an energetic edge to the character alongside good humour. Zachary Levi (Flynn) and Donna Murphy (Mother Gothel) are more than decent in their respective parts. You also have the amusing (non-speaking) Maximus.It's still very much the usual fairytale/princess thing, but it manages to add a lively turn to proceedings which keeps it entertaining.","

"TANGLED","Vartiainen","28 June 2016","Disney's 50th animated canon feature film - though they cheated by retroactively adding Dinosaur into the list - and in many ways a brilliant comeback for the studio.Tangled, based on the story Rapunzel by Brothers Grimm, feels very familiar if you grew up with the Disney Renaissance films. It's a princess movie, with lots of action, brilliant animation and lots of song numbers. Yet you can definitely see the decade or two that separates it from the Renaissance. Rapunzel is a very different kind of heroine. You can see a lot of Belle and Ariel in her, perhaps even a bit of Mulan, but she is very much a princess for the new century. Very dynamic, very ready with words, very quirky even. The same with our ""prince"", Flynn Rider, who is to Aladdin what Aladdin was to the princes of the 40s and 50s, while still being very kid friendly and accessible. They both have this attitude to them. And while at times it can be a bit heavy-handed, I do admit liking the update. For the most part.I also really like the villain, Mother Gothel. She's what you would get if you took Lady Tremaine from Cinderella, but made her more subtle. She's very clearly an abusive parent, but you're not quite certain if the abuse is intentional or whether she just doesn't know any other way. Her relationship with Rapunzel is one of the more fascinating parent-child dynamics I've yet seen from Disney.And overall it's just a fun film, exactly what you should expect from Disney. It can seem a bit calculated from time to time, especially when it comes to the Dreamworks-esque hipness of the main characters, but it's still a good adventure and solid entertainment all around. Recommended for all fans of Disney and good, solid animation.Though the name of the film should have been Rapunzel! Curse you, overly cautious marketing.","

"TANGLED","FilmFreak94","30 April 2011","My history with Tangled is a rocky one. Like many people I was disappointed with the trailer and thought that Disney was trying to copy off the formula that made Shrek famous. The tile change from Rapunzel to Tangled didn't sit well for me at the time either. Before I even saw the film I thought that it would be a huge disaster.Thankfully, Disney proved me wrong. Tangled is one of the best Disney films I've seen in a very long time. The story is well written and the characters are all very enjoyable(the horse and the chameleon steal the show). The animation for Tangled can only be described in one word... 'beautiful.' Every little detail in this movie, from the backgrounds to the crowds of people, are perfectly animated. The two things that stand out are the floating lanterns scene and Rapunzel's hair. Admitadely, the songs took awhile for me to get used to. It felt as though Alan Menken wasn't really on his A-game when he did Tangled, but that doesn't necessarily mean the songs are awful, you'll just need to listen to them a few times before they really grow on you. Overall Tangled is by far one of the best films to come out of Disney in a long time. If you have kids or if you're just a fan of animation then you should definitely give Tangled a look.","

As an adult, I too enjoyed the film, though, not totally.After watching masterstrokes like 'Up' and 'Toy Story 3' recently, I've raised my expectations way too much from an animation flick. As I had heard the legend of Rapunzel as a kid, 'Tangled' didn't offer much novelty to me. But despite the popular story it adapts, the film holds you, especially in the first hour, which is superb. The only shortcoming in this love-story, is the overdose of Songs. They keep popping up, and one truly wishes if they weren't hammered so many times.Looking from the point of view kids mainly, I suggest you do make your kids watch 'Tangled', as it will be a dazzling & memorable experience for them. And I'd say for those, who still are a kid at heart, do watch it... the spell-binding animation & 3D effects are sure to keep you energized.","

It's be interpreted in so many different ways over the years, that it was about time that Disney had a go! As usual, they didn't disappoint. With its stunning animation, heartwarming story line and lovable characters, Tangled is in many ways, a perfect movie. As a Disney kid, my opinion on most Disney movies is extremely biased, but I can promise you, hand on heart, that Tangled is worth watching. It keeps you entertained from start to finish, and tops it off with a sickly sweet ending, classic Disney style! Take it from someone who has watched this movie more times than most, has read the ""Art Of"" book from cover to cover and has an unhealthy obsession with it. Ignore the hate, and just give it a go, because you won't be left unsatisfied...","

After a great decade of films in the 1990's, Disney Animations begun to release lesser quality films....until this film, which is leading the surge of what's to come. This film recaptures the magic of early Disney films and it shows I can renew my faith in Disney. This film is beautifully-animated and has such wonderful songs one can sit back and sing along with.Bryon Howard's film is about a princess named Rapunzel who has special anti-aging powers because of her hair and is kidnapped by an old witch for her powers and is not allowed to leave her tower. But one day, she comes across a thief named Flynn Rider whose paths were destined to cross.The voice-cast is not too bad. Hardly anybody too famous here, but they all do their job quite well. Mandy Moore is the biggest name here and she does a great job as Rapunzel. Zachary Levi brings some wit and charm as Flynn Rider.Overall, Tangled is a great Disney film because it clearly has magic running through its veins. It's beautifully-animated, tells a great story, and it just has you wanting more. It's not the best Disney film, but looking at the films that came a decade before this film, it's a big improvement over those films. I rate this film 9/10.","

And it was genuinely funny!! Also, the songs were actually good! I usually hate singing in animated films, and sometimes Disney films can have the sappiest, schlockiest songs. But these were wonderful. The song ""Mother Knows Best"" is a combination of great lyrics, great singing, and great emoting on the part of the actress/vocalist who performed it.

"TANGLED","freemantle_uk","17 May 2014","Disney has one of the greatest animation studios around and has fans all around the world. After a long hiatus the studio returned to fairy adaptations. With Tangled they retold the story of Rapunzel and Disney delivered a delightful family film, filled with humour and comedy, brilliant and colourful animation (which is terrific on Blu-ray), action and drama. They is plenty of slapstick reminiscence to the Looney Toons, particularly been the leading male character and the a very determined horse. They are verbal jokes and gags through character interactions. Donna Murphy gave us an interesting villain, someone who is a more subtle and manipulative character on Rapunzel and adds a mother-daughter dynamic. The songs are sadly a little more pop princess and not particularly memorial. The stand out song is 'Mother Knows Best', sounding similar to 'Master of the House' from Les Mis and the visuals match the song well. Good viewing if you want something light-hearted.On minor nitpick I have is that I thought Rapunzel's mouth was too big.","

"TANGLED","kosmasp","20 January 2011","Since Pixar has taken over creative control over Disney projects, they have gone up. Not only financially but also creatively. And it shows in the outcome of this movie too. While there might be a musical number or two too many in this one, they are still pretty rare. And if you can endure them, you will be treated to a very funny movie. With animals that might not sing (or talk for that matter), but do have a mind of their own nonetheless.And it's the animals that almost outshine the human (drawn) cast. But while the story is predictable, you will find yourself cheering for the all the right reasons (if you are not too pessimistic that is, of course). Or too cynical. It was the last movie I watched in 2010 in cinemas and I was not disappointed!","

"TANGLED","j-hunt01","1 February 2011","'I don't do back story' claims an arrogant Flynn Rider - the outlawed central male character of Disney's 'Tangled' - when his history is probed by Rapunzel, his equally headstrong female counterpart. Incidentally, 'Tangled' doesn't do back story either, or even side plots for that matter; viewers are brought up to speed in a narrated introduction that gives us the who, what, why, where and when in an account given by the aforementioned criminal, revealing information in a biased light and missing an opportunity to explore the motivations of characters seen in the opening scene. This would be a detriment to many a film in which the tactic would be seen as lazy, however, 'Tangled' is solely focused on the growth of its dynamic duo and every other plot device and supporting character serves only as a catalyst for Flynn and Rapunzel's development. Interaction between other characters, such as the King and Queen who lost their daughter, is limited, but these omissions aren't vital as the emotional investment of the film is purely concentrated on its main characters. In a film about a girl who hasn't set foot outside for eighteen years, Disney appropriately isolate Rapunzel even more in her own story as she ventures beyond her tower for the first time.Immediately noteworthy is the overall style of the screenplay, which resembles the witty tone and slapstick of a Dreamworks Animation product, particularly that of Shrek. It's refreshing to see Disney dabble in humour like this as Pixar and Dreamworks are both so black and white in their methods that I have never before witnessed a blend of their approaches as I have in 'Tangled', where heavy character work and physical sidekick antics compliment each other consistently, giving the film a real family-friendly consistency. While Disney may have come under fire for marketing the film towards both male and female demographics, dismissing a focus on the princess, the studio proves an unevenly skewed fairy tale can resonate with all audiences. Kidnapped from the palace as a child by an ageing hag, Rapunzel is hidden away so her captor can utilise the magic in the princess' golden locks to restore her youthful beauty whenever need be. As her prisoner grows older and more inquisitive, it becomes increasingly more difficult to suppress her thoughts of leaving; until the day that Flynn Rider, looking for a place to hide from the law, stumbles upon the tower. Joining Flynn on the run from the respective forces of authority ruling over them, Rapunzel is faced with realising her past and understanding the true nature of the world beyond her window. Aided by her pet chameleon, the hilariously silent Pascal, and a grumpy, defected police horse named Maximus, the pair become intertwined in the complexity of each other's situations. Twisting the archetype of the evil stepmother, Disney have shaped an unforgettably manipulative enemy in Rapunzel's keeper, and viewers will hang on every cunning, contradicting word she speaks throughout; the land equivalent of Ursula ('The Little Mermaid'), Disney merchandise in her image won't exactly be flying off the shelves in a hurry.Five years in development and amassing what is currently believed to be the second highest budget for a feature film ever, the tech of 'Tangled' is justifiably breathtaking. Animating human forms is no longer the issue it once was, with close-ups of Rapunzel and Flynn proudly included now that their faces can express emotions so clearly (fifteen years ago 'Toy Story' routinely depicted characters from the waist down). Their world is picturesque, where each blade of glass falls with weight and water flows according to the laws of physics. Arguably a character in its own right, Rapunzel's hair is lush and textured, and its length is managed in genius and humorous manners. These visuals strengthen many sequences which will no doubt become iconic, particularly a scene set at night where hundreds of glowing fire lanterns illuminate the sky and water. Scored by Alan Menken, who follows a genre-specific approach like the jazz and gospel laden 'The Princess and the Frog', the soundtrack is typically touching, though time will tell if the musical numbers of 'Tangled' will be memorable in years to come; they don't convey the great sense of scale the characters are facing so well as, for example, 'Part of That World' (The Little Mermaid') or 'A Whole New World' ('Aladdin'), where the lyrics encapsulate the concept of the entire movie in a more grandiose way. Described as a combination of medieval music and folk rock, the music is suitably theatrical and at times pantomime, striking a chord with the persevering lightheartedness of the film, while Menken's scoring is rousing and accentuates each character well.Introducing a lovable family of characters and maintaining a return to form that began with 'The Princess and the Frog' , 'Tangled' is a successful fairy tale adaptation that lets its hair down for the sake of having a good time, proving that the tradition of the classic fairy tale is one that should be fiddled with, rather than forgotten.9/10","

"TANGLED","Smells_Like_Cheese","6 December 2010","Can you believe it? Disney has reached it's 50th animated film and what way to celebrate a wonderful magical company but with another princess story. We've had the pleasure of adding Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast to the magnificent list of best animated movies of all time despite all virtually having the same story. The reason being is because even though they were all the same story, they all had something different to offer with animation, songs, characters and along with other Disney classics like The Lion King, Aladdin or The Jungle Book(you know there's more titles of course) we've always opened our hearts to these classic stories. Disney takes on an old fairytale of Rapunzel and what way to celebrate but with CGI animation, again. Tangled is a very good film but it's not the instant classic that Disney needed. Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie, it's got great animation, lots of humor and very lovable characters.One night, Gothel, an evil selfish old lady kidnaps Princess Rapunzel who has magic gold hair that can keep Gothel looking young and living forever; she isolates the princess in a tower as her own daughter. Eighteen years later, Rapunzel tells Gothel that she wishes to see the floating lights that appear on her birthday every year, but Gothel rejects her by telling Rapunzel that the world is a dangerous place. Meanwhile, the thief Flynn Rider and his twin thugs heist the tiara of the missing princess from the castle. As they flee, Flynn abandons the twins, allowing the pursuing castle guards to capture them. Flynn happens upon Rapunzel's tower to hide in, only to be held captive by Rapunzel and her pet chameleon, Pascal. Rapunzel bargains with Flynn that if he escorts her to the lights and back, she will return the tiara; Flynn agrees. But as they go into the city, Rapunzel starts to feel something familiar as everyone talks about the lost princess that was stolen years ago.I guess for Disney's 50th animated picture I wanted a little more, look at me, I'm talking like the Disney princess almost singing how I want more. The songs were not too catchy, except for the dream song at the bar, that was very humorous and a good time to watch. Another thing I liked about the film is that it seems like a lot of animated films are relying too much on pop culture for humor and can be too trendy at times, I like that we went back to the old fairy tale. However, couldn't we have done hand drawn animation? I miss that a lot, it has this certain charm and felt like the animators took the time and effort, I know that CGI animation is cheaper and faster, so it can make an audience member feel a little cheated. I also know that 3D is big, but again why always go with trendy? This isn't what Walt Disney intended with his company I'm sure. But still would I recommend Tangled? Absolutely, and I can't wait for the DVD to add to my Disney collection, this was a terrific film for the whole family to enjoy. After all, it has a horse that makes Dirty Harry look like Barney and I feel bad for that chameleon who I guess should have stolen the show but lets face it, that horse deserves a spin off sequel now. Disney, let's get Max his own movie! Well, I hope that Disney takes my tip about the hand drawn animation, let's go back to the good old days.8/10","

They are usually very candy floss and the songs are mostly syrupy sweet. But Tangled is surprisingly fun as both the male and female leads are really well written and performed beautifully. Romance mostly takes the backseat & adventure becomes the focus. The songs are really well situated and lifts the story. One of the Better Princess Movies out there.","

I watched Frozen last week, and I was looking for something cute and inoffensive to watch, to help me soothe my anxiety. Tangled was not what I expected at all, in the best way possible!I very rarely laugh at comedies, even ones that are targeted at adults, let alone kids, but holy moly, this movie is actually hilarious! None of the clichéd, predictable jokes - these are all golden, and make a grown man laugh out loud!I also love how emotional this movie is, I was completely invested, not even looking at my phone even once (and that's saying something). I got very attached to the characters, they are extremely easy to love.As much as I enjoyed Frozen, Tangled simply blows it out of the water, it is funnier, has more loveable and developed characters and has a bigger emotional impact.This is truly a masterpiece.","

"TANGLED","TourettesPersonal","13 February 2011","My first glance of ""Tangled"" I thought it's gonna be an ordinary CGI Disney flick but it turns out to be a magical movie that brings back all the good memories of the old Disney movies. I honestly think ""Tangled"" is more magical than the recent Disney fairy tale movie ""Princess and the Frog"".The new story of Rapunzel is quite clever & the songs recaptures the magic of Disney. I also liked the character development. Rapunzel is curious and adorable while Flynn Rider is an adventurous and some narcissist like attitude. The voice acting was great but the best performance goes to Donna Murphy the voice of Mother Gothel.""Tangled"" is disappointing in the trailers but if you see the movie, you could feel the magic and it brings back the childhood days of Disney. My only problem of this movie the intro and the ending is too quick. But it's fun and entertaining for the whole family. ""Tangled"" will not disappoint you.","

"TANGLED","webmaster-736-444741","18 January 2014","I considered giving this movie a 9 so that anyone looking at the rating would be less inclined to see it as from just another person who is easily pleased. Quite the contrary actually. I am almost annoyingly picky about all manner of things, including entertainment. Yet Tangled is simply a perfect 10, no way around it. So ultimately I decided to risk looking easy and give the proper score.By the way, I can only take so many animated works and in fact rejected the offer of borrowing somebody else's Red Box rental about five days ago (Planes, I think). Correction: I actually watched perhaps five minutes then shut it off. Probably not terrible. But like I said, only so much willingness to view the typical animated story.Before today, Toy Story and Shrek were both excellent in my book, yet most Disney or similar titles get skipped by me. Not knowing that Tangled fell into that category, I started watching while messing with other matters, then nearly shut 'er off in the first minute upon realizing what was unfolding, a cartoon. A couple of snappy dialog moments led me to holding on for another minute. By that time, I was in for a pound.No ""review"" other that what is written above because I really dislike being given plot details before watching a movie. The actual previews are the worst, somehow amazingly revealing the entire show in 90 seconds. Written reviews tend to be spoilers for me also, even if technically devoid of officially termed spoiler descriptions. So what you get from me is that the movie includes snappy dialogue, oh, and a few unexpected turns, plus of course likable characters and a bad guy. Take the risk.","

It's a nice, interesting story about a lost princess who escapes the tower she's been locked in by an evil witch who she thinks is her mother and finds her way to her biological family, the King and Queen. Along the way, she falls in love and makes some new friends. I like that. The song ""Mother Knows Best,"" adds to Mother Gothel's , ruthless, devious personality, and so does the reprise. I highly recommend this masterpiece to everyone who's willing to give Tangled a try.","

I saw this on a decent-sized screen in 3D, and my was I blown away by the intricacies of each frame. The hair in itself would have killed the animators. There were some scenes that made me really emotional - just because of the shear beauty in the rendering. The horrible, unoriginal, mediocre and cliché-filled trailer really persuaded me to not see this, but I decided to give it ago. It's really much more complicated than the original storyline, and there are, of course, additional characters to increase the humor and drama of it all - and I didn't mind any of that. At first I thought there was too much singing - but the songs were so well constructed that I didn't mind them either. All of the characters are charming, and the antagonist was well solidified - she is really a great symbol for realistic evils in society.OST: 9/10 Animation fluidity: 10/10 Characters: 9/10 Humor: 9/10 Family appropriate: 10/10 - especially moms.

"TANGLED","lauraberrill","26 July 2012","Hi there, I haven't wrote a review in quite a long time now, I think almost a year actually, but never mind about that, I've now decided to return to write a review on Disney's remake of the classic fairy tale ""Rapunzel"", but instead of naming the movie ""Rapunzel"" Disney decided to get a bit more creative with the title, so instead they named it: ""Tangled"". Now to start off, let me just say that this fairy tale (or princess story) Disney movie is quite different than almost all the other ones they've done for three reasons. For a start, it's in CGI rather than being hand drawn, second, like I stated earlier, they decided to get more creative with the title, so instead named ""Tangled"" instead of just ""Rapunzel"", and third, the rating's PG instead of U/G.Now this isn't a bad thing, it can actually turn out as a good thing, since it makes this move more unique than most other fairy tales Disney has done. Now, I would explain the story, but trust me, it would be way too long for me to explain it, plus I would have enough room for the whole review.So, what do I think of this animated movie? Well, if it wasn't already obvious, I freaking' love this movie, just like a lot other people do, especially Disney fans, which I am. Seriously, this is way better than the Princess and the Frog last year (in my opinion). Now, I liked that movie too, but I just find this one way better. But now for the voice actors/actresses.The heroine, Rapunzel, is voiced by Mandy Moore, which is nice. The hero, a charming thief called Flynn Rider, is voiced by Zachary Levi, he also does a good job. And of course, the main villain, an old lady (or witch, if you will), is voiced by Donna Murphy. Coolness! Other voices include Ron Perlman, M.C. Gainey, Jeffrey Tambour and Brad Garret.And now, finally, time for my final thoughts on this movie.Tangled is an amazing movie! Hands down one of the best movies of the year. Would highly recommend getting this on DVD, especially if you have kids. I still have it on DVD and I still enjoy it the same. It has excellent animation, quite a few entertaining characters especially the ""animal companions"" (Pascal, Rapunzel's pet chameleon, and Maximus, a palace stallion), the songs are all great in my eyes, and not to mention its based on a classic fairy-tale. By far, one of my favorite Disney movies ever. Oh, and BTW, don't read this if you don't wanna be spoiled, Rapunzel and Flynn both start to fall in love as the movie goes on. Well it IS a Disney movie after all. But anyways, final thoughts, this is an outstanding animated movie. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.Rating: 9/10 - or - ****1/2 out of *****Hope you enjoyed this review, which is actually my first proper review. Be sure to check in on my next review, which hopefully should be soon. But until then, see y'all later.","

"TANGLED","kdross42","9 July 2011","I was extremely skeptical about seeing this movie for the first time. At 21, I grew up with some really great Disney movies (Pocahontas, Aladdin, Mulan, Hunchback etc.) so lately all of the new releases have been coming up short of my expectations. I was especially disappointed with the Princess and the Frog movie, so I had low hopes for this movie. However, I found myself at redbox renting it none the less. And surprisingly- I LOVED it. I thought it was the perfect blend of new technology and the classic Disney feel; for once 3D-ish animation did not bother me. The storyline was great and some of the songs were very fun (When Will My Life Begin has been playing on my iPod nonstop for a few days). The heroine was a believable character with self-doubt, and the rascal-turned-hero process didn't happen too quickly like there is a tendency to do now. Also, it was nice that Rapunzel didn't fall for the guy the moment she laid eyes on him. There was plenty of well placed comedy, some of which was cliché but not overdone. I would recommend this movie for anyone to see, no matter what their age. There were a lot of good messages in it that are applicable to everyone. Kudos Disney.","

"TANGLED","Sergeant_Tibbs","3 November 2013","Although Disney will forever be immortal for their varied peaks of films since 1937, they have been struggling to stand out lately. The word Disney has become synonymous with animation and its easy for Pixar, Fox and Dreamworks to all come under the same label for kids, rather than show themselves as competitors. They thrive on franchises whereas Disney tries to keep its sequels to its straight-to-bargain bin department. These franchise films become events and although I would call Wreck-It Ralph an event movie, the average joe has no idea who made it anyway. So in retrospect, I do feel bad for overlooking Tangled as it belongs in a difficult and murky time for unique animated films, especially as it's CGI as opposed to Disney's previous landmark The Princess and the Frog. But surprisingly, it's a super charming film and it has an broadness that truly does appeal to everyone. I think it's in the sense of humour, it's very quirky and dry, reminding me of the laid-back attitude The Emperor's New Groove and Shrek. There's brilliant running gags and details sprinkled around that land immediately and make it a more involving experience.The quality in the animation was definitely worth the ballooned budget and more as they can compete with Pixar at this point. However, the storytelling is typical and overfamiliar at this point. Sure, it's Disney's style, but it's nowhere near as refreshing as Wreck-It Ralph for instance. Its biggest mistake was the songs. It could've been okay if they were unique, but they seemed like they were tagged on out of necessity. Too often do they drag the film into melodrama when it actually hits some poignant notes from time to time, but its biggest sin is that they're too plain. I also found myself wanting to know a lot more about the antagonist. She was hundreds of years old and her motivation seemed to only strike in the last twenty. There's something Walt Disney used to say which I wish the makers of Tangled took on board which is a film is only as strong as its antagonist. Sometimes it seems like the good guys will never make it as she's hot on their tails, but then it never follows through until it's hit the point it wants to show. But it's fine, the enjoyable side characters more than make up for her and in the end, Tangled wins you over. Definitely a great attempt at Disney modernising without selling their spirit.7/10","

"TANGLED","fluturoj","13 August 2016","This was so adorable. Quite enjoyable to watch and leaves you in a very good mood. The real-life lessons: Don't be afraid to go after your dreams, you'll never know what happens. This sounds quite cliché but it is so true. If Rapunzel was scared to go after the dream, if she preferred to stay where was comfortable and she thought was safe, she would have never fallen in love, seen that the world is not scared and realise that she is the lost princess. Just proves that you never know for sure what is a the best for you, it may not be what you believe and as in this case what you believe is good is actually the only bad thing in your life (Rapunzel so called mother). So courage to go after your dreams. and also a very good representation that once you have accomplished a dream, you find a another one. Just wondering after Rapunzel and Flynn Rider got each other (they were each other dreams) what will their next dream be? Another lesson is that things are not always what they seem and so don't assume the worse (even when it really looks like that). Flynn Rider did not leave with the crown as they made Rapunzel believe since it looked quite so. But then again, if things are not what they seem, the person that is being bad represented will do anything to let you know its not what it seemed (Flynn coming back to Rapunzel) (if they can of course because if he was hanged and not saved he would never be able to let Rapunzel know he did not leave her and she would for always believe that). So go after your dreams and don't assumes the worse. Plausibility: this is a fairytale talking about plausibility is not plausible (see what I did there). Character analysis: just want to say that I never knew that a course could ever be my favourite character but I just fell in love with Maximus. He was so so so adorable. Mother Gothel was a smart weak woman. She used intrigue and lies to get her way. She made Rapunzel believe that she loved her and wanted her safe so that she would agree in starting in. She did not use evilness, she just manipulated a you woman. She was lets say a modern evil woman. The leads I will not discuss since they were the perfect character with all the right values (implausible but a necessity for movies like this that have a young audience). Storytelling: I liked that the movie was not evil, Rapunzel saw the lights, the mother only intervened after. It gives you a very warm feeling it does not fill you with anger (as it would for example if Rapunzel did see the lights because of her mother). So very warm and a good watch.","

"TANGLED","DICK STEEL","27 November 2010","There's some controversy over the name change from Rapunzel to Tangled, but in Singapore we probably got the best of both worlds with Rapunzel - A Tangled Tale, highlighting that this was still in essence, a Rapunzel-Rapunzel-Let-Down-Your-Hair tale. The latest offering to add to Disney's growing list of Princess films, and thought to be the last, this 50th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series sees the Brothers Grimm's tale being given the Disney update, and that means being more child friendly, thought slapped with a PG rating rather than the usual G.The formula that Disney uses on its chosen princesses from fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm or Hans Christian Anderson amongst others, seem to come with the requisite beautiful singing voice since breaking out into song about their plight and a duet is the norm, and have this aura that birds, butterflies and bees tend to flock to, possessing this power over animals and assisted by a sidekick from the insect or animal kingdom. There's also the Prince Charming equivalent who will gallop over hills and valleys to save his beloved, before living happily ever after expected ending.In all counts, Tangled satisfied the above, though there was a moment in the finale which I thought, since it's touted as the last Princess film (though never say never with box office success) that they would go for the jugular and put a new spin on things, but I guess what's formula shouldn't be tweaked unless it's broke. Mandy Moore the singer plays Rapunzel and so automatically gives the character her singing voice as well, being captured by the evil Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) and imprisoned in a tower (well, very nicely discouraged from getting out to the big bad world out there), though yearning very much to be part of the world seen through her window, much like The Little Mermaid's Ariel. Her chameleon sidekick and palace horse Maximus, though without a voice, are likely to be the more popular Disney animal sidekicks out there with their timely antics, and if there are soft toys of them, I'm quite sure they will do pretty brisk business.But what's slightly different here is that the male lead Flynn Rider (voiced by Zachary Levi) happens to be a rogue in all sense of the word, a thief who has double-crossed the Stabbington Brothers (Ron Perlman) during a joint heist. Not a prince and hardly the gentleman to begin with, his accidental chance upon Rapunzel doesn't result in an instant love connection, but one that developed over time in their journeys to bring her out of her tower, to somewhere close enough to observe a lantern festival that happens on her birthday, where the royalty of the land commemorates the disappearance of the kingdom's princess (no prizes here of course – most of the time one party amongst the lovebirds has got to be of royal blood). I suppose the character's tapered to be slightly more realistic than the swashbuckling hero according to plan.Villains wise, Tangled's Mother Gothel is probably more simple in her motivation to keep Rapunzel's magical hair powers all for herself, an elixir for immortality, though her schemes and execution to do so are more complex and cerebral, preferring mind games and manipulation instead to get her wants, rather than magical powers and potions, being the weak old lady she actually is who's cheapskate enough not to go for botox. With no real powers nor weapons to exercise her threat, she's actually quite weak if it boils down to fisticuffs, inflicting injury from the shadows. The Stabbington Brothers also pose no threat as they are only mean looking and ultimately nothing but posers, and the flick also has in its theme to never judge a book by its cover for the dreamers it made out of a tavern full of thugs.If one were to compare the earlier Disney princesses from what has evolved over the course of time, there's no qualms about the female characters being stronger now than their predecessors. Snow White and Sleeping Beauty had unparalleled rivals in the looks department, but ultimately the docile, demure ladies don't cut it nowadays, especially when they are in comatose in their own films, especially the latter almost throughout. Today's princesses fight against bad authority, and are never flinching if the situation calls for self sacrifice. Alas they still cannot shake off emotional needs of desiring a man in their lives, so not all things are changed for happily ever afters.Still, Rapunzel is that worthy addition to the Disney stable, and I am wondering just how long it'll take before she could be found on the Disneyland grounds. Recommended for its intended demographics definitely, while accompanying adults may find that this is no longer the same as those we all grew up with.","

"TANGLED","jayleshd","14 April 2011","After seeing this movie, I felt relieved. After a string of animations, this movie was an example to all those flops of master story telling, animation and script. This movie isn't just for its target group, but for the whole family. Disney has integrated all elements of a pure and honest story. There is action, romance, mystery and all important lessons to be learnt that are of great value to everyone. The pace of the movie is perfect and the direction allows a glimpse into a fantasy world without being over the top. It keeps the viewers attention and wants you wanting more by the end of it. The main character, Rapunzel, is lovable and a strong contender of great animated characters.This movie was universal and if you want to see something that will leave you inspired and talking about to your friends - than definitely go watch this.","

"TANGLED","jeromec-2","2 June 2013","Children's movies tend to have character's that are not very dimensional -- like UP (absenting the first scene which shows how a lifetime of unexpected events often limits our dreams).The best of children's films subtly presents more interesting characters that have more that just 1 set of characteristics. Such a film was Tangled.Rapunzel is astonishing feminine when she cajoles Maximus (the horse) into accepting Flynn Rider as her protector/guide as she makes her way to the festival of the lanterns. She really turns ""it"" on. No guy could resist her combination of innocence and womanliness.My wife made mention of Flynn Rider before anything else. ""Now there is a man,"" was her brief summary of what she liked about the film. He only appeared as superficially very charming to me. Then I saw her point. He does bear a resemblance to Errol Flynn, who was not only charming, but courageous. He treated everything, good and bad, with a basic delight in life.It is the horse that is perhaps the most fun in this film. He had absolutely no dialogue whatever, but he understood everything that was said to him. He had a face that was plastic in origin and conveyed all of his responses with facial expressions. Children's films are masters of speechless communication. The Little Mermaid is almost a perfect example of this genre. So towards the end of her negotiations with him, Maximus lowers his head, flattens his ears and closes his eyes. He knows that his honour as a protector of the realm has been challenged. He knows that she is playing the damsel in distress routine and doing it very well. He knows that she is making a request he cannot refuse. He gives in, but it is certainly against his better judgement. So he shakes hands/hooves with Flynn. He has given his word and he will be obedient to that oath. But he doesn't have to like it.To emphasize the point, he and Flynn exchange shoves and punches on the bridge. They act like a couple of seven year olds. One has to be delighted by such an exchange.The last of the good guys is Pascal, the mood ring with a tail. He is, I think, a chameleon. He too is wordless, but he is not nearly as well developed as Maximus.The men at the inn look like they should be bad guys, but they are not. True, they are capable of drawing swords and maybe using them, but they all have a dream and again it is Rapunzel's innocence that they respond to. Each of them reveals in song what they dream of doing should they be free of their image. They like Rapunzel, but they are not sure of Flynn.The one really ""bad"" guy is Mother Gruthel -- wonderfully voiced by Donna Murphy. She also has the one song that is memorable (Mother Knows Best). She is all oil and false charm and an imitation of motherly love on the outside and all ooze and darkness on the inside. She is a frightening creation.So there's your cast. It's a delightful movie. You don't have to go see this with a kid as your excuse. Just go see it. It's fun for everyone.","

"TANGLED","pursuitforyou","31 August 2011","Let me preface my review by saying I watched this when it finally made its way around to my cheapo movie channel, and I didn't expect to even like this movie much less love it. The characters and acting were much more charming than I expected and funny as well. Loved the slapstick and clever humor. Then, it combined that with sweet tear jerking moments coupled with the fascination of the world that only a child can usually experience. But even for adults, the characters and story draw you into those feelings. And I was constantly amazed at the quality and sophistication of the computer animation. There are many clever aspects to this movie beyond the animation. But suffice it to say, it's a great movie worth seeing.","

"TANGLED","FlixChatter","5 April 2011","Tangled's got everything you'd expect from a fairy tale movie. Obviously you've got the Princess, the dashing Prince-like love interest, the evil motherly figure, the quirky townsfolk and of course, the expansive castle. Originally titled 'Rapunzel', it's based on the classic German fairy tale from the Brothers Grimm of a magically long-maned Princess who's locked in a tower by her wicked, selfish 'mother.' Disney apparently changed the title to be more appealing to boys who might be deterred from seeing a Princess flick. They also argued that Rapunzel isn't the only main character in the film, as Flynn Rider is also featured prominently in the film. Instead of a traditional prince, Rider is a thief on the run who stumbled upon her and inadvertently changed her world forever.Whether or not the title-switch tactic worked, this one was a real winner for Disney. It's grossed more than half a billion dollars worldwide, more than double the cost to make. Yep, 'Tangled' cost $260 million to produce, perhaps a lot of it goes to the 3D rendering, and it shows. The Wiki article mentioned that the filmmakers combined 'the best of both worlds' of CGI technology and traditional hand-drawn animation Disney's famous for and the result is impressive. This is by far one of the most picturesque and colorful animated features I've ever seen and the animation is smooth and seamless. I really was in awe of how gorgeous every scene is, with the night scene of the two main characters on a boat surrounded by lanterns. It was nothing short of magical.This Princess flick has come a long way from the classics as far as the character goes. Rapunzel is a heck of a lot more assertive and strong but never losing her naiveté and vulnerability. She's bubbly and vivacious but not dim-witted. Her interaction with Flynn from the moment they met is endearing right from the start, but it's refreshing to see that she's not immediately swooning over the guy despite he's the first one she's ever met. Flynn is the typical charming bad boy, self-seeking at first but finds his heart over time. Voiced by Mandy Moore and CHUCK's Zachary Levi, it's a lovely combination that's supported by an equally wonderful supporting cast. In fact, the two non-talking animal characters, Maximus the horse and Pascal the little chameleon are such lovable and memorable creatures, while Tony-award-winning Donna Murphy is excellent in the voice role of villainous Mother Gothel.As with any Disney's works, especially when 8-time-Oscar-winner Alan Menken is involved, the music is one of the best part of the movie. All the musical segments are lively and just pleasing to the ear, with 'I See The Light' as my absolute favorite, it was such a lovely duet. The lantern scene when the song appears is my favorite as well, yes it's on the schmaltzy side but you'd be hard pressed to deny its charm.Tangled's plot reminds me a bit of 'Little Mermaid' (a girl longing for freedom and Pascal is like the new Sebastian) and part of 'Sleeping Beauty' (she's separated from her parents all her life), but yet it's still a pretty unique story that kept me laughing and crying throughout. I also like the fact that Disney keeps this one pretty clean and wholesome, as a lot of animated features these days are filled with crude jokes and inappropriate innuendos. By the end I was totally enamored by this movie and the Blu-ray is now on its way from Amazon :) Disney still reigns when it comes to romantic animated features and this one is definitely a keeper for years to come.","

"TANGLED","Lejink","9 April 2020","An apt film, as it turned out, to watch in lockdown, this free adaptation of the old fairy tale for me is the way Disney should be going, finding fresh tales to tell from the great collections rather than remaking their classic animations of the past as real-life features.A winning combination of humour, music and animation, I rate this one of the best Pixar movies I've seen. Personally I do find the depiction of the characters slightly problematic, especially females with their massive eyes and eyelashes just making them, particularly the heroines, too cutesy. Perhaps the same could be said of the heavies whose ugly features are a bit too exaggerated too but I did like the way roguish Flynn / Eugene was shown. As for the backgrounds and individual details, these are pretty wonderful, like the depictions of grass, flowing water and of course Rapunzel's hair. Better yet is the imaginative staging of shots, some taking viewpoints we would now recognise as drone shots while others just demonstrate motion and speed in pleasing and often exhilarating ways, the best of them probably being the flying lanterns, which look like magical dolly mixtures in motion, which, trust me, is a very good thing. I enjoyed the vocal acting, the better for not being done by some megastar who doesn't need the work.The story follows the classic template for this type of film, a young heroine (or hero), striking out for personal freedom, often to right a great wrong, usually against the advice of those around them. Usually too there is at least one and here in fact two cute animal companions, some romantic interest, a lot of feel-good songs, usually by Alan Menken and of course an evil baddie to pursue and thwart the central character until all is resolved for the inevitable happy ending.Of course I appreciate that a film like this isn't aimed at the likes of me but I still enjoyed many of the gags, the songs, even if it perhaps lacks a really big number that sticks in the memory and the rollicking story. Sure some of the individual characterisations aren't too different from what we've seen before but this is definitely higher-grade Disney and a good fun movie to watch at a time like this.","

"TANGLED","jonnyfendi","11 December 2010","I have a friend who asked me, ""Is thiz movie worth watching?"" I said, ""Go and find out yourself. It is Disney , isn't it?"". Not every year, Disney introduces us to their new Princess. It is going to be a magical time of your life, get ready to be part of the history. Do you remember how wonderful is Snow White, Cinderella, Princess Aurora the Sleeping Beauty, Ariel the Little Mermaid, beautiful Belle and the Beast, Aladdin's Princess Jasmine, Pocahontas, Mulan and last year's Princess Tiana and her Frog""? It is the time! For long-haired Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) to get out from her hidden tower, to leave her ruthless mother Gothel and has some adventures along with her Prince, errr.. I mean runaway bandit, Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi). It is also for the first time, Princess Rapunzel will face unfriendly outside world, but don't worry, she's got her frying pan to protect herself and escorted by a very cool chameleon, Pascal and the white horse with dog's capability, Maximus. The song ""When Will My Life Begin"" reflects that great adventure spirit. The Directors are Nathan Greno and Byron Howard who have ever worked together in dog's tale ""Bolt"" (2008). But I think the person who deserves high appreciation for bringing thiz German fairy tale comes to live is no other than Alan Menken. Menken is the regular Disney's genius Composer who can always provide delightful classic elements into every piece of his magical music or Score. The storyline is so smooth and dynamic. Yeah it is predictable, but at least you could enjoy the joyful comedy, it is always fun to watch how Rapunzel and silly Flynn Rider tease each other. And even though without dialogue, the animal characters which are the chameleon Pascal and the horse Maximus perform successful funny slapstick. For the visual pleasure, the picture is beautifully woven to a higher level, you will be amazed by how realistic each texture and detail it has been made, the hair, the grass bit by bit. The most powerful scene is ""The Floating Lanterns Scene"", when finally Rapunzel and Flynn are in a boat right outside the castle, waiting for the glow flying lanterns to be released. In that romantic moment, you can feel the pure sincerity and so much loves between them through their innocence face expression and breathtaking interaction with the background song ""I See the Light"". That scene simply gives you goosebumps and could easily bring happy tears in your eyes. It is very rare that there is a movie that could touch my heart. Thiz one is definitely the one. Usually if someone asks me, ""Who is your favorite Disney's Princess?"". Most of the times, I would answer, ""Cinderella!"". But after thiz movie, maybe I would give a different answer. By the way, I always love the girl with the long hair ^_^ Disney certainly knows best! Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com","

"TANGLED","neenahhh","29 January 2011","And a kick-ass one, at that! Tangled is the modern version of the old fairytale classic- Rapunzel. I've forgotten what the original version of Rapunzel was, but I know that it certainly wasn't this one. Disney did a good job in making this movie. They added the plot with the hair and I loved the whole thing with the lanterns! A big plus was that all the songs were catchy! None which I can see as classics, though like ""A Whole New World"" or ""Colors of the Wind"" or etc. But they were still good. Good enough for me to want to have that album.The plot wasn't exactly A+. It was average. Not that I'm complaining since this movie's target audience ARE for the kids. I didn't hate that evil witch, by the way. I thought she did a pretty good job. I mean, she was willing to go and trek 3 days for paint that Rapunzel wanted? Most evil stepmothers wouldn't do that! (Certainly not like that bitch in Cinderella, OOPS.) But not this woman. She showed that she cared. That's why I wasn't really hoping that she would die. Halfway throughout the movie, I was even thinking of ways on how this movie could end happily, without the witch dying. ""Maybe Rapunzel's real family will let the witch work somewhere in the castle and Rapunzel would sing for her weekly!"" Hey! It seemed like a good idea to me!The humor was indeed funny. I think both adults and children would enjoy it. I loved Maximus! Max's relationship with Eugene sort of reminded me of Shrek and Donkey. I liked Maximus more, though, since he wasn't annoying. It was a good call for Disney to NOT make the animals talk this time. That gets annoying.I also liked the big hair change Rapunzel had. This movie proves that hair can really do a lot to a person. With her long blonde hair and gorgeous green eyes, Rapunzel looked like a child with no knowledge of anything. She was a child. But after her hair was cut, she looked like a new person! She looked more mature and a lot more edgy. Eugene did a good job. I teared up in the ending. What can I say? I'm a sucker for family scenes.This was a great movie. It isn't showing in the Philippines yet, but I think I'll still watch it when it hits theaters next week, even if I already got to watch it. :) Good job, Disney!1st viewing: January 29, 2011 ; 2nd viewing: February 5, 2011","

"TANGLED","tavm","2 December 2010","This was the first of two movies I watched with my movie theatre-working friend today (The other one was Faster). The trailers made me wonder if the whole thing was gonna be a little too slapstick for my tastes but having now seen it, I shouldn't have been too worried as it had an equal amount of heart, drama, action, and, yes, laughs. And knowing Disney veteran composer Alan Menken was involved with the songs-with the help of lyricist Glenn Slater-made this film even more enjoyable especially when the number of ""I've Got a Dream"" was performed by a bunch of bar customers that were considered monsters before that. Of the voice actors, I knew ""Chuck""s Zachary Levi was the leading man because of his spots during his show that publicized the movie and about Mandy Moore playing the long-haired princess from some sites but I didn't know about Brad Garrett, Jeffery Tambor, or, best surprise to me, Richard Kiel whom I've long loved for his portrayal of Jaws in both The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker (When I mentioned the last to my friend, he says he doesn't remember those movies or maybe he didn't even see them, I don't know). Anyway, that's a high recommendation for Tangled.","

"TANGLED","filipemanuelneto","30 November 2016","This film is a reinterpretation of the traditional Rapunzel tale. Far from being just a children's movie, its a film for the whole family and has space for everything: it has songs, a beautiful novel, a well written script, good action sequences, hilarious moments... Basically, is one of the most positive and innovative Disney films in years.Disney has had serious difficulties in recent years. Difficulties with his rivals (particularly Dreamworks) and some internal problems but, mainly, a kind of existential crisis where the creativity of his team was disappearing and giving us absolutely lamentable films. But this movie was a kind of turnaround, with the studio showing the public that its not yet exhausted. Returning to their own origins, which are the traditional children's tales, Disney artists sought to write a story that appealed to children and adults, and to look at the stories from a more current perspective. Thus, we can find in this film a Rapunzel that is dreamy, imaginative but not naive, shy but full of confidence and personality. After all, if the woman stopped being the weak sex and started to have a strongly active position in our society, why would not that be reflected in children's tales? It was a radical but positive change, which alters our way of seeing the story and allows us to play with it, inserting moments of action or humour.Rapunzel is on the same level as Flynn, a rogue trickster she knows and who will try to help on her trip, and whom she saves in some situations. Mother Gothel is another important character for being the villain. Her characteristics are selfishness and vanity, but she's also somewhat seductive. In certain scenes, the way she seems to use seduction to achieve what she wants is halfway between the lines. Maximus, the guards' horse, has the mannerisms of a rowdy dog ​​and the intelligence of a human being, and can be highly hilarious.The moments of action were well heeled, perfectly mixed with comical scenes without exaggeration. The jokes are intelligent, without falling into the temptation of easy laughter or being a goal in themselves. The animations and designs are excellent, with a graphic that reminds us of some of the films of Disney's golden age. The songs are good, they stay in the ear but they are far from the successes of the past.","

"TANGLED","mark-4522","11 May 2020","Tangled wasn't as big a success as Frozen perhaps because while watchable, it didn't pander to what successful Disney films engage in: Fantasy elitism. Even as the films required some sort of quest for the heroine to achieve (or preferably, a dragon for the hero to slaughter), there's a secret desire for kids to never have to grow up and earn a living. Even in this film, Rapunzel lives a pretty easy life in the tower but there are no parties and friends to marvel at her dresses and singing.What makes this film special is that the villains and heroes, even the rogue, engage in psychology we see in everyday life. The gaslighting performed by the witch should be required viewing for psychology students. The rogue who attempts to dissuade Rapunzel from her quest tries to scare her while it hilariously backfires. It's like the writers were remembering all of their childhoods.That kind of savvy commentary flies over the heads of most kids (and even many adults) but there's plenty of great music, endearing characters, and solid jokes to keep it moving but not perhaps sell as many toys or get girls excited about a life of leisure on a reality show. It's more healthy, but less addictive. The diet-Frosted Flakes of Disney entertainment.","

Rapunzel on a pink front cover doesn't convey laddish testosterone. So I reluctantly gave in and watched it...and oh boy I'm glad I did. Disney keep astonishing me with their animations, I really shouldn't be surprised anymore. A reinterpretation of the story of Rapunzel, a princess kidnapped and locked in a tower where an evil woman utilises the power of her hair to remain youthful. A nearby thief encounters the tower and is locked in a promise to guide her to the neighbouring kingdom, against the behest of her ""mother"". Tangled singled handedly put Disney's animation catalogue back on track after many lacklustre titles during the mid 00s. Incredibly easy to see why, this animation had it all. Developed memorable characters brimming with personality and harmonious voices, apparently everyone can sing in this kingdom. Ranging from royalty, thugs and peasants to a determined stallion and an expressive chameleon, this array of colourful characters breathe life into the plot. A fleshed out story dealing with dreams, internal conflict and romance. A witty screenplay boosted by sarcastic dialogue that creates plenty of smiles and laughter. Whether it be the various inaccurate wanted posters of Flynn, ""that smoulder"" or the constant requirement and usefulness of the average frying pan, it's these little details of self-awareness that enhances a basic narrative into the realms of memorability. The animation was absolutely stunning, plenty of fluid motion. The scene involving the lifting of lanterns just floored me. Beautifully crafted. The musical numbers were catchy which is all one needs for a Disney musical. Sure, the plot was predictable and the ending was far too rushed (underwhelming demise of the antagonist) but these shortfalls hardly detract from a entertaining animation that the whole family can enjoy. Well, maybe I should tackle 'Frozen' next...","

It's quirky enough for children to enjoy, but at the same time there's enough action and dialogue to allow older crowds to enjoy it as well. I loved it. The color and texture of colors were fantastic. I mean, I could honestly sit here and spoil the film for everyone, but I won't. It's definitely worth the watch, so if you have not seen it, I highly recommend it. Even for a Friday night film.

"TANGLED","KineticSeoul","29 December 2010","Now this is a very generic and predictable adventure and if you seen enough Disney movies, it's obvious the stuff in this have way too many Disney cliché going on. But the thing is, it's still a magical adventure and is still worth seeing it in 3D despite the narrow and predictable story. At first I was just going to pass on this movie, but the 260 million dollar production value got me interested. And let me tell you, this movie is just gorgeous to look at with some amazing and fluid animation. And despite the Disney cliché, it has elements that kids will most definitely enjoy and most adults will have a good time as well. All the audience in the theater seemed to have a good time watching this, so if you want to watch a movie you and your kids will enjoy I highly recommend checking this out.7.9/10","

"TANGLED","mac_canon","6 February 2011","Well this was about as good as it gets. Great story, beautifully told, great pacing, lots of funny moments and characters. Some very touching moments too. It really does have it all. Drama, romance, obstacles etc. The best film I've seen in ages. There some goodies around at the moment too. Great for all the family.I love how good Disney are at getting the audience onside with their characters. They are masters of this. Anyone with a soft spot for the good old Disney films will be well satisfied after seeing this. Great voice actors too. I take my hat off to the actors that give these characters so much life and believability. I will definitely be adding this to my Blu Ray collection. It's a gem.","

"TANGLED","movieman410","18 September 2012","There are Disney films you watch as a kid, that you watch it again as an adult several years later, it holds up and sometimes even better. I stopped pretending I ""outgrew"" Disney. I re-watched Disney films last year, starting with Hunchback of Notre Dame, which is awesome.Tangled is a little different. I was a 17 year old well into High School, so of course I wasn't going to rush to see this film. I pretty much avoided it, but two years and several positive reviews later, I could no longer avoid it. I watched it and...I LOVED IT! It doesn't matter if it came out when you were in high school, I'm 19 and in college. I saw it last night, and I loved it. I can't explain the film, don't read people's opinions, go watch it, with no word on what everyone else thought. Just watch it and see what you think for yourself, right now! I don't know why I love it but I did. Enough said. I heard it has some problems, but I ignored those flaws. My two all time favorite films; ""Lord of the Rings"" and the ""Dark Knight"" have flaws and plot holes, do I think less of them for that? Of course not! I kept an open mind for Tangled and got sucked in to this film and loved every minute of what I saw.I will definitely watch it again. If you think you ""outgrew"" Disney, watch this, and you'll change your mind. Trust me.","

"TANGLED","Benjamin_406","5 December 2010","Right after Disney's acquisition of Pixar and ""Meet the Robinsons"", Walt Disney Animation Studios were on the right track of finding its true identity, under the watchful eyes of Ed Catmull and John Lasseter. First, ""Bolt"" and ""the Princess and the Frog"" became better than ""Meet the Robinsons"", earning high level of critical acclaim. Now WDAS' 50th animated feature, ""Tangled"", is not only the best WDAS film of 2007-2010, but, too, a rare film that gets to rank among films from the Disney Renaissance - mainly, ""the Little Mermaid"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"" and ""the Lion King"".If you think I'm talking crazy about Tangled's ranks among the Fab Four, then there are things that you might want and need to notice: finding one's true identity as the main story theme, cleverly executed humor, strong and appealing personalities of the characters, immensely fantastic music and songs, infinitely superb character designs (under the supervision of Disney animator Glen Keane), emotion-stirring moments, and MOST IMPORTANTLY the reinventing of everything in the move. As a big plus, stereoscopic 3-D enhances the humor, the action, the magical moments and the tear-jerking moments of the story, most notably the lanterns in the ""I See the Light"" sequence.There's a special difference between ""the Princess and the Frog"" and ""Tangled"". TPATF emphasizes on elements of Disney tradition (princes and princesses, certain talking animal sidekicks, and toe-tapping songs) over the theme of the story, whereas ""Tangled"" emphasizes on the story's theme over the elements of the film's tradition. That qualifies the film to become an instant animated classic among ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""the Lion King"".I used to be concerned on Tangled's story structure as below the potential of Toy Story 3's story structure, but after a lot of positive reviews and ratings, I now believe that this deserves to have the insurmountable love, much like the Fab Four.","

It's not just because I thought Flynn Rider was a gorgeous animated character only, but because the movie itself was great. The storyline was great, and I prefer this over the original Rapunzel storyline. The movie got me teary a bit, but that's just me. I'm quite sensitive to movies like this. I think I've watched it six times now, and I haven't gotten tired of it. The soundtrack is great too! Different varieties of music incorporated into the movie. Probably my favorite Disney from now on. :)","

"TANGLED","fati-279","2 April 2014","I love the movie ""Tangled"". This movie sums up to: A very good work of animation with detailing. Good story line. Adventure and Romance. Love and betrayal. Comic elements and saddening truths. Songs that are melodious (I just love humming them). Magic that heals. Horse that is Amazing. Bad guys (who aren't bad) and have ambitions. Bad guys (who are bad and evil). Thief (who is HERO, the Flynn Rider (Eugene)). Lost Princess who is kept in the tower all her life. Long hair that are magical and healing, and Anti-aging. Witch that Rapunzel thinks is her mother. Dance and Music that is entertaining and enjoyable. Innocence that is in Rapunzel, and how it reflects in others. Lanterns that fills the sky on Rapunzel's birthday. All in All, a perfect movie to watch.The magic words that heal: Flower gleam and glow, Let your power shine.. Make the clock reverse, bring back what ones was mine!!! Heal what has been hurt, change the fates design.. Make the clock reverse, bring back what ones was mine!!!Song that feels: And at last I see the light. And it's like the fog has lifted. And at last I see the light. And it's like the sky is new. And it's warm and real and bright. And the world has somehow shifted. All at once everything looks different. Now that I see you.A family entertainer, one you can watch as many times you want. Because I myself have watched it like 4-5 times, and I still love it.","

"TANGLED","rgcustomer","4 January 2011","I actually didn't know anything about this film except that it was in 3D and had something to do with Rapunzel, but it had a high IMDb rating, even from old men, so I trusted you guys and I went to see it.You were right. It's an excellent film. Even if it had no story at all, it is worth seeing for the spectacular art that it is. It does have it's misfires (one small scene with water looks more like cellophane, and a spider web looks like something from a 1990s video game) but these stand out particularly because the rest of it is just so beautiful to look at. I'm fairly sure many of you will shed a tear or two, just from the beauty.Everyone will comment on the nighttime floating lantern scene, which is truly beautiful. My one concern is that with the similarity to Avatar's wood sprites, this might be becoming a cliché in 3D animated film. Of course, we could do a lot worse than to have such a good cliché.The villain in this film has a spectacular death scene. Maybe that's playing it up too much, because it's fairly simple, but the imagery is just right. I'm certain this will be remembered.The actors ... I mean the animated characters are drawn very well. But animating this close to reality is a delicate act. Some things don't work when they get too real, like exaggerated features. There are a few moments when maybe their teeth get too big and the distortion makes you a bit nauseous. Same with the eyes. You kind of wonder why they didn't just use real people. But then it falls back into place again, and it's wonderful. If you thought you might have fallen in love with one of Disney's 2D characters (come on, you know you did) wait till you see this. Flynn (why are all Disney characters recently named Flynn?) may not have the perfect body (it's a kids' show) but it's not bad, and when that face is up in yours in 3D, how can you not want to kiss it? I'm sure Rapunzel is all that too. But that's not how my boat sails.Is this the first 3D film to include a gay bar? Sure, they don't SAY the Snuggly Duckling is gay bar, but do you need them to? There are no women in it until Rapunzel shows up, and all these very butch men have these very artistic dreams. And it's the Snuggly Duckling. Good for them.Oh, and it's a musical. Or is it a movie with music? Whatever. The songs are pleasant. I enjoyed them at the time, but I can't say I remember any of them now.I saw it in 3D, but I suspect it is equally as good in 2D. For Avatar, I would say the 3D is an essential part of the film's immersive experience, whereas for Tangled, it's more of an enhancement. But they have done it right, by building it in from the start.I should say something about the story. Although based on Rapunzel, this is not the usual Rapunzel story. This version relies on magic, which if it wasn't so well done, I would normally regard as a negative. The ending is also somewhat different, but amounts to the same thing.I do suffer a twinge of guilt knowing that a quarter of a billion dollars was spent on a kids' film, instead of on, say, healthy food and education. But at least it was done well.It's a must-see film, certain to please almost anyone.","

This movie is not meant to be taken seriously, which really adds to the comedy. As kids movies go, this is one of the better ones.

"TANGLED","Zac_La_Porte","4 August 2021","Tangled certainly appears as an ordinary ""lost-princess"" tale, which would be a reason for anyone to avoid. However, it's actually an amazingly moving animation with gigantic heart and genuine excitement. For children, teens and adults, this Disney journey is a sensational experience; definitely a must-select for family movie nights.Starting off with what this film would be completely dull without, is the animation. Because it's seriously not just the beautiful, bright and adorable visuals; it's pretty much every single segment that animations use. Alongside the visually phenomenal detail, the voice performances are beyond perfect. The striking voices of Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi and Donna Murphy each perfectly fit their charming characters. Plus there's a perfect, simply perfect, selection of bright songs with appealing lyrics.Many kids will believe they're too grown up for an old Disney princess story, but any age and anyone can watch this movie. It's likely they'll finish feeling surprised at how great and fun it was. Tangled isn't a constantly-dramatic princess whining about the tower she's spent her life in; it's a positive and charming girl who is a princess without knowing it, who was kidnapped as a baby and has been raised by a strange and kind of creepy woman, Mother Gothel. The film's adventure is packed with uplifting messages, which are also improved by the voice acting. You'll undeniably adore this magical and lovely story.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","

"TANGLED","Danusha_Goska","19 December 2010","""Tangled"" is a very, very pretty movie. The lantern scene, Rapunzel's tower, the castle interior – all very nice to look at. The heroine is genuinely adorable, and the hero is really handsome. The script is sweet and funny. The songs fit their scenes. Rapunzel's animal companion, a chameleon, was adorable and different – it did not talk, except through very articulate facial expressions. The chameleon did not have supernatural knowledge; it learned along with Rapunzel.I enjoyed ""Tangled"" a lot, but the storyline didn't have the focus or power that would have made it a classic for me. I wasn't scared by Mother Gothel. The extreme exaggeration of the animation distanced me. Did Rapunzel's and Mother Gothel's eyes need to be THAT big? And what country in Europe, which is where this story originated, have such wildly exaggerated topography? Overall, though, this film is better than most. It's just that I did like it so much I wanted it to be a classic.","

"TANGLED","LeonardKniffel","4 May 2020","This Disney creation features the magically long-haired Rapunzel, who has spent her life in a tower but is about to discover the world-and herself. The strong ""prince"" character is not a prince at all, and Rapunzel, while a princess, is more independent that many early Disney princesses. This story is likely to appeal to boys as well as girls. ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013","

"TANGLED","threedbomb","9 January 2011","This review won't really be useful to many people as I come at this film as an animation student. There have been precious few 2D or 3D animated productions that cam capture your heart and mind. We have the giants like Spirited away and Grave of the Fireflies in the 2D world and really anything from Pixar except Cars to love. Precious few others. Ice Age nailed it but most Dreamworks productions fail to capture the sheer brilliance that can be a character in motion. Despicable Me is another that just brought the characters to life and here with Tangled, we have that same excellence in character animation. Every character from the adorable chameleon to the angry horse are characters you'll love, not because of the story but simply because of the level of animation at play here.There's an extra level of realism in this movie that you don't normally see too. There are moments during the movie where a characters face isn't seen and you lose sight of the fact it's just stylized 3D animation. The water scenes are particularly stand out brilliant cinematic moments with incredible realism. These scenes must have been globally illuminated to death. I dare not guess how long these frames must have taken to render.But just like any special effects heavy movie, without a great story and equally great performance, you'll soon tire of it. Tangled doesn't disappoint there. The story is great fun, inventive and very much a wild spin on a very old fairytale. The performances from the real voice actors are devilishly good. It's surprising there weren't more BIG names doing the voices but satisfying to know that this really doesn't matter. The actors aren't phoning in these lines, they are nuanced, operatic and multi layered really helping give the animated characters much more depth.For me it's the tiny moments that make the movie, not just the great slapstick moments but the way the characters emote. Rapunzel isn't sure of a new character entering the scene? Sure she has that look of trepidation and fear but the emoting is so dynamic and rich that you can almost see the characters thinking their emotions through from moment to moment. It's quite intense and I found myself a number of times being drawn towards the screen, feeling what Rapunzel was feeling. Almost mirroring the emotions as you might do with while talking to a great friend or partner.So as I said at the beginning, this review probably not going to be so good for the average viewer wanting to find out whether to take the kids to see this but if you appreciate animation as an art form or even appreciate the technical skill involved in animation as pure entertainment. You must see this, you must go and see it again and then you must buy it, download it or otherwise get your hands on this and have it in your collection for happily, ever, after.","

Romance out there - like watching ""Titanic"" for the first time, as a catharsis - a scene of incredible beauty, when the sky lifted hundreds of paper lanterns ... Breath catches in delight and touching fragility of this moment, and as the sun touches the heart.And if you have not touched this Sunbeam - do not miss by far the best cartoon of the year.

Tangled is an excellent movie, with a deeply touching plot and the most wonderful music (well OK, it's not amazing but still very good) and characters that bring life to the once known as boring fairytale Rapunzel. SouthSideChgo-Disney puts twists in every story! That's why people like it! You should appreciate their creativity! Personally I love the contrast between low-life thief and high-flying princess-it simply shows its not your position that decides your love and personality! I really love Flynn's charming personality and Rapunzel's tough-chic yet sweet style of doing things. Pascal and Maximus are two of the most amusing animal characters I have ever seen. The animation is smooth and gives a real fresh feeling for such an old tale. The original songs are entertaining. It's literally flawless! Tangled certainly beats any other animated Disney movie-a fresh, fun twist on a old, almost gloomy tale. Well done Disney!","

The humour was well done, and some of it subtle for the adults.My daughter laughed out loud at the wardrobe gag (watch and you'll know which part I'm typing about), & the interplay between the horse and Flynn.My wife and I enjoyed the story and the comedy was done that it enhanced the story. It didn't seem that this was a case of throw thousands of sight gags, one liners and set pieces and see if any stick.Now it's a Disney movie so you know Happy Ever After is pretty much guaranteed, but it's a fun journey to get there!

Hope you will make more nice animated movies as soon as possible.I would recommend this movie to anyone with any range of age without hesitate. Everything at this movie is just-great. Feels we are in that location and we are a character of that movie.My rating 10/10 (If I could give 100+/10 I would do it too) Best Animated film at all time ! Thank you for all","

I even laughed many times throughout. The romance between Rapunzel and Flynn is beautiful and makes them my favorite Disney couple. I see the light has to be one of the best Disney scenes in history. Speaking of music, it's fantastic! There are even action scenes that are so intense!One of the best Disney films to ever exist!","

"TANGLED","anaahnu","19 October 2016","The story of a young woman, escapistic and romantic (well, would you expect something else from a girl who was sixteen years locked in a tower?) She quickly gets to the real world, discovers how unpleasant and dirty it is, but in some way ""infects"" the brutal robbers with her naive, blonde and ruddy optimism. There are also conflicts with other not-so- pleasant people (the Horse, and Mother Gothel, of course), but in the end, all that Shrek-like mockery becomes a parody of itself. It does, though, merge very well with romance and all that mi-mi-mi stuff. So, the film is recommended to be seen both to the viewers who like spiteful twists over traditional fairy tales, and to the ones who just like a good bedtime story. You'll not be disappointed.And -- Aw for that old man with angelic wings: he's the most fascinating robber ever!","

"TANGLED","SquigglyCrunch","24 November 2016","Tangled follows a woman named Rapunzel who is raised in a tower all her life but one day meets a man called Flynn Rider whom she recruits to take her outside the tower. Quickly I wanted to appreciate this title. I never really thought about it, but it is pretty clever. After having long hair I can relate to it and sympathize with Rapunzel so much more. If having hair only down to my neck gets tangled, I can't imagine her trouble. The characters are a lot of fun to watch interact with each other or indulge in their own thoughts. Since Rapunzel spends some time alone in the tower, that aspect has to have some focus. She's a super fun character in the movie, and she works really well with Flynn's character, who is also a lot of fun. He's one of the only sane characters in the movie, but he's still kind of insane, so he fit in just fine. These characters were all pretty well-fleshed out and thus, I felt the feels fairly often. In particular I felt tears twice in this movie, even though this was the third time I'd seen it (but the most recent). The comedy works really well. It fits the movie, and is often situational, so it flows really well. While it isn't an incredibly funny movie, it at least doesn't try to force jokes into the story. It takes them as they come. But the humor wasn't the only thing that made me smile. This is such a fun movie, and I found a smile to be very present throughout it. The soundtrack is a lot of fun too. The songs aren't gratuitous or overdone, and often serve the purpose of driving the plot or developing a certain aspect of the story, all the while poking fun at itself, specifically in the form of Flynn Rider's character. Plus Disney just got good voices to sing the songs. Unfortunately, sometimes it was a little too obvious that the character's voice actors weren't always singing the songs, but that was only on one occasion. There was one thing I didn't notice the first couple times I saw this movie, but Disney dares to dip it's foot into the waters of maturity. Without spoilers, it briefly deals with the idea of unhealthy, potentially abusive relationships. It's done mostly through imagery, and isn't blatant, but I definitely noticed it, and I kind of respected it more for that. Plus it just fit the movie as a whole. If I have but one flaw with this movie, it's the method of Rapunzel's big realization at the end. It makes sense, sure, but it's still a little far fetched. As for the ending itself, it's pretty generic in terms of these kinds of movies, but it's still amusing. Overall Tangled is a heartfelt, fun movie. The soundtrack is fun, the characters are fun and engaging, and the movie strikes up genuine feelings. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie.","

"TANGLED","Robert_duder","28 March 2011","Like any child I loved Disney films and I turned into an adult that adores the classic Disney films and hope to share them with my children one day. But could they keep creating the classic films we all know and love from Snow White and Bambi to modern day classics like Aladdin and Beauty and The Beast? Well the answer is absolutely!! Tangled is the first Disney animation film I have seen in quite some time and I was glued to my screen the whole time. Funny, cute, romantic, thrilling, adventurous, edge of your seat, and stunningly beautifully animated and this only begins to describe Tangled. I saw elements of Aladdin, Beauty and The Beast, and even The Lion King in the style, story and characters the film makers created. Like many Disney films it draws on a classic fairy tale and brings those characters to life in such a larger than life way. I saw Tangled on Blu Ray which certainly helps the quality but throughout the film I couldn't stop being awestruck over the quality of the animation. I believe it is traditional hand drawn animation but just...wow...from Rapunzel's doll like features, to the breath taking Kingdom they live in. Kids will adore it and adults will never take their eyes off of it.Zachary Levi is already high up on my hero list as I am a huge Chuck fan and recognized his voice immediately. But regardless of this his voice talents to the egotistical, romantic thief Flynn Rider is just perfect. As much of a fan of his that I am I forgot about him and he simply became Flynn Rider to me and that says a lot. Mandy Moore seems to have slipped out of the spotlight lately. But she comes back strong as the naive, lovely, young girl Rapunzel with the magnificent hair. I wasn't sure about her voice at first but she is perfect and their voices come together to create a terrific chemistry opposite each other. Donna Murphy plays the voice of the obligatory 'witch' or evil 'step mother' as the case may be. Murphy is a terrific character actor and has been for years and she is perfect behind the face of Rapunzel's captor. And of course any great Disney film needs a handful of talented supporting voices and they include Ron Perlman, M.C. Gainey, Jeffrey Tambor, and Brad Garrett to name a few of the more well known and noticeable performances.Only Disney can create characters like this. Other film making companies make good animation but does anyone even touch these guys? This film packs so much adventure into one movie just like you'd expect and demand from a Disney flick. There has to be a 'but' since I didn't score it a perfect ten and that 'but' happens to be something that is also a Disney staple and that is the music. I didn't think the music in Tangled was very impressive at all. The best song was the song in the tavern with all the brutes because it was fun and light hearted but none of the songs stayed with me or stuck in my head and I am certain there won't really be any songs that become classics. So its unfortunate that the music stumbles but everything else about this amazing film makes up for it. Constant adventure!! Boys, girls, men and women will find something they love about it. There are some definite dark turns in the film especially near the end where our hero Flynn is stabbed...so be warned with the really little ones but otherwise Disney swings and knocks another one way, way way out of the park. I LOVE IT!! 9/10","

"TANGLED","MLDinTN","29 August 2011","Even though I'm not a kid, I thought this movie was good. Much better than what I've seen lately. It had good animation and a worthwhile story that's a little different than the usual Rapunzel tale. Here an old woman finds a flower than makes her eternally young. The king's men find the flower and use it to save the sick queen whom is having a daughter. The daughter is born with golden hair that has magical powers. The old woman steal's the girl and keeps her hidden in a tower, where Rapunzel grows very long hair and the woman uses it to stay young.On her 18th birthday, Rapunzel wants to leave the tower to see the sky filled with lights. A thief, Flynn, finds the tower and sneaks in. In some very cute scenes with a frying pan, Rapunzel gets Flynn to take her to see the lights in person. Once the old woman finds her gone, she starts to track the 2. So, Rapunzel finds all that she's been missing in the world and well you guessed it, learns her mother was keeping her hid for her own selfish reasons.Along the way, there are cute scenes and a couple of good songs. But most important, it's just a good story that makes sense.FINAL VERDICT: A cute animated movie. Check it out.","

"TANGLED","inkblot11","19 December 2011","Princess Rapunzel (Mandi Moore) has been locked up in a tower since she was a baby. That's because Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) stole her away from her royal parents shortly after her birth. Why did she do so? Because a magic flower that restores youth was given to the pregnant queen, since she was gravely ill, and Rapunzel's hair now has that magic, with the help of a special song. The young lady's only companions are her ""adopted"" mother and a darling little chameleon, Pascal. However, through the tower's windows, Rapunzel has seen that lanterns are launched on and only on her birthday. A coincidence, maybe? Perhaps. In any case, the Princess wants to go outside the Tower for her 18th birthday present. But, Mother Gothel won't hear of it. She sings a song about the perils of the world, from poison ivy to quicksand, and tells her daughter NEVER to ask such a thing again. Disappointed, Rapunzel tries not to cry. The next day, when MG leaves to gather dinner fixings, Rapunzel is surprised to find a young man, Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) has scaled the Tower's wall to evade the Palace Guards. Flynn, you see, has stolen a crown, and is in trouble. Never having seen a man before, Rapunzel manages to knock him out with a pan and lock him in the closet. Thinking quickly, when Mother returns, the Princess sends MG away on a hunt for white dye, a three day journey. Its Rapunzel's plan to ask Flynn to show her the lanterns and, indeed, the world. It begins well. Mother leaves, Flynn helps the Princess down and the vacation starts. But, all too soon, MG returns, surmises what has happened, and is hot on her daughter's trail. Of course, she is not alone, as more men are chasing Flynn, too. Time after time, the duo is in peril. Will they escape and will Rapunzel learn who she truly is? This outstanding film is so adorable that every viewer will, in turn, sing out its glories to the next potential fan. Moore, Levi, and Murphy are terrific in their important roles and they can warble like the most melodic of birds. The supporting cast is fine, too, as is the animation, script and direction. As for the music, it is so exquisite that a special Nobel prize should be created for Menken, the composer. He is one rare earth commodity and he is ours, an American. (The lyrics are also quite nice). In short, untangle your feet from the couch cushions and go get Tangled at once. What a treasure it is!","

"TANGLED","paul_haakonsen","2 March 2011","""Tangled"" is an instant classic. It is right up there with the likes as ""Mega Mind"" and ""How to Train Your Dragon"".The story told in ""Tangled"" is the classic tale of Rapunzel locked away in the tower, and we all know that one, don't we. But ""Tangled"" is more than just another re-telling of the classic tale.The animations and drawing style in the movie is really nice, and I liked it right away. Lots of vibrant colors and beautiful details in every single scene. And that is something that works well.And the characters in ""Tangled"" were lovable, even the villains. Everyone was colorful, interesting and brought their own unique touch to the story and the movie. From the animals to the people, everyone was just fabulous. I especially liked the chameleon and the horse, they were really hilarious and had really fun poses and faces.The voice acting in ""Tangled"" was quite nice as well, and they had a bunch of good names on the list.""Tangled"" is definitely a movie that should be in every movie aficionado's collection. The movie is the type of movie that you can watch over and over again, proving that Disney still can make instant classics.If you haven't seen ""Tangled"" already, get in gear, and watch it. It is truly a spectacular animated movie with a lovable story and even more lovable characters.","

"TANGLED","aesgaard41","3 April 2013","What can I say about ""Tangled"" that has not been said before about every other Disney movie before it. Like every fairy tale before it, liberties were taken with the original tale to expand it into a movie, the animation is breath taking, the actors and characters are excellent and it has its own morality tale behind it as usual. The songs are memorable but not as infectious as anything from say ""Aladdin"" or ""The Little Mermaid"" and much like Ariel and Jasmine, Rapunzel has a certain buried sexuality about her when she's not bouncing around like a Disney Channel pop star on soda and candy bars. The characterizations and mannerisms are fun to watch of course; at times, you forget these are animated characters. You can really see the efforts the animators made to have these characters move, react and respond like living people. The best parts mostly surround the character of Rider with the horse Maximilian and how Rapunzel reacts with her color-changing chameleon. I watched the movie because I like to see how far the animation is coming, and Rapunzel's ridiculous long tresses look perfect, but the story itself is just as much fun to watch.","

"TANGLED","jboothmillard","6 February 2011","When I read that Disney were going to make a new film about Rapunzel, I assumed it was going be hand-drawn animation, but it turned out to be computer animated, but I was still going to see it. Basically a magic raindrop falls to the ground and creates a new magical flower that can heal injuries, cure the sick and prolong youth, the elderly Gothel (Spider-Man 2's Donna Murphy) wants this flower herself to give her everlasting youth and beauty. But the flower is taken by the kingdom palace guards looking for a cure for the sick and dying pregnant queen, and after being cured by the flower's magic, she gives birth to the baby girl, Rapunzel, who absorbs the flower's abilities in her golden hair. Finding this out, Gothel kidnaps the baby in order to use the powers of her hair for herself, and she takes her to a hidden tall tower that is well hidden and no-one will ever find to raise her as her own daughter. Eighteen years later, Rapunzel (A Walk to Remember's Mandy Moore) has grown her hair to a humongous length, and she still believes the horrible Gothel is her mother, and with the insistence of her mother stays trapped in the tower to spend her time singing, painting, reading, and looking out the window wondering what is outside. She finally plucks up the courage to ask her ""mother"" about the lights she sees rising in the sky every year on her birthday, she doesn't know they are floating lanterns released from her real home at the palace, hoping she will one day return home. Of course Gothel strictly forbids Rapunzel from leaving tower being greedy for the power of the hair, but soon enough when she is alone, dashing thief Flynn Rider (Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel's Zachary Levi) climbs the tower to hide. Desperate to see the rising lights up close, and with her ""mother"" gone for three days, she makes a deal with Flynn that if he takes her to where the lights come from, she will give back the priceless crown he has stolen. So begins a treacherous journey to the kingdom, Rapunzel has mixed feelings about disobeying her ""mother"" and leaving the tower, but she knows she has dreamt of leaving for years, and Flynn is very wary for his sake as well, being a wanted man. When she returns to the tower, and gets back up via the secret entrance, Gothel sees that Rapunzel has been taken away, she at first believes she has been kidnapped, but then she spots her ""daughter"" singing about her relief to be out. After so many chases towards the kingdom, the two thieves that were originally with Flynn join Gothel to capture both him and Rapunzel, they do manage to get to a boat and see the floating lanterns, and they are getting very close as well. Rapunzel is fooled however into thinking that Flynn does indeed still want to crown, he is tied up and captured ready for execution (by hanging), and she is taken back to the hidden tower believing her ""mother"" was right all along. But Flynn manages to escape, and rides back on once rival now friend horse Maximus, while Rapunzel finally realises that she is princess to the king and queen, and of course that Gothel kidnapped her for her hair's abilities. In the end, when Flynn is near death he cuts Rapunzel's hair, turning it brown and taking away its power, Gothel falls from the tower to her death, Rapunzel saves Flynn from death with the flower abilities in her tears, and she returns to her true home to marry Flynn. Also starring Ron Perlman as Stabbington Brother, Jeffrey Tambor as Big Nose Thug, M.C. Gainey as Captain of the Guard, Brad Garrett as Hook Hand Thug, Paul F. Tompkins as Short Thug and Richard Kiel as Vladimir. The voice talent are all great, including of course singing their own songs, Gothel is a particularly nasty villain who enjoys it, and the animation is fantastic, especially if you see it in 3D. The most spellbinding sequence is all the floating lanterns surrounding the couple falling in love with the beautiful Oscar and Golden Globe nominated song ""I See the Light"", it is a family film that shows fairy tales are still possible to make, an enchanting animated comedy adventure. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Film. Very good!","

"TANGLED","Doylenf","31 March 2011","TANGLED is much more than ""a drop of golden sun."" It has a flippant, modern attitude in all of the dialog, a crisply appealing and smartly styled animated technique that brings the characters to life, and a pleasant score by Alan Menken that captures the essence of the fairy tale story in street smart style. In short, it's an instant classic for today's movie fans.With talented voice chores performed by ZACHARY LEVI, MANDY MOORE and DONNA MURPHY, the characters are given full-bodied images that are uncannily real. In fact, the chemistry between Flynn Rider (Levi) and Rapunzel (Moore) is a gradual thing (not instant falling in love as in most Disney features), and blends and ripens convincingly for the tender moments that follow.And aside from the key human characters and a horse named Maximus, there's plenty of fast-moving adventure as the evil Mother Gothel plans on keeping Rapunzel at her side forever as a way to retain the magic powers of her golden hair, lest she shrivel away to an old hag. And within the texture of the plot is always a sense of humor from either one-liner wisecracks or the animated expressions of the humans and Maximus, the stubborn horse.Easily one of the best animated features to come out of the Disney studio in some time despite the fact that the score is not as strong as other animated classics. Nevertheless, it has action and romance and an astounding beauty in its magnificent settings and polished art work.Absolutely a must for any animation fan.","

"TANGLED","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","24 June 2011","Rapunzel doesn't remember her royal parents(why is it that ""destiny"" is always a big, positive one?), as she has been locked away in a tower since infancy, trapped there by a witch(who has a habit of disappearing using her cloak, I guess she doubles as a ninja) who pretends to be her mother so she can remain young, using the girl's magical hair and its healing properties(nevermind its ridiculous strength or the changing back and forth between her roots feeling any pain from pull or not). She does wonder about the outside world(albeit she does know things that one wouldn't think she would, given that she's been indoctrinated against leaving), and when Flynn, a young arrogant thief, hides in her place of residence, she forces him to take her outside. There are more details, but that's the gist of it. I haven't watched much of anything by Disney since Hercules, especially since they went from 2D into CGI, and I see little has changed since my last dip in the pool. Don't get me wrong, this does look pretty good. Nice use of brightness/darkness of color, some memorable designs and the general animation is great. I can't comment on the acting, as the cut I viewed was dubbed into Danish. Anyway, the material is ""safe"". Over the top stuff, silliness, and in general mostly for the kids. I saw most punchlines coming, and this garnered one or two chuckles out of me, nothing more. The plot developments aren't that unexpected, either. We have a horse that acts like a dog(a bloodhound, to be exact), a chameleon as the sidekick(...I don't know, I guess they're just drawing them out of a big hat with ""animals"" written on the side) even though they hadn't thought of very many gags where that comes into play(even fewer that are at least decent... and you could excise it from the script, with nothing changing by it), and a sweetened take on an old fairy tale that had merit on its own, and will henceforth be known in the mainstream by the sanitized, corporate-approved version. With all that said, the pacing is quite reasonable, and this goes into compelling themes(and explores them rather well), such as the fear of age/death, growing up and youth rebellion. Like I said, par for the course. Not better or worse than the general piece by the studio. There is a little mild violence in this. I recommend this to fans of the work and legacy of ol' Walt, and/or of the original story. 7/10","

She is just so damm likable. She is funny, awkward, qirky and very interesting. I find the prince and side characters pretty decent as well. The villan is actually not bad, all thoufg not the best. Rewatching it again, I stilk enjoyed it, but not as much as the first time round. This is dinsey's first CGI princess tale. I must admit that I do mish the 2D animation of princess films and Princess and the Frog tried ro bring 2D back, but wasn't sucessful in doing so. I must admit that I did enjoy the 3D animation of this film,particularly Rapunzul's hair. It was very fluid when her hair moved very nice. But the only issue's I found was that the pacing did slow down at times in the middle of the film, resulting in it being a tad boring. But my gosh, the story is just too good. I do recommned this film. I think both boys and giels will enjoy it equally. 😁👍🏾","

She was a princess who had been confined in the tower in the deep forest for 18 years because of her magical hair. I liked this distance between nature and civilization, I meant the kingdom. It made me feel like I saw a different world. I feel wonder and dream because there are undeveloped regions like ""Princess Mononoke.""I was fascinated by unique and cute characters she met on the way. One of them was a one-armed pianist and another was a strange pantomime actor. I really like these playfulness of Disney. My favourite was a big man loves unicorns. I was surprised at the physical ability of Maximus, a horse chased around Eugene, the theif, with insistence.An action scene in the canyon was intence and worth seeing! I wondered how the location setting was. It looked too clean and tidy though. Was it based on Grand Canyon or any mountain dams?","

"TANGLED","Byrdz","3 February 2016","Yes ! You read that correctly ! If for nothing else, watch this one to see THE HORSE !!!! His name is MAXIMUS. He is a very large white horse with attitude. He moves like a dog and he seems to think like a dog as well. He snuffs along the trail of the hero.. At one point he even sits on his haunches and when that sweet spot under his chin is scratched, he starts to kick himself with a hind leg. Found him IRRESISTIBLE !!! He and the hero have a brief Wile-E- Coyote / Roadrunner encounter on a tree branch. SUPER ! Oh, Tangled also has a very appealing Lost-Kidnapped Princess as Heroine and a delightful smoldering (his word) thief turned hero. The hero's gang of miss-fit-thief pals is supercalifragilistically amusing. There is a good ensemble song as well. Almost forgot the Villainess (hissss booooo). She looks a lot like Cher and sings up a storm like a Broadway Diva. Again... TERRIFIC ! Disney required mascot, Pascal (a chameleon) this time around is rather over-shadowed in appeal by Maximus. Remember him ?. He just turns colors and makes hand movements that aren't really clear as he only has two fingers and little hands.The animation is incredibly well done. There is a frying pan (with a large part in the proceedings)that looks as it it is really there and mighty even be a real frying pan. All the marks and dimples are just right. the scenery and special effects are also ""just right"".There is a trio of little girls who have their day made when a lady with 70 feet of shining golden hair enters their city.Little ""bits"" abound in this wonderful and rather neglected film from the Disney Company ... their 50th Animated offering and for me, one of their best.","

"TANGLED","JohnDeSando","24 November 2010","Flynn Rider: ""You smell that? It's part man-smell, and the other part is really bad man-smell, but overall it just smells like the color brown. Your thoughts?"" Tangled is not the Rapunzel story your mom grew up on. As the above quote attests, Disney has post-modernized it with updated, semi-hip dialogue and some Freudian notions that fit the story's thematic base. Disney has made a fun movie of an old fairy-tale chestnut, not as complex as Princess and the Frog, but good enough to be the studio's 50th animation and going strong.How does 26 years old Mandy Moore's voice sound like 18-year old's? It does, and I'm impressed with the whole angle of vision that emphasizes the needs of pre-teens and teens to bolt from the nest and see the world as it is, not through parents' eyes, while promoting the value of family, real family that is.Supposedly the visual style, an effective use of 3D, has the properties of ""The Swing,"" a romantic painting by Jean-Honore Fragonard. Whatever, the hair of the two leads, and even wicked ""mom,"" is textured and layered in a most realistic,yet romantically stylized fashion.Disney is canny enough to use Rapunzel's hair as a weapon, similar to Indiana Jones's whip, to take the staid glam out of its tradition and make it useful for more than a ladder. Even the sidekick chameleon, to be almost as welcomed as Donkey in Shreck, has reactions reflecting the modern cynicism rather than the cute simpleton.In its further favor, the love between the two teens is not in the Twilight longing motif—it rather it grows organically from a mutual respect, not lust divorced from the idealized bodies Disney distractingly offers in its animations. In short, your thinking youngsters should love the ironies Tangled offers while it entertains with patented Disney humanity.","

"TANGLED","ForTheMostPart1999","7 November 2022","Probably the best princess-themed movie I've ever seen. Disney Animation Studios never fails to disappoint with pretty much any their movies. I've always loved the childhood classics such as The Lion King and I still love those movies today, especially ones by Disney themselves. As for this movie, it had a very neat story of Rapunzel and her insanely long hair. Some fun witty moments throughout the film and even some neat action scenes as well. Nice and detailed characters as well. The animators especially did a good job with Rapunzel. Overall, the 3D animation was extremely detailed (also hearing that it was the most expensive 3D animated film). Flynn Rider was also a fun and funny character and one of my favorites in the movie. The rest of the characters were all pretty unique. Great heartwarming songs and music as well. Very touching and, once again, a great classic. Let's also not forget that this is Disney Animation's 50th film.","

"TANGLED","antec84","10 April 2011","Being a 26 year old male that usually finds action/scifi type movies more preferable, I did not expect that I would end up liking this film. My dad set up a 3d projector system at home and we've been struggling to find good 3d content, so as a last effort a week ago we purchased Tangled 3D. After watching the film at length, I was pleasantly entertained. A lot of animated children's' films seem rather cheesy to me, but this one was different. I would have to say that the film excelled in character development, and that was what set it apart from many others. The characters have memorable personalities that draw you in, and overall the film evokes a dynamic range of emotional sensationalism from comical, to happy, to sad. At its conclusion, it leaves you with a feel-good type of movie-watching experience. Altogether, the textures and the 3D looked gorgeous on our home 3D system. Overall, definitely a film worth having. You will not be disappointed.Thats it for my 2 cents worth.","

"TANGLED","3xHCCH","19 January 2011","""Tangled"" is Disney's latest film, but unusually it is not a highly hyped as previous Disney films, at least where I live. I did not really like the nondescript generic title, which does not say anything much about the movie at all or even hint at its creator, Disney. Upon watching the movie, we see a spin on the fairy tale of Rapunzel. Rapunzel becomes a princess here, in the Disney tradition. The male protagonist is played by a charming (again in the Disney tradition) outlaw Flynn Ryder. The elements of the Rapunzel story are all there: the long hair, the locking up in the tower, the teardrop at the end... But Disney gives these things a very interesting magical back story (again in true Disney form). To make the boys come and see the movie, they include an exciting and funny action story with Flynn Ryder character, complete with thugs and chases.I personally like the non-speaking animal characters a lot -- the cute little chameleon Pascal and the mighty royal steed Maximus. I never did like those other noisy annoying sidekicks in previous films too much. The songs are not too memorable unfortunately. They tend to sound alike already, don't they? The action can tend to be a little graphic here, meaning there are lacerations and stabbing with blood, and you actually see what happens to the witch when she falls out of the tower -- unprecedented stuff. It is in fact the first Disney princess film to get a PG rating.It is a marked improvement over ""Princess and the Frog"", Disney's last film. It is not to the level of ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Little Mermaid"" and ""Mulan"", but ""Tangled"" is a landmark film in Disney history, as they finally enter into 3D CG animation territory. The effect of this animation vastly improves the quality of action scenes (like the breaking of the dam) and the magical effect of the poignant scenes (like the floating paper lanterns). This film is well worth its price of admission. It is fun, funny, exciting, romantic and touching, everything you will be looking for in a Disney animated feature film.","

"TANGLED","ShelbyTMItchell","11 January 2011","A take on the Rapanzel tale. If you read fairy tales as a child. You see that, the prince rescues the damsel in distress. Well this girl acts anything BUT one.Rapanzel, the main protagonist, voiced by Mandy Moore who also sings. Is locked away in the castle by her ""mom,"" named Gothel, who is the main antagonist. Who is longing to see the outside world despite warnings from her ""mom"" that, the world is cruel and full of cruel people. She wants her daughter to believe. But that isn't the real reason why, as you will see.Of course, it wouldn't be Rapanze without her long hair. Which has magical powers. That helps to heal people, among other things. For also her hair helps Gothel be young and vibrant! She stays in the tower for eighteen years and on her eighteenth birthday, she asks to venture out but again, to nobody's surprise, she is yet denied.Meanwhile a thief, who takes the name of Flynn Rider but that isn't his real name. As you will see what his real name is and how he took that nickname if you see the movie. Steals a tiara from the castle, among many other things he has stolen from the castle. BTW, the castle also plays a huge part in the movie. Not just while he steals things.The thief(voiced by Chuck's Zachary Levi), comes across the tower where Rapanzel has been for all of her life. Climbs up there as a place to hide. Only to be knocked out and tied. Rapanzel makes a deal with him. To show her the outside world, and she will give him back the tiara. Untying him, he reluctantly agrees.Despite feeling guilt, but feeling free she has now seen the outside world. She and Flynn enter a tavern despite some trouble from some rough thugs, some were trapped allowing Flynn to escape along his many misadventures. And seek revenge on him for the things that he has done against them, like going back on his promises to helping them. In order to help himself escape.But her singer and jubilant attitude calms the mood and people down. But low and behold, Gothel is after her. After finding out she isn't at her tower. And with the help from the two thugs that were with Flynn over the tiara. And want revenge on him.Meanwhile, the two begin to know one another. And of course, fall in love. But those hindrances could break them up. Will Rapanzel and Flynn's love friendship and love stay true and keep them together? Or will Gothel's secret about needing Rapanze's hair, along with the castle trying to capture Flynn. Plus, possibly having ties to Rapanzel possibly, keep them apart.It is a good movie. Very cute. As well as a good love story. With wit and charm. It has a twist to it. Not like the original Rapanzel story you have come to know and love. But you will love it!","

"TANGLED","joliefille411","2 January 2011","Tangled is above all else a masterpiece of animation and background. I'd never say another thing about cg again if there was a hope that even a quarter of the stuff churned out looked so stunning. It could have been a much worse film in other aspects and I would still be drooling.Which makes it even better that it doesn't suck as much as the trailers imply. I have no explanation to offer for the crap job done on the marketing other than everyone other than the artists are a bunch of greedy bastards. Anywho, it's a charming story, not nearly as snarky and Shrek-ish as I had feared, filled with some excellent characters. Mother Gothel is an excellent villain, combining charm and evil marvelously. And as for the titularly tangled couple, both are serviceably great in a not-too-terribly-bland way. Maybe a little too quippy for their own good, but oh man, they boast some of the most attractive character design I have ever seen. There seems to be a lot of lifting from anime, with the huge saucer eyes and heart-shaped faces. The voicework was in many cases good, better than I was expecting to say the least. Donna Murphy was, of course, great and I like Zachary Levi well enough from his role as Chuck, but Mandy Moore was the sleeper hit. Frankly, all she had to do was not suck it up and I would have been floored. I still would have liked to see Kristen Chenoweth in the role, but Moore's voice definitely had a stronger note of sincerity and thankfully the nasally pop-tartness was for the most part absent in her singing.And the songs! Actually, I am afraid to admit I cannot remember a single tune from the show, which I just saw this afternoon. I remember them as pleasant enough at the time and know I liked Mother Knows Best quite well, but they just didn't stick with me. Instead I've been humming True Love's Kiss all evening, being in the spirit of the movie while infinitely more catchy.So all in all, Tangled was a worthy placeholder in the coveted 50th feature spot. If it had any faults, which were few, they can all be forgiven by the sheer beauty of the artistry, which really is the whole point anyways. At least if you ask me.","

"TANGLED","tieman64","15 March 2012","""The one thing that the public dislike is novelty. Any attempt to extend the subject-matter of art is extremely distasteful to the public; and yet the vitality and progress of art depends largely upon the continual extension of subject-matter. The public dislike novelty because they are afraid of it. It represents to them a mode of Individualism, an assertion on the part of the artist that he selects his own subject, and treats it as he chooses."" - Oscar Wilde ""Believe in the character. Animate with sincerity."" - Glen Keane As Pixar becomes evil, Dreamworks and Disney's animated features seem to get better. ""Tangled"", based on the German fairy tale ""Rapunzel"", is perhaps the studio's best animated film since ""Bolt"", though both are still far too manic, the products of a popular culture that has been reduced to an Eternal Now, where noisy, shallow entertainments constantly give way to replacements that are only superficially distinguishable from their predecessors. Disney, and all of modern culture, works hard to create an audience that values artificial newness and not much more.This kind of creepy replication is at the heart of ""Tangled"", a film which sees a cute princess, Rapunzel, kept in a constant limbo so that an evil witch may be rejuvenated over and over and over again. Rapunzel and her handsome prince's willingness to stick to formula, to remain frozen in character, is what enriches the witch, her body growing like some kind of bulbous, perpetually expanding Disney bank account. It's only when Rapunzel and her man break away from their roles – she transforms from hermit to princess, he from bandit to prince (itself formula) – that the cycle is destroyed.The plot's mostly junk, but aesthetically this is an exquisite, gorgeous looking film. The man responsible for this is master animator Glen Keane, who has little to no prior experience with computer animation. The result is that ""Tangled"" uses no motion capturing and has a visual style that hearkens back to Disney classics of yesteryear. Disliking the ""sharp"", ""straight"" look of computer animation, Keane issued a mandate for soft, round edges, organic looking movements, and warm hand drawings whose lines and colours resemble that of traditional oil paintings on canvas. Beyond this, the film treat us to richly rendered forests, super expressive characters, an eye-popping colour palette, whispery light effects, and sexy greens, pinks, blues and whites. The film's character animations are themselves very good, particular an odd horse that behaves like a bloodhound, moves like a laser beam and seems designed to mimic the upper body of a chess piece. The human characters are a delight too; visually it's a good film.""Tangled"" was the first Disney fairy-tale since ""Beauty and the Beast"", which was released way back in 1991. Since those straight faced, earlier Disney films, Disney has slipped into the grip of post-modernity. It's princes and princesses now know that they're ""princes"" and ""princesses "", constantly indulging in sarcastic, ironic, pop-culture referencing winks. Thankfully ""Tangled"" does go too overboard with this, and when it does the gags and jokes mostly work well, as do some of its parody's of modern Broadway tunes. And as with most computer animated films, the virtual camera work here is super fine-tuned, everything ultra choreographed, which lends both the film's action sequences and exposition a special visual kick. All this comes at a cost: 260 million dollars for this baby, roughly three times higher than your average Pixar budget.This being Disney, the film is overtly sexual, with phallic towers, sexually manipulative women, fertile valleys, wide eyed couples and strong, sexual currents. And as with most modern Disney films, which get increasingly self-referential (""Bolt"" was itself rife with films within films), there's an unintentional meta-plot going on, our animators' love aligned to Rapunzel's love of 2d drawing, of art, which escapes its prison and bursts into a 3d fantasy world of criss crossing spatial axes. Incidentally, Disney's previous ""princess film"" was ""The Princess and the Frog"", an offencive little Obama-era film about a ""black princess"". In comparison, ""Tangled"" is hyper white. Like brushing your teeth with bleach while the KKK eats mayonnaise on your lawn. Only whiter.8/10 – Worth two viewings.","

"TANGLED","bendy392","7 June 2014","Disney's 50th full length animated feature. And with it, they decided to head back to what Disney did best: a fairy tale. This one being based off of the story of Rapunzel. You know, the girl with the God knows how much feet of hair? Yeah, that's the one. Also, this is Disney's first time of putting 2D animation to 3D. If you can tell, the designs of the characters look like they're from 2D. I mean, Rapunzel DOES look a bit like Ariel, doesn't she? Anyway, let's jump into the story.Once upon a time, there was magic flower that a witch, named Mother Gothel, has been using for centuries to keep herself youthful. Eventually, a kingdom grew and the queen falls ill one day while pregnant. The King's men then find the flower and use it to heal the queen, who then gives birth to a girl, named Rapunzel, who possesses the magic within her golden hair. Gothel realizes that Rapunzel is now her only way to stay young forever and breaks into the castle, kidnaps her and takes her to a tower in the middle of a wilderness, where nobody will find them. Gothel convinces Rapunzel to continue to grow her hair otherwise it'll lose its power. Rapunzel then notices that every year on her birthday, she sees lanterns flying in the sky, which are actually launched by the kingdom so that one day, the lost princess will find her way home. Rapunzel wants to leave the tower and see them, but Mother Gothel constantly forbids her from leaving—that is, until a thief named Flynn Rider, breaks in and Rapunzel convinces him to take her to see the lanterns. From there, it's a grand adventure with colorful characters, comedy and of course—romance.This story is GENIUS and the characters are so memorable. Rapunzel is very likable. She's smart, funny, adventurous and has a real kind heart. Everyone she meets likes her, including a bunch of ruffians and a mad horse. Also, I think she is one of the best female characters ever created. I mean, yeah, she has her insecure Disney Princess moments, but later near the climax, she stands up to Mother Gothel, who emotionally abused her for so many years, and she SCOLDS her when she learns who she really is. So yeah, I think she's a well written character. Flynn Rider is also likable. Most of the time, he's played for laughs, but aside from being a snarky ladies' man, he has his development. Throughout their adventure, he starts to have feelings for Rapunzel and hell, he ends up saving the day at the end. Also the romance is good. Yeah, it's a typical Disney-not-even-a-week-later-romance, but in the end, you don't really care. In fact, they don't even get married. At the end, he PROPOSES to her. Even the comedy is hilarious. There's a horse named Max, who comically plays the ""Captain Ahab"" character, who is obsessed with hunting Flynn. Whenever you see him and Flynn together, it's just hilarious.How's the music? While I DON'T think it's the best soundtrack from Disney, it has a beautiful score ""I See the Light"" and I think it's one of Alan Menken's finest work. Even when its playing, the animation is glorious when you see the floating lanterns. And speaking of the animation, another brilliant moment is when you see Rapunzel's parents, who never say a word in this movie, but when they're crying, it's REALLY powerful. You can see the pain in their eyes like they're about to give up on the search for their daughter.The villain, Mother Gothel, is also a great character. She's cunning and manipulative like pretending to be Rapunzel's mother, but she can also snap at anytime, asserting her psychological abusive relationship with Rapunzel. And at times, she can actually be pretty funny. But aside from that, she can get pretty dark, like when she straight up STABS SOMEONE IN THE BACK. Yeah, blood and everything. How often do Disney villains stab someone in the back?!So is this movie ENTIRELY flawless? WellI only have two problems with this movie. Flynn Rider's real name is revealed to be Eugene Fitzherbert. Honestly, I don't see a point in him having an alias. When we were introduced to this character, we fell in love with Flynn Rider, not Eugene. In popular media, he's known as Flynn Rider. Hell, people remember him as Flynn Rider. I guess you could argue that him confessing his real name was a sign that he's growing more feelings for Rapunzel, but then again, that's kinda a nitpick. My other problem is the marketing. For example, look at the trailer. The one where it ONLY showed the comedy. That didn't look like a Disney film, it looked like a crappy romantic comedy made from Dreamworks. I'm sad to say I fell for this at first and I didn't bother seeing Tangled until years later and— heh, wasn't that a mistake. Plus, this movie didn't become number 1 at the box office until its SECOND WEEK. The marketing also didn't really say much about the return to the classic Princess fairy tale, they only showed the comedy relief and Flynn Rider being a smartass and that was about it. If the marketing for it was to say that it's one of Disney's finest since ""The Lion King"" or ""Beauty & the Beast"", people would be more willing to see it. I wish that this movie got more attention than most others, but it does have quite an audience. Most say that this movie is far from the films that were made in the Renaissance era, which really shocks me because this one is SO good. The characters are great, the story is great, the villain is great, it's really a gem. I've sat down and watched it numerous times and when it comes again, I will gladly watch it from beginning to end.","

"TANGLED","jwv-823-79715","10 January 2014","As the film starts, so will I start by saying that I really like the frame narrative. Everybody will be able to connect with it because of its reminiscence with bed-time stories, and it neatly ties the beginning and the ending together.Throughout the film, there's a great momentum of action, singing and character building. The film succeeds in portraying likable, believable and funny characters that, although they may be cliché-esque types, do convince. The dialogues too may make you suffer from a certain feeling of déjà-vu, but they are witty, and the songs are enjoyable (props to Mandy Moore), with the usual accompanying trademark funny scenes. The voice-acting is top-notch, as are the sound-effects and the soundtrack, which provides just the right tune for just the right occasion. Going on about aesthetics, the animations were colourful and enchanting with jaw-dropping detail (which makes for an awful lot of beautiful screenshots for fans).The story is no big mystery or surprise, even for those who are not familiar with the fairytale itself. The film however, does a great job of keeping it interesting with several sub-plots and an occasional plot-twist. It is the story about the confrontation between a naive teenager and the world, and also about the adolescent's growing awareness for the other sex. Tangled is a great example of the genius, albeit quite clichéd Disney formula of success on its best. We recognize the story of a sympathetic protagonist searching for freedom, and exploring the world. He or she encounters several evil characters on the journey, but in the end wins out over them, not only because of his or her intelligence and perseverance, but also by charming others with their innocence, likability and lack of prejudice.This mix of elements forms the basis of the trademark Disney formula, with which Disney here proves they utterly ace the art of pleasing a mass audience, all age categories included.","

This movie proved me wrong.However, it could very well have been my hesitation and low expectations that led me to enjoy it so much that first time. That does not explain the absolute love I have for this movie in my multiple rewatchings of it.On the surface, it could be your basic movie. However, it's when you think about it, that's when it snares you. The villain in this movie is so much more frightening because I can relate to the dynamic between her and Rapunzel. The subtle abuse (and it is abuse, even if it is emotional) just chills me to the bone.This is also the first Disney Princess Movie I can recall (Mulan notwithstanding) where it was not all about the love story. The love story wasn't secondary, but it worked well in tandem with the story that ran parallel with it. (Plus, I'm a huge sucker for stories where the love evolves, almost as I adore Unrequited Love.)There are so many points I can make about this movie. If I sat here and listed them all, I could probably have it published.One note, though. While Maximus was awesome, Pascal got on my nerves to no end at first. Over time, he's grown on me.","

Let's not even get to those straight-to-video sequels and spin-offs (of which only a tiny few were likable). This is Disney's first major CGI movie. The success of it may set a new trend for future Disney films as a result of which I'll miss the beautiful hand-drawn works that contributed in making classics of so many of their older films.However, the animation in 'Tangled' is first rate and definitely up their with Pixar. The enchanting fairy tale world looks colourful and magical. The details and movements are very well done. The story is told in a very Disney fashion with added tongue-in-cheek humour and the occasional songs. The songs contribute well to the story-telling and the jokes work effectively. There are a few plot holes but given that it's based on a fairy tail (Rapunzel) these things can easily be overlooked. The voice acting is very good. Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi are adequate as the typical Disney princess and Disney hero. However, Donna Murphy steals the show as the evil Mother Gothel and the supporting cast is great. Brad Garrett's Hook-hand thug is hilarious.My favourite character was Rapunzel's chameleon sidekick who provides some excellent subtle comic relief and Max, the horse.

That is until, the rakish rogue Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) lands on her doorstep.Blackmailing Flynn into escorting her to the palace, Rapunzel gets her first taste of the outside world, and all its perils.By modernizing the character, her powers, and her purpose, Tangled takes the famed fable beyond its lofty confines, while adhering to standard Disney song and dance.Although, I do hope that Rapunzel's carpet doesn't match her drapes.

"TANGLED","johnnyboyz","9 December 2011","Disney's latest is a feast for the senses in as much one cannot deny its colour; exuberance; 'crack on with it' attitude and generally fun, frantic nature - but this is all it is in regards to that age-old ""feast for the senses"" line, as I cannot say I felt a genuine nor heartfelt taking to it like I can to some of their other works and nor can I muster a reaction along the lines of being particularly moved. The film is sassy and effervescent, a film in the Disney mould of its depicting the adventures of a young, often socially starved by her father/mother, heroine getting caught up in all sorts of plots and pratfalls with a range of oddball folk along the lines of Aladdin; Pocahontas and The Little Mermaid resulting in change and great adventure. The film follows that of the Mandy Moore voiced Rapunzel, a young girl who lives with her mother and steadily approaches her eighteenth birthday. Only, she doesn't actually live with her mother but a faux-incarnation of a mothering figure – the dastardly Gothel (Murhpy), who begins the film as a haggard elderly lady before finding a magical flower enabling her to become young and stay young. In order to do so, she must constantly harnesses the power which comes about to be imbued within that of the infant Rapunzel's hair, a catch which is brought about when Rapunzel's REAL mother harnesses the life from the flower herself so as to keep her alive during childbirth. With Moore's character possessing a sort of trichological Holy Grail, and having been stolen away from her true parents, of whom look suspiciously like the king and queen out of 1959's Sleeping Beauty, she finds herself locked away in a tower by herself at the bereft of the person she presumes to be her true guardian.The heroine on this occasion isn't the best of young female leads that the American animated movie making corporation have ever come up with. Cut from a stone more akin to that of a recent, Disney-mass produced 'conveyor belt' generation of young women along the lines of Hannah Montana and Selena Gomez, Rapunzel is a po-faced; ""Best. Day. Ever!"" quipping poster child incarnation more broadly representative of this and is disappointing in this light. She is, however, ridiculously talented in an array of fields which range from astronomy (perhaps at a time before most astronomers did what they did?) to dress-making; her burgeoning young adulthood cranking things up a gear when she desires to step outside of the proverbial bubble, much to Gothel's disdain when she realises the magic she possesses will go with her.In essence, we have a film about a young girl wanting to grow up coming up against an elderly woman wanting to grow down – that is to say stay young. Said dynamic brings about the film's best song, ""mother knows best"", in a sort of verbal psychoanalytical orgy of why young Rapunzel should stay locked in the tower with her pet chameleon rather than get out and explore as she approaches adulthood like she wants to. Unfortunately, and on a much more detrimental note, we have had the likes of Black Swan released in 2011; the 'sordid' mother-daughter relationship here paling in comparison to Aronofsky's forcing drama with the whole thing, of which plays such an important role in the piece overall, landing at our feet more damply than what would have been away from exposure to said piece.Respite in Rapunzel's world arrives with that of Flynn Rider (Levi), a cocksure young thief who's a lot more handsome than his two criminal cohorts and manages to steal some valuables from a castle and get away again before having the gall to double cross his partners in crime and make off. Flynn stumbles upon Repunzel's little hideaway in amidst the hills and forests and renders it his own to lie low – and that's when all the trouble starts. The sub-plot to do with the kingdom's chase, eventually led by a cross pollination between a horse and a bloodhound named Maximus, whose clothing sticks true to his name and sees him decked out in Roman Centurion-esque garb, to get the valuables back and Flynn's own double crossed friends chasing him down does well to intermingle with the central tract of Rapunzel's coming of age story and what eventually transpires on that strand.We enjoy Rider and Repunzel's coming together extending beyond that of the tower's domain, something which kicks off an adventure similar to that of when Princess Jasmine and Aladdin first met and came to bond – the gimmick here seeing neither of them know of the other one's true-to-life foundations in royalty. I like the fact that her aforementioned trusty pet chameleon, Pascal, is mute; thus, I make it, rendering Tangled the first Disney film since that of Pocahontas to encompass creatures of the animal world whom do not speak. Where we might have had a hair-brained, fast-talking animal sidekick doing whatever, Pascal cuts a silent and often cheeky looking figure – a character who's all hand gestures and facial expressions, a character built on comedy of a more physical nature and making him infinitely funnier than a what might have been. The film, branded proudly by that of Disney themselves, is their fiftieth; if the run were a so-far indelible cricket innings by that of an individual batsmen, then Tangled is the nick along the ground for four runs through the slip cauldron thus proudly bringing up the half-century and enabling the player to raise his bat more than it is the imperious cover drive to seal a landmark. That said, the film comes with a buoyant energy; a charming love story and a fun chase narrative on top of a fair few laughs that compensate for a few lacklustre songs – it is worth a go.","

"TANGLED","SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","14 December 2011","Reading some of the reviews for this you may expect the start of a new wave of Disney brilliance. What I saw was Disney playing it safer than they have ever done before. Everything is the same, but worse. Worst of all are the songs. I pick up songs very fast. I can hear a song once and hum diddly hum it weeks later. The songs from Tangled are about as memorable as, well, if I could remember something so unmemorable it would kind of undermine my point. The film also has the least threatening of all Disney villains. With none of the menace nor charm as some of the classics, Mother Grothel is just someone you don't like, rather than fear and despise. The humour is immature and wreaks of 90's post-modernism. This same kind of narration was used in Happily N'Ever After, and there's a reason you haven't seen that film. Even the story itself is stretched and involves a bunch of lifeless characters that are overshadowed by a chameleon and a horse. The animation is fine, the voice work admirable, but this is a hollow and bland film.","

"TANGLED","nicole-m1994","9 April 2013","Seeing all of these reviews posted by adults about how boring or lack-luster this movie is is ridiculous. It is meant for little girls to watch, and I think it succeeded. My niece absolutely loves this movie, as I'm sure many other little girls do. I can honestly say that I love this movie as well. I think it is a cute movie, and sure it has it's cliché moments, but then again, how many movies are completely 100% original? Do some research and you'll find that almost every movie follows the exact same pattern.As for some reviews about the body image issue, I believe this movie does more help for girls. At the end when she cute her hair and it turns brown she id STILL looked at as beautiful an officially regains the princess title with her short brown hair. I personally believe that should strengthen a little girl's self conscious. As for people complaining about graphics and the ""unrealistic nature"" it is a kids movie. It is called a cartoon for a reason..and that isn't because it is supposed to look like a real human. The scenery looks pretty real to me, as well as some of the character feature, and although the proportions may be off it still catches peoples' attention.Overall I love this movie and seriously cannot understand why so many adults are critiquing it so harshly when it is primarily made for kids! I know my niece loves it and its such an awesome feeling to cuddle up with her on occasion and watch a movie that we both enjoy so much.","

"TANGLED","Mr-Fusion","18 February 2015","As recent Disney movies go, ""Tangled"" is largely forgettable stuff. It looks like your typical CGI kids movie, and there's not a lot to these characters or the story.But my kid loves it, so they must be doing something right. She usually gets a kick out of Flynn Rider's antics - particularly the ""smoldering"" scene and when he gets a frying pan over the head and stashed in a wardrobe. Which brings us to the movie's real charm: Zachary Levi, who makes Rider a likable guy and infuses this movie with much-needed personality. The guy's just plain charming, and his contribution to this movie cannot be understated.5/10","

"TANGLED","Movie_Muse_Reviews","28 April 2011","It seems to have taken until the eleventh hour, but Disney has finally found a way to make its classic fairytale stories work in the 21st Century. Thanks to longtime Disney animator Glen Keane (serving as producer) and directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard (""Bolt""), the film stays true to Disney's long line of rich fairytale history while adding a distinct layer of action, adventure and humor that modern audiences now require.2009′s ""The Princess and the Frog"" marked a complete return to traditional animation for Disney and received much praise, but the film continued the trend of moderate and unsatisfactory box-office success for fairy tales. All hope seemed to be pinned on ""Tangled"" to revive the genre or it would surely hit Disney's back burner indefinitely. Once titled ""Rapunzel,"" Disney's strategy for this film was clear: appeal to a wider audience. Zachary Levi's character Flynn Rider, a sharp but self-absorbed thief, became a focal point of the marketing, and while this is Rapunzel's (Mandy Moore) story, he does play a more prominent role than a large segment of Disney princes from over the years. In short, ""Tangled"" appeals to boys, girls and the whole family.Disney has never been known for defying stereotypes, so in that sense, the complexity of Rapunzel and Flynn should be a lauded accomplishment. Like most princesses (or so it seems) Rapunzel is a naive dreamer who sings about longing to see the outside world from her tower, but she's quick with a frying pan (as a weapon, not cooking utensil) and her hair possesses a surprising amount of dexterity. It's rather unrealistic how well she handles the outside world considering her overprotective and narcissistic mother (Donna Murphy) has bred incredible fear in her, but she's by far the most 21st Century princess to date. As for Flynn, despite the cockiness, deception and excessive charm, he has a down-to-earth dry wit too that makes up for his over-the-top nature.The story carries a surprising amount of intensity and emotional pull. With Mother Gothel and the two thug twins in pursuit of Rapunzel and Flynn as they venture to the kingdom so Rapunzel can see the ""floating lights"" that come out every year on her birthday, there's no shying away from dark elements. The possessive mother motif always works to make you sick inside and considering Rapunzel's sweet nature, you really do wish ill on Mother Gothel.In terms of the animation, ""Tangled"" feels traditional, but it's a good thing. Keane has worked on countless of the Disney classics of the '90s and he finds a way to adapt that style while using computers. The result is that familiar richness and magic of a hand-drawn animated film with the photorealism and attention to detail of CGI. With big round eyes, all the characters earn our sympathy quickly and make ""Tangled"" as enchanting as it is action- packed and exciting.As Disney has always done with exceptional skill, the non-verbal but human-like animal characters vastly increase the humor of the film. Paschal the chameleon and Maximus the royal steed both have unpredictable dispositions that make them fun and lovable. As a chameleon, Paschal likes to instigate conflict but quickly recoils and turns the shade of objects around him when he's nervous. Maximus takes it upon himself to track down Flynn with a sense of self-importance, yet he's a sucker for normal animal pleasures like being pet and apples. The brilliance of these characters never fails and will always be part of the Disney legacy.So sigh relief if you're a Disney fairytale fan, because ""Tangled"" has finally found the answer. Some die-hards will insist on more memorable songs and musical numbers (even with a couple of excellent Alan Menken tunes, especially ""I See the Light""), but the trade off (as seen with a ""PG"" rating for the film as opposed to all previous fairy tales earning a ""G"") is something more compelling for all audiences.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com","

"TANGLED","rrrrox","28 April 2011","This movie is just brilliant! I'm not going to say anything about the plot or the characters in particular, just that they are perfectly created! They are so easy to like, the dialog is really smart and funny, the songs are very nice and they stick with you even after the movie has ended.It's a movie any age can enjoy because it makes you laugh, feel joy and hope and it makes you smile, but it also keeps you in suspense and wondering what happens next. Like I said before, the dialog is very and I mean very funny, and I recommend everyone to pay attention to the facial expressions of the characters which are simply hilarious!! Ever since I was a kid (I'm 23 now), Beauty and the Beast has been my all time favourite animation movie! It still is but I have to say that Tangled is pretty close in taking its place, and it's definitely the best/funniest/smartest animated movie I've seen in the last 5-10 years!Definitely watch this movie, no matter what your age or gender is, there's no way you won't enjoy it! I'd give it a 20 out of 10 if it were possible!!P.S: As if the story, the dialog and the video weren't enough to make this movie so wonderful, the cast is also perfect! The voices suit the characters so well that I can't imagine other actors doing them! Thumbs up for the chosen cast!","

So when I went to the cinema with my mum to see it, I went in with a mixture of hope, excitement and dread. The lights went down, the movie started and an hour and a half later, I waltzed out of the cinema in a blaze of happiness, because I knew that for the 50th time in 73 years, Disney had produced an animated masterpiece. The music and songs, composed by Alan Menken, are as good as any from the Renaissance. The plot, while originally being rather ""Grimm"", is slightly altered in this movie but still true to the story in essentials. The movie, all in all, is a balanced blend of action, comedy and romance and I loved it.","

"TANGLED","jfgibson73","24 April 2011","This is probably the best animated film since Finding Nemo, and I would say the best Disney movie since Aladdin. They really hit it out of the park with this one. It'a simple story, but the characters make it lots of fun to watch. Of course, the animation is incredible, both in how detailed and appealing, but also the style of design. I especially like the storybook settings like the Snuggly Duckling and the streets of the kingdom. The songs are fine, although I don't see the soundtrack as being one of the strong points. Rapunzel and Flynn are the main reason to watch, and supporting characters like Maximus and Mother Gothel add a lot as well. As a villain, Mother Gothel is one of the more complicated Disney characters; she's clearly evil, but at the same time, acts as a mother for Rapunzel. When the movie was over, I had some confusion about her motivations, which makes me wonder if younger viewers will be clear about her either.","

"TANGLED","Buddy-51","1 August 2011","The 50th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, ""Tangled"" is a little less flashy and a little less hectic than the average animated feature these days, hewing closer to ""reality"" than most such films – if one can stretch that term to include a tale of a beautiful, tower-dwelling princess whose blonde tresses glow when she sings, and whose ""Prince Charming"" comes in the form of a roguish thief whose face is plastered on wanted posters all over the countryside. But ""Tangled"" doesn't overplay its hand in the storytelling arena. There are no fire-breathing dragons, no talking animals, no over-extended action sequences (or at least no more than necessary). The focus is mainly on two attractive and likable characters coming to know and accept one another throughout the course of their adventures.The adventure begins when Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), who has just turned eighteen, decides she wants to leave the castle in which she's been locked away by an old crone posing as her mother - it turns out Rapunzel's hair confers eternal youth on anyone who touches it - in order to experience what life is like in the outside world. Rapunzel finally gets her wish when the thief, Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) - who's fleeing the law and the two cohorts he's just betrayed - attempts to hide in her tower, which he assumes is empty. However, he gets more than he bargained for when he meets this naïve but feisty young woman who sees him as the opportunity for escape she's been pining for all these years. So off they go to see the world, with many an unexpected adventure awaiting them along the way.""Tangled"" is a little more deliberately paced than the typical kids' flick – indeed it takes a full half-hour before we even get outside the tower room – and the scenes run a little longer than usual, as Rapunzel and Flynn take the time to establish a relationship of mutual respect and trust. The humor is gentle and the tone sweet, yet there is just the right amount of starch in the characters of the crone (nicely voiced by Donna Murphy) and Flynn's aggrieved criminal cohorts to keep things from getting too sappy. The soft-focus backgrounds provide an appropriately comfy setting for the tale, and the musical numbers (by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater) have an appealing Broadway show-tune brassiness to them that lifts the audience's spirits.As written by Dan Fogelman and directed by Nathan Greno and Byron Howard, ""Tangled"" doesn't come sailing out of the wings, as so many similar recent films have done, trying to impress us with its postmodern revisionism and cynical self-awareness. It tweaks some of the elements of the classic Fairy Tale genre to be sure, but it also acknowledges and respects those elements. It really isn't in the business of tearing things down just so it can congratulate itself on its own iconoclasm and irreverence. And I, for one, am tremendously grateful for that.","

"TANGLED","estebangonzalez10","31 January 2011","¨Superhuman good looks, I've always had them. Born with it. But superhuman strength, can you imagine the possibilities of this?¨ Tangled was a pleasant surprise and it reminded me a lot of the fairy tales I read during my childhood years. This is actually Disney's first CGI fairytale film and it was brought to us from the creators of Bolt and Meet the Robinsons (Nathan Greno and Byron Howard). The movie began a bit slow for my taste, but midway through it picked up and completely hooked me until the very end. There are several scenes which reminded me a lot of Disney's early movies such as Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and The Little Mermaid. The main characters aren't really the stars of the film; it's the secondary characters like Maximus- the horse, and Pascal- the chameleon who steal the show. They were the ones who got the most laughs out of the audience, but Rapunzel and Flynn did make a great couple and were very likable characters nonetheless. There are also a couple of scenes were a small man dressed only in diapers shows up drunk, and he is hilarious every few seconds he appears on screen. Disney took a huge risk at trying to go back to the classical fairytale stories, but it absolutely worked. The story was amazing and had several emotional moments along with very funny scenes that the entire family could enjoy. The CGI effects also gave the story a more magical feeling to it, and the lantern lighting scene was just breathtaking.As for the plot goes we are introduced to Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) who was born with magical healing and aging powers in her hair. The only problem is that if she cuts her hair those powers vanish (which explains why her hair is so long). She was born a princess, but due to her healing powers she was kidnapped by an old lady named Gothel (Donna Murphy), who locked her up in a tower so no one would ever find her. Gothel raises her as her child and Rapunzel grows up believing she is her daughter and thinking that the outside world is a dangerous place. Her only friend is a chameleon named Pascal with whom she spends the entire day locked up in her tower. One day a wanted man named Flynn (Zachary Levi) shows up accidentally in her tower while trying to hide from the castle guards who are searching for him because he has stolen the crown. Rapunzel knocks Flynn down with a frying pan and takes the crown from him. When Flynn wakes up Rapunzel realizes he is not as dangerous as her mother has told her men were, and she decides to make a deal with him. If he takes her to the castle to see the lantern lightings which are released every year on her birthday she will give him the crown back and let him go. Flynn realizes this will be a hard task since he is a wanted man, but it is his only opportunity so he takes it. Together they begin their journey, but the only problem is that everyone is after Flynn, including a guard's horse named Maximus, who is more committed to his mission on catching Flynn than anyone else.I actually watched this movie in Spanish (Rapunzel and Flynn were voiced by Chayanne and Danna Paola) and the translation was really well done as in all Disney films. The story is really well written and has several funny moments along with some emotional ones as well so Tangled is well balanced. The main reason I think this fairytale worked for both genres is that it doesn't only focus on the princess. This time the main characters are both Flynn and Rapunzel and they both get a lot of screen time. Flynn, despite being a thief, is a likable guy and has a good heart, while Rapunzel is the usual innocent girl who is being taken advantage of. As I mentioned before the secondary characters also are one of the main reasons why this film worked so well. Tangled is one of the best animated films of this year (after Toy Story 3 of course) and is well worth your time. I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did and didn't even like the trailer that much, but it really surprised me. I absolutely recommend this film for the entire family. The story is really well written and the dialogue in this film is hilarious.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/","

"TANGLED","purplegeekfreak","23 April 2016",". . . a horse? Disney's Tangled, directed by Nathan Greno and Bryon Howard, is charming, fun, and humorous, the perfect balance of marvelous music, appealing adventure, and ravishing romance. As the movie opens up, it starts with Mr. Dreamboat a.k.a. Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi), who narrates our tale and I must say, those ""Hot Guy"" focus groups Disney put together were a great idea. The focus group was a sudden gathering of all the women in the studio where they brought in pictures of the most attractive men they could find because Disney wanted Flynn to be the most handsome male lead that they have ever had and they succeeded. I mean, Flynn Rider is a hilarious hunk, especially for a bandit! This stunning thief tells the tale of the flower that came from the sun with its magical healing powers and about the old hag (Donna Murphy) who covets it before it's found and taken to the sickly queen, pregnant with Rapunzel (played with enlightening enthusiasm by Mandy Moore). After she is born, Mother Gothel snatches the princess out of her crib to lock her in a tower just so the horrid witch can use the rejuvenating powers Rapunzel's hair now holds. And that's all because once the hair is cut, it loses it's power and turns a nice shade of chestnut brown. This is where the magic really happens because the animation is so stunning! Her hair glows with the same brightness as the flower and with a snip, the glow delicately fades away. Not to mention the fact that Disney gives an actual explanation of why her hair is infinitely long because why should the only use for her hair be a rope?Years later, Rapunzel is singing about chores and crafts and when the heck is she going to be able to finally get out of the house, almost like a regular eighteen-year-old. But often singing. Moore blows us away with her brilliant vocals, singing ""When Will My Life Begin?"", for it's the day before Rapunzel's birthday and she has just one wish; to see the floating lights. We learn, later, these are actually lanterns sent out by the king and queen anticipating their daughter's return home. But Rapunzel's wish is declined by her ""mother"". Everyone saw that coming. What we didn't see coming, though, was after Mother Gothel cautions Rapunzel with a scintillating song ""Mother Knows Best"" and leaves the scene, the attractive criminal who comes along to scale the tower and hide for his life from the palace guards bringing the stolen crown with him. The stolen crown that just so happens to belong to Rapunzel! Here is where we find Disney putting it's own magical twist on this fairytale. Now we are seeing two main characters and Flynn Rider isn't even a prince like in the original Rapunzel story which is, really, kind of refreshing and it certainly holds my attention. Moreover, Flynn Rider is totally awesome for boys to connect with because he's sarcastic and humorous so while Rapunzel is singing about her feelings, Flynn Rider is cracking jokes everyone can enjoy. Disney certainly knows what it's doing. As the story continues, Rapunzel is frightened by this strange man in her prison like home so she uses her trusty frying pan to knock poor Flynn Rider out and stuff him in her closet until she can let Gothel know of her accomplishment. However, when Mother Gothel becomes infuriated with Rapunzel's constant plea to leave, Rapunzel decides to ask for paint as a birthday gift and begrudgingly brushes off the subject so Gothel leaves on a three-day journey for paint. With that, our golden-haired princess convinces Flynn Rider to be her guide to see the floating lanterns. In an attempt to scare Rapunzel back to her tower, Flynn takes her to ""The Snuggly Duckling,"" a pub filled with ruffians and thugs where they recognize Flynn Rider as the wanted thief and fight over him for the prize money. However, Rapunzel surprises everyone by standing up to these bullies and demands that they give her guide back, crying out to them that Flynn is the one she needs to take her to see the floating lanterns, her precious, lifelong dream which leads to another brilliant song involving all of the chummy ruffians who apparently have a soft spot for dreams and the friendly thugs help the lovable couple escape the royal army.Rapunzel and Flynn finally make it to safety. The adventure continues from there, including an exquisite last song, a hair-raising ending and in the company of Maximus, the stallion who acts more like a dog than an actual horse, provides comic relief and entertainment while interacting with Flynn Rider. Disney's Tangled is a lovely tear jerker and a captivating movie for boys, girls and horses of all ages. Another dazzling movie from Disney, as expected.","

"TANGLED","duncannoella","22 September 2023","I've been wanting to watch more Disney movies lately and I came across rapunzel and I know that I'm really late only watching it now but I was kind of suprised like I didn't expect it to be this good. I loved the story even though I kind of already knew what it was about it still got me engaged and it was gripping. I really loved the songs some I already knew but didn't know they were from this film so I was suprised. Loved particularly ""see the light"" it might be my favourite Disney song and the animation in that scene is so beautiful. Anyways, overall loved the film and I recommend it to everyone.","

"TANGLED","colinrgeorge","1 December 2010","This is what you get for not seeing ""The Princess and the Frog."" Disney eschewed its revitalization of traditional animation for this forgettable CG adaptation of Rapunzel, which goes by the nondescript nom de plume: ""Tangled.""If the recent announcement that the animation giant is placing a moratorium on fairy tale films should come as a surprise to anyone, their position on the matter is telegraphed plainly into the first five minutes of their latest and last: modern audiences won't sit for straight- faced fantasy. The name-change alone underscores the corporation's feelings on the commercial viability of a tradition it once held proud.That willful dissolution of magic is a slap in the face to ""Snow White"" or ""Sleeping Beauty."" ""Tangled"" begins with striking imagery, but buries it beneath a sour, smarmy voice over by this year's prince-not-so-charming, Flynn Ryder (Zachary Levi). As narrator, he cracks jokes at the expense of the archetypical framework—as if he doesn't, and we shouldn't, treat the story with one modicum of seriousness. Being cavalier about your own film isn't a great way to hook your viewers.Thus ""Tangled"" is a disengaging experience from the outset. It downplays its fairy tale roots, but then never defies them. It disinterests us in its world, and then asks us to spend ninety minutes there. Worse, it suffers from sloppy characterization, including one of the single weakest antagonists in Disney history. Donna Murphy plays Mother Gothel to Mandy Moore's Rapunzel, and neither has a lick of personality. The irksome Flynn is practically the only other human character, with the rest of the world being populated by nameless thugs and townspeople. When so much relies on so few, you'd think more attention would be paid to making them distinct.Essentially, Repunzel's sole remarkable trait is her magic hair, a plot device that is curiously ignored throughout the film. There are plenty of early gags visualizing how she manipulates it (for instance, in order to lift her mother into the tower), but it's clearly an afterthought as her adventure is set into motion. To illustrate, the princess emerges from a stream without any indication of the added water weight. She never once has her locks stepped on, snagged, or caught in a door. I thought this movie was called ""Tangled!"" Having hair that long would be a major inconvenience, people!Maybe I'm splitting hairs (ouch); I probably shouldn't have expected anything more from ""Tangled""—it's the near unanimous praise I don't understand. The songs are lousy, the characters are dull (save for one spunky chameleon), and the story merely suffices (but then it's tough to break something that's survived hundreds of years). The film is so clearly catered to a younger crowd that my curmudgeonly opinion is somewhat irrelevant, but with Pixar managing year after year to satisfy the storytelling needs of both adults and children, Disney's ""Tangled"" is an immediate relic. It's a film made for twelve year olds who need to be convinced that fairy tales aren't stupid and boring.""Enchanted"" and ""The Princess and the Frog"" were classic Disney films despite their flaws. Their creators clearly understood what made the studio in its prime so successful. ""Tangled"" is a harmless children's cartoon, but it doesn't recapture any of the magic the company is known for. Instead, it takes a snide approach to the Rapunzel story while simultaneously contributing nothing to it. I may not be the target audience, but to quote an old friend, ""If this is where the monarchy is headed, count me out.""","

"TANGLED","LloydBayer","1 October 2011","When German brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm started collecting folk tales around 1806, little did they know that 200 years later, their faces would be immortalized on a bank note of the highest denomination. Although the Deutsche Mark has been adopted into the Euro, the Grimm Brothers' (as they have been come to be known) story does not end there. From folklore to fairy tales to bedtime storybooks, their enchanting tales have continuously evolved until its present day rendition in cinema. And so we have ""Tangled"", a fluidly narrated, vividly colorful and stunningly animated version of Rapunzel, the original title from a compiled list of fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm. In this latest version, Nathan Greno and Byron Howard directs, while Dan Fogelman tweaks the screenplay without straying too far from the original tale. In a kingdom far away (no, not the same kingdom in ""Shrek"") the Queen is aided during childbirth by a rare flower with magical healing properties. Unbeknown to the King and Queen, an old woman has been keeping herself young and alive for centuries with this flower, but now finds that the healing and rejuvenating power of the flower has transferred to baby Rapunzel during childbirth. The old woman named Gothel then kidnaps Rapunzel and locks her up in a tall tower knowing that the little girl's golden hair holds the power to keep her from aging. Naïve to the outside world, Rapunzel grows up believing Gothel to be her mother but is fascinated by seeing thousands of floating lanterns once every year. Just before her eighteenth birthday, Rapunzel's life changes forever. Having stolen a royal tiara, a thief breaks into the tower but soon learns the hard way that Rapunzel is not a damsel in distress. Together, they escape the tower and head towards the kingdom, but not before having to deal with Gothel, her assassins and the King's royal guards. For a year that gave us quite a few animated features, Disney's ""Tangled"" came in third in terms of box-office performance. While ""Toy Story 3"" took the top spot, ""Shrek Forever After"" managed to secure a second place despite its overdone theatrics and lack of originality. For this reviewer, the real competition was between ""How to Train Your Dragon"", ""Despicable Me"" and ""Tangled"", all of which features an engaging and original story. While ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is cinematically epic, our film under discussion is superior in terms of production and visual brilliance. With a budget of $ 260 million, this is not only the most expensive animated film ever made, it is also the most time consuming, having been in production for six years. The staggering amount of time and money put into this project stems from the fact that Disney has invested in animating hand-drawn images and then injecting three-dimensional depth by employing over 50 CGI artists. The result speaks for itself- a gorgeously rendered animation with such detail, it has to be watched on a HD display to truly appreciate the skill that has gone into its making. What makes this film different is that it carries the High Definition clarity found in PIXAR animations, but with the added bonus of having the original art work traditionally hand painted. I were to guess, Disney has gone through such lengths to produce another animation, probably because this is their 50th title, an accolade in itself and a milestone in this company's 80 year history as a media conglomerate.Like most other Disney productions, the story here has a fare share of fantasy, romance and comedy. Even so, Disney ventures into unchartered waters with elements of sadness, some violence and a scene of drunkenness. Voiced by Donna Murphy, Fogelman's Gothel is not a witch but a woman with a dark heart who is capable of murder. Mandy Moore voices Rapunzel and along with Murphy, lends their voices for some of the film's soundtrack as well. Zachary Levi voices the thief called Flynn Rider, a character who is neither a Prince nor charming. Although Rider and Rapunzel's initial scenes together are met with slapstick comedy, the funniest characters for me are, a royal horse called Maximus and Rapunzel's pet chameleon, Pascal. On the other hand, soundtrack is not as catchy as Disney's famed animations like ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King"". Although nominated for an Academy Award for ""Best original Soundtrack"", this film lost the Oscar to Toy Story 3. Even so, Moore and Levi's duet with ""I see the Light"" is as visually stunning as it is pleasing to the ears.","

"TANGLED","Samiam3","27 March 2011","There's a kind of tenderness to behind Tangled that almost works on it's own with out the need for the so called 'post-modern' approach to fairy tales which brings out the cunning above the sentimentality. Tangled works either way. The film trusts it's material an its audience enough to embrace sentimentality, yet there is also a sense of modernity to the film which gives it that much of an edge. This is one of those a movie where the damsel in distress saves the dashing hero. It's cute as a romance, It's effective as part comedy, it feels organic as a musical (capturing Disney's better days). The ending feels a little cheap, but that's typical of fantasies, and I suppose there is no need to get picky. Tangled works, quite well.","

"TANGLED","lee_eisenberg","29 October 2015","Disney's 50th animated feature is an adaptation of the story of Rapunzel. I thought it neat that Maximus and Pascal put on a performance reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Usually this is the sort of movie that I would spend the whole time heckling like on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"", but I didn't heckle ""Tangled"". I guess that Rapunzel's assertive qualities made her more interesting than previous princesses, kind of like Elsa and Anna in ""Frozen"".And of course I can't resist noting the cast. I only loosely know about Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi. I understand that Donna Murphy is mainly a Broadway star. The rest of the cast catches my attention: Brad Garrett (Everybody Loves Raymond), Ron Perlman (Hellboy), Jeffrey Tambor (Arrested Development) and Richard Kiel (a 7-foot actor best known for a role in the James Bond franchise).So, it's an OK, enjoyable movie. Not any sort of masterpiece. I will say that Rapunzel herself is a hottie.","

"TANGLED","ranblackman","10 April 2019","That's really the best way to describe this movie. With Disney, you usually get movies that can be described this way. Their films, mostly their animated films, have a good streak of fun, cute, funny, and adventure titles that usually feature great theatrical music, and some rather impressive animation to boot.Most all of this can be said for Tangled, as well as it's an admittedly predictable plot. Yes, we have them all is lost moments and a typical story of someone wanting more out of life. Where this film successes in the chemistry between the two leads. Rapunzel and Flynn are really good together. They bring in plenty of laughs and even some rather touching moments in the end. It is all simple, but there is something in that chemistry for everyone.That's what I liked about it, even more, there is not too much childishness. It all evens out, and I did have a good time with it and would say to give it a watch if you haven't yet.","

"TANGLED","Juja1","20 December 2010","This movie felt like a 9 on the entertainment scale. The movie drew me in and made me laugh many times. First Disney movie I liked since years. The 1 point missing to a full ten goes off for the plot holes (...why is it now necessary to sing in order to activate the flower/hair magic, and then again it isn't? ...how did the horse get the bunch of thieves to follow him, plus place them behind open prison doors? ...why wasn't the princess at least a little sad for her stepmother whom she had loved for so many years?...). I liked the loving attention to detail such as in the art-nouveau style wall paintings and the pub scene. While I love the old hand-drawn Disney Classics such as Djungle Book and Aristocats with wonderful swing music, I could never really connect to any Disney movie since then - did not like the over-polished gaudy-coloured look of Aladdin & Co. and the pop-style songs; found Princess & the frog a bit boring, too full of cliché visual references to old-style Disney which did not work in my opinion, and was put off by the unnatural purple colour in the voodoo scenes. Tangled on the other hand seems to look more forward than back, and at the same I thought this feels more like one of the old movies. Some scenes felt almost like a movie scene with real actors, such as the one in the cave. A turn towards realism goes well with me. As another reviewer remarked there were still other scenes of unlikely physics (surviving a huge fall) which made me stumble a bit, but which I did not mind too much. Rapunzel's big-eyed pink barbie look...well...thank god she acted differently. As for the lantern scene...it was beautifully made though maybe just a bit too much, think I heard some viewers disconnecting due to the sentimental overdose and getting a little impatient, at least when having a 3D lantern shoved into our faces :-)...I got this random thought about masses of waste lanterns littering the woods on the next morning, and then all the time I had to think about this poor guy who according to the newspapers is fighting paper lanterns, because one of them came down on their house and killed his son in the resulting fire. He will probably not enjoy the movie as much as I did.","

"TANGLED","The_Film_Cricket","4 April 2011","Going back to my childhood, hearing the story of Rapunzel, there was a nagging issue that always bothered me. Follow me on this: Here is the story of a maiden with extremely long hair who was held captive in the tall tower waiting for her prince to come and rescue her. When he arrives, he implores her ""Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let down your hair!"", to which she drops her hair down to ground level so he can climb it like a rope. Here's my issue: He's a grown man, climbing her hair like a rope . . . that is attached to her head! How is her hair not being pulled out by the roots? That's a question, I'm afraid that no one seems to be able to properly answer, neither in the 199 year-old tale told first written by The Brother's Grimm nor in Disney's lively new computer-animated version which turns Rapunzel's over-developed locks into a tool of 1001 uses. Seriously, she hangs from it, makes a jump rope with it, and even ties the intruding prince to a chair with it. I guess the easy answer is: her hair is magic, lay off! Here it is explained that her blond locks have the power to heal when she sings a certain song. What happens if she gets the words wrong? The story in this version tells us that when Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) was a baby, her hair was accidentally enchanted by an old crone called Mother Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy) who had discovered a spell for retaining her youth and beauty. In order to keep the enchantment safe, she kidnapped the child, pretended to be her mother and locked her in a tall tower and forbade her to step outside. As Rapunzel grew up, she wondered, naturally, what was out there. As she grows, so does her hair. If she cuts it, her hair turns brown and the spell dies. Got it? Good! Her salvation is not a regal prince but a thieving goof named Flynn Rider (voiced by Zachary Levi of TV's ""Chuck""). Flynn is not his real name, I'll leave that for you to discover. Anyway, he has stolen some crown jewels and is on the run from some of the palace guards. He finds himself stashing away in Rapunzel's tower until the heat's off - that's how he comes to find himself tied to a chair by her long hair. Naturally the story will involve the pair falling in love and doing battle with Mother Gothel for the enchantment that lies within those golden tresses.The story is a bit standard. The love story, the magic spell, the villain, the music. They are all lifted from a hundred other Disney musicals. I think the screenwriters knew that because they were smart enough to give the movie a wicked sense of humor. All of the characters have bold personalities, whip-smart dialogue and wonderfully expressive faces. This is a fun movie just to listen to. In tone, the movie has the kind of wise-cracky freshness and sense of humor that made Shrek so special (and that its sequels never quite achieved).The film also benefits from the presence of two wonderful supporting characters. One is a chameleon who is Rapunzel's only companion. His face is very expressive and so is his ever-shifting skin color the functions like a mood ring. The other is a very clever horse, part of the king's guard. He is ever-efficient and ever-determined to hunt down Flynn and bring him to justice. This is some horse, not only is he a beast of burden but he's also part bloodhound and, at one point, a pretty good swordsman. The fact that these two characters never speak allows their body language to speak for them. They are more expressive that way.'Tangled' is part of the new 3D revolution. The palette is made of vibrant with colors that are clean and polished. The characters almost resemble Barbie Dolls. That may be the film's only real flaw, it is too clean. There's nothing in the artistry to make it distinctive or to further the art of animation or to try new things. Immediately after I saw Tangled, I saw the wonderful Irish animated feature The Secret of Kells - this happened purely by coincidence. That film had a texture and a form of the illustrations one might find in a children's story book. The characters were angular, squared and pointed in a way that matched their personalities (Think of the form of ""Samurai Jack"" and you get the idea""). Here the characters and the landscapes all look manufactured. We don't feel we're looking at a special place, just a manufactured background. Still, with that limitation, I had a good time. I laugh a lot, the characters intrigued me and I walked away with the image of a man with a frying pan dueling a horse with a sword. Where else are you going to see that?","

"TANGLED","Tweekums","26 December 2012","As this story opens leading man, Flynn Rider, tells us how a sunbeam once fell to Earth and became a magical golden flower. This flower was kept by Gothal, an old woman, who used its magic to stay forever young and refuses to share its power. One day, when the pregnant queen is on the verge of death the palace guard search the kingdom and find the flower; they turn it into a medicine that saves the queen. The magic remains though; this time locked within the newborn Princess Rapunzel's hair. Gothal sneaks into the palace to steal a lock of the child's hair but as soon as she cuts it, it turns brown and loses its magic so she takes the baby. The years pass and Gothal raises Rapunzel as her own child; keeping her locked in a tall tower to 'protect' her from the dangers of the world. Rapunzel begs her mother to let her leave the tower to see the lanterns being released on her birthday but the request is refused. As luck would have it Flynn ends up in Rapunzel's tower after fleeing from the royal guard he has just stolen a priceless tiara from the palace! Rapunzel talks him into taking her to see the lanterns and along the way she learns the truth about her 'mother' and the two of them have the expected series of adventures before things appear to go wrong again.This Disney 3D animation may not have been made in collaboration with Pixar but it has a charm of its own and a distinct 'Disney' look and more importantly sound; the characters sing a succession of songs throughout the film. The story is enjoyably with plenty of action, a good number of laughs, enough scares and even an apparent tragedy that may cause a few tears to be shed if you think a Disney film could let a protagonist die. The film's PG certificate is due to the mild violence; this is mostly comical though and frequently involves frying pans so it should be okay for most children to watch unless you are worried they will copy the protagonists and batter each other with frying pans! The animation looks really good; the characters move and show emotion in a genuinely human way even though they are clearly cartoon characters rather than realistically proportioned. I'd certainly recommend this to fans of Disney animation; it may not be classic hand drawn animation but it is still classic Disney.","

The animation is bright, vivid, and lively, the voice work is good, and the songs are passable, if not great. There's just not a lot to complain about, here.

""Flynn"" looks a lot like a young Errol Flynn. ""Rapunzel"" looks like a Barbie doll, right down to her cute button nose.

John Lassiter has truly saved Walt Disney Pictures. Unlike ""Brave"", my family wants to see this movie again and again. Wagner cast iron frying pans are the new medieval secret weapon! Look for Pinocchio ""hidden"" in the rafters of the ""Snugly Duckling"" Pub! Excessive comic violence, hints of execution, a brief death-scene (magically reversed), plus a ""Barbie Doll"" figure on a teenager make this a ""9"" instead of a ""10"".

"TANGLED","Hellmant","7 January 2011","'TANGLED': Three Stars (Out of Five) Disney's 50th animated feature! They spared no expense too, at a whopping $260 million budget it's the second most expensive film in history. The film is a throwback to the great Disney animated films we saw in the 80's and 90's as opposed to the more recent (but it's still a far cry from the classics of the 30's, 40's and 50's). It's a fantasy film based on an old fairy tale again (another from the Brothers Grimm) with plenty of musical numbers. Something kids are sure to love but it may lack the interest of older viewers.Revamped retelling of the Grimms Fairy Tale 'Rapunzel'. It tells the story of a magical flower that has the power to heal the sick and wounded. It also has the power to keep an old witch named Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy) young if she sings to it. The Queen of a nearby village becomes ill and having heard of the flower sends her guards to retrieve it to cure her. They do and the Queen is saved. Shortly later she gives birth to a daughter, Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) and Gothel knows that the powers of the flower still exists in the child's hair as long as it isn't cut. So the witch kidnaps Rapunzel and locks her away in a hidden tower raising her as her own. She forbids Rapunzel from leaving the tower, telling her it's for her safety, and never cuts her hair. 18 years later Rapunzel longs for the outside world and truly dreams of traveling to the mysterious lights she sees every year on her birthday. When a thief (voiced by Zachary Levi, of TV's 'CHUCK' fame) stumbles upon her tower while trying to elude authorities she knocks him out and steals his loot. She then makes a deal with him that she'll give him back his valuables if he agrees to escort her to the magical lights. An adventure begins and of course the two fall in love.The movie is predictable and clichéd but it is somewhat fun and amusing as well. The animation is colorful and beautiful and the jokes are somewhat funny. I didn't find the music to be very well written though and when it gets to be one musical number after another the film starts to drag and for me becomes really uninteresting. The film is clever and visually impressive to a certain extent but I didn't find it to be nearly as entertaining as a lot of the glowing reviews it's been getting (like Quentin Tarantino's 5th place 2010 top 20 placing). It is better than a lot of the more recent Disney animated films though and as a kids film it definitely works. Overall it's a decent animated kids film but certainly not a great one.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYbw_OZUFso","

Since most Disney animated features are based on fairy tales, you can pretty well count on a happy ending. Super CGI places Rapunzel in the company of timeless classics like SNOW WHITE and SLEEPING BEAUTY. Disney never disappoints.Other voices you may recognize: Brad Garrett, Jeffrey Tambor and Ron Perlman.","

"TANGLED","saadgkhan","3 April 2011","TANGLED – CATCH IT ( A ) Tangled is undoubtedly the most charming movie by Disney. It brings the fantastical story of Rapunzel into live again. It's surprising to see that decades have passed by still Disney manages to bring it's beloved stories in totally new enchanting look, which makes them seems like totally new. Tangled is magical blend of humor, music, love and horror. On one side makers have wonderfully achieved bring the magical hairs of Rapunzel into life and on the other side the ending of Tangled is heart wrenching and one of the most daring in Disney movies. Kudos to Disney for having wonderful breathtaking animation and for having Mandy Moore's voice as Rapunzel. Mandy Moore's bring a lot of character to Rapunzel; it was so fascinating to see how she plays with her voice in scenes. Though, on screen we are watching an animation but her voice makes it as believable as any living human. Zachary Levi also did a good job as the thief/hero of Rapunzel. The scenes between him and maximum the White Horse are hilarious. Overall, Tangled is one of the most fascinating and charming animated movie, which takes you into a magical fantastical world.","

This isn't only about a princess and a thief falling in love, but it is also about following your dreams but respecting your elders as well. Mother Gothel, even though she was a villain, had me laughing. It shows, to other mothers, not Mother Gothel in particular, how much mothers can care for their children. They want to protect them. Especially mothers and fathers. Even though Mother Gothel only loved Rapunzel for her magical, long hair, other mothers probably don't. The songs were touching and fun and exciting, and everything about Tangled was a magical expierence for me.","

"TANGLED","rebeccalucy","10 December 2017","Tangled is a beautifully animated film, the lantern scene being absolutely stunning. It can also be used to create fast paced comedy and action. Flynn Rider is one of the best Disney princes, as he has a fun personality that develops throughout the film. The animation allows for some fun expressions between him and Rapunzel, unlike past ones.I think the story is very thought out, giving reasons for Rapunzel to grow out her hair and why Mother Gothel wants her in the first place. It could have been really easy to phone in the plot, but a lot of time went into it. Furthermore, Maximus as the comedic relief is great. He doesn't need to talk to be funny, they allow him to have unique expressions. However, the songs are quite good but don't always further the story. Sometimes they can be a little distracting or take away from the plot. The villain is quite threatening but sometimes needs to be developed a little bit more. In conclusion, a great Disney film with beautiful animation. But could use a little tweaking to make it fantastic!","

I have not been impressed with the past few...But I was very wrong!I watched it with my best friend and we laughed the whole time. Each character had personality and was unique. The story line was interesting and it held our attention throughout the movie. When it was over, I wished there was more to watch. Plus, the voices of the characters fit perfectly! And the soundtrack is excellent. This is a Disney movie that will forever be a favorite of mine. One day, when I have kids, this will be their version of my Cinderella. It is a movie that I am sure any age will love. I am so excited to fall in love with a Disney movie again and hopefully, their will be a Tangled 2!","

I am a high school student, and when I was told we would be watching this movie in class, I was not very enthusiastic, being a guy. After watching part of the movie, I actually came home and finished the rest. A couple of my classmates, also males, admitted they did the same and loved the movie as well. This movie is for any age group, and whether the viewer is a 3 year old girl or a 16 year old boy, they will love it. This is the first movie that has touched me in a long time. It is humorous, action-packed, emotional, and original. The CGI is so realistic and perfect, everything is exactly how one would picture the events as they happen in real life. The characters are witty and funny, all with their own contributions that make the story so great. I cannot describe why, but this movie deeply impacted me. I find clips of the movie popping into my head at random moments, and I think about it repeatedly throughout the day. I have watched it over and over again, never getting tired of it. I really hope that they decide to make a sequel, because this is one of the best movies I have seen, and my peers all agree. I do hope Disney disregards it's tradition of not making sequels for this one, because this was an amazing movie with an incredible, touching story that could have a great continuation.","

"TANGLED","JamesHitchcock","3 January 2013","Several of the early Disney feature-length cartoons (""Snow White"", ""Cinderella"", ""Sleeping Beauty"") were based upon European fairy tale, and with ""Tangled"" the Walt Disney Animation Studios returns to this source of inspiration. Their previous animated feature ""The Princess and the Frog"" had also been very loosely based on a Brothers Grimm folk tale, but in that case the action had been transferred from Europe to twentieth-century America. ""Tangled"" is likewise only loosely based upon the original tale, but at least it keeps the traditional European setting. The film was originally titled ""Rapunzel"", after the fairy tale on which it is based, but this was changed to ""Tangled"" shortly before its release. The change, which caused some controversy, was apparently motivated by the studio's concern that their recent animated features, with their stress on the ""Disney Princesses"", had only appealed to girls, and their belief that by shifting the emphasis in the title away from the leading female character they could make the film more attractive to boys. (In a similar fashion Disney's current animation project, based upon Anderson's ""The Snow Queen"" and to be released later this year, has been renamed ""Frozen""). Despite the change of title, the film still keeps the heroine's odd- sounding name (not a normal Christian name even in German and one which I could never pronounce as a child). In this version Rapunzel lives in a secluded tower with a woman named Gothel whom she believes to be her mother. In fact, Rapunzel is the daughter of the king and queen of a nearby kingdom, and Gothel has kidnapped her in order to exploit Rapunzel's ultra-long hair which has magical properties. Gothel has forbidden her supposed ""daughter"" to leave the tower in which she lives, but Rapunzel yearns to explore the wider world which she has never seen, and manages to escape with the help of a young man. I have often thought that the changing appearance of the Disney Princesses sheds an interesting light upon changing attitudes to female beauty. Snow White from the thirties, although she is supposed to be an adult woman, always looks disturbingly adolescent. Cinderella and Aurora from the fifties are both cool blondes, the first with something of the looks of Grace Kelly, the second resembling a blonde Audrey Hepburn. There were to be no princesses in the sixties and seventies, a period when the studio's cartoons were mostly about animals rather than humans, but Ariel from the eighties reverts to the innocent child-woman look popularised by some of the models and actresses of the era, such as Samantha Fox. The princesses of the nineties, the decade of the supermodel, are much more curvaceous and adult-looking, such as Pocahontas and Jasmine in ""Aladdin"". Tiana from ""The Princess and the Frog"", the first black Princess, made her appearance in the year that America's first black President took office. Rapunzel again has something of the adolescent about her, resembling a young Sarah Michelle Gellar, but then she is supposed to be only eighteen. She is, however, something of a feisty, feminist princess, the sort of girl who prefers to take the initiative rather than sit around in the hope of being rescued by a prince. In the Grimm story, Rapunzel is indeed rescued by a prince, but here her love-interest is a handsome young commoner named Flynn Rider. Far from being royal, Flynn- presumably named after Errol- is something of a rogue; when we first meet him he is on the run after stealing the tiara of the ""lost princess"", as Rapunzel has become known after her disappearance. Of course, he later becomes a reformed character; indeed, the human capacity to reform oneself and become something new is a recurrent theme in the film. Rapunzel succeeds in rediscovering her true identity, rejecting the false one which has been forced on her by Gothel, and a gang of scary-looking thugs all turn out to be rather gentler than their appearance might suggest. They also have some surprising ambitions, which Rapunzel encourages them to pursue. Disney villainesses are generally portrayed either as ugly (Cinderella's stepsisters) or as scary-looking (the Wicked Queen in ""Snow White"" or the Wicked Fairy in ""Sleeping Beauty""), but Gothel, a pretty thirty- something, is much more normal-looking, although her brunette colouring and sharper features indicate that, contrary to what she might claim, there is no blood relationship between her and the blonde, sweet-faced Rapunzel. Gothel, in fact, despite her villainy, is generally presented as a comic figure, a neurotically and ludicrously over-protective mother, rather than a figure of pure evil. (Gothel also gets to sing the film's most memorable song, ""Mother Knows Best"").The other character that stands out is Maximus, the horse belonging to the captain of the Royal Guards and an enthusiastic pursuer of evildoers, an animal counterpart to the heroes of all those ""tough cop"" movies. Like most Disney Princesses, Rapunzel has her own animal companion, a pet chameleon named Pascal. My personal preference has always been for the traditional hand-drawn style of animation rather than the computer generated version. ""Tangled"", however, is one of the more visually attractive examples of the latter style, often with a look reminiscent of a painting; apparently the eighteenth-century French artist Jean-Honoré Fragonard was a major influence on the animators. I am not going to award this film a mark out of ten, as children's films need to be judged by different criteria to films for adults, preferably by the children themselves. I can, however, say that ""Tangled"" is a very enjoyable piece of family entertainment, with plenty of excitement and amusement for all.","

"TANGLED","changmoh","21 November 2010","With or without 3-D, ""Tangled"" looks set to overtake last year's under-achieving ""The Princess and the Frog"" at the box-office. What's more, its non-verbal horse named Maximus is bound to give Shrek's talkative Donkey a run for the money! The tale of Rapunzel (voice of Mandy Moore) gets a revisionist twist here and she is 'rescued' not by a handsome prince on a white horse but a young, egoistic bandit (Zachary Levi as Flynn Rider) and a horse (named Maximus) that thinks it is a dog. The villain is Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy), the narcissistic witch who imprisons our princess in a secluded tower.Like ""Beauty & The Beast"" and ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Rapunzel"" also comes with musical and dance numbers. Except for 'Mother Knows Best', most of them have yet to catch on with the public. They may not be as catchy as those of Little Mermaid but given time, some may actually work their magic.What I like best are the solid Disney characterisations, especially of its animals. Mandy Moore's Rapunzel suitably represents Every Girl who is forced to stay home; Flynn plays the Bad Boy-type who sorely needs to be tamed and corrected by the proverbial Love; and the manipulative Mother Gothel aptly reflects the way some kids view their over-protective parent.The show-stealers are the mandatory animal sidekicks - a chameleon named Pascal and the palace horse Maximus. These are not just supporting characters but they have actual 'acting' duties as well. And the fact that they do not speak, helps to boost realism and makes them even funnier. Of course, the action is popcorn stuff but the social themes it explores make for worthy parental contemplation. A fitting film for everyone to let down their hair. - By LIM CHANG MOH (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)",NA
"TANGLED","Sweetigal85","25 June 2017","This movie is simply the greatest version of Rapunzel that has ever been told. As a kid, this was always one of my least favorite stories. It was definitely lacking structure and depth, but Disney imbued their magic into its pages and made it a dazzling work of art.Rapunzel is a fabulous very first CGI princess and Mandy Moore was an amazing choice, both for her delightfully sweet speaking/singing voice and her general whimsicality. Mandy Moore has now ascended to stardom as one of the legendary Disney Princesses.From start to finish, it is a feast for the eyes and envelops you completely in the magical story. Rapunzel is the very first Disney princess to possess any kind of magic!!! Yes, magic has been clearly present in every other princess movie, but think about it...none of the princesses ever wielded any form of magic themselves until now. So that makes this movie groundbreaking just for that alone.In the original, the male love interest was the prince, so I am glad they jazzed this version up and made him a lovable thief instead. Flynn is an amazing character and he and Rapunzel have one of the greatest meet cutes of all time. It is very Shakespearean that the audience knows that Gothel is NOT Rapunzel's mother and that she does NOT possess this knowledge as we do. We also know that she is the lost princess and that Gothel is stalking her with the Stabbington brothers who are stalking Flynn for revenge. Very poetic and well done.Every single song was gold. They were catchy and whimsical and the lyrics were apt and beautiful. The animal companions which are usually my least favorite part of every Disney movie were actually terrific in this film. It makes sense that Rapunzel would have flocked to some sort of creature in her lonely tower so Pascal's presence is believable and not just crowbarred in like many others. The horse Maximus is absolutely hilarious and actually serves the plot tremendously.The redeemable villains were very well done, particularly Flynn's. His backstory as Eugene Fitzherbert is extremely touching as well as his transformation from common thief to Rapunzel's lover.What is refreshingly different about Flynn and Rapunzel's romance is that they did not have a typical love at first sight reaction like most Disney couples do. True, they were definitely both attracted to each other right away, but love blossomed between them as their epic journey commenced. To me, this makes it all the more meaningful.The ending was unexpectedly dark and I wish Disney dared to go down paths like this more often. There is always that classic moment in every Disney movie were you are legitimately terrified that the character in peril is really going to die (Whereas in Lion King, they actually DO)It is so beautiful that Rapunzel was actually going to sacrifice the rest of her life to being Gothel's fountain of youth, just to save the man she loved. And Flynn reciprocated this beauty by not allowing her to snuff out her light to restore his. When he says ""But if you do this, you will die."" He surely meant that if she goes through with being Gothel's slave for all eternity, she will cease to be the wonderful soul that she is now. Such torturous treatment would drain her and cause the light in her eyes to wither and die, even if she persisted to live because of the magical flower. So that is why Flynn frees her from her curse and chops of all her precious hair, even though that means sacrificing himself. People argue that he could have let her heal him and THEN chopped off her hair, but he refused to use her for her power just like Gothel and the rest of the world would have wanted to. The rhyme that activates the flower is beautiful and when Rapunzel cries onto Flynn's face, I personally believe that this is the very last of her healing powers leaking out of her now that the power of the golden flower has been severed. Their kiss is beautiful, I absolutely love how Rapunzel seizes the lapels of his shirt and yanks him toward her. The look of delighted surprise on his face when she does this is so adorable. I really love how powerful and forceful Disney princesses have become. And then later on in the end, she dips him instead of him dipping her. I love it! Gothel's demise is poetically and brilliantly executed and it goes to show how sweet Rapunzel is that she still reaches out helplessly toward the despicable woman she loved and knew to be her mother.My absolute favorite part of the whole movie is when Rapunzel's parents see her again and the mother just knows it is her by looking in her eyes and touching her face. I thought it was really beautiful and interesting that they chose to not have the parents speak at all, they displayed all of their emotions through facial expressions and gestures. My favorite moment is when Rapunzel and her parents drop to the floor in their ecstatic embrace and the queen reaches out her hand to Eugene. He goes to bow to her but she seizes his hand and pulls him into their embrace and thus welcomes him without question into their family because he is the man who returned Rapunzel to them and who loves their daughter. So beautiful! I really stand by that this is one of the greatest movies ever made. It has something for everyone. Love, adventure, betrayal, humor, heart-warming songs. This is definitely one of the funniest Disney movies of all time. The humor between them is very carefully scripted and honestly I think better suits an older crowd. But kids can still appreciate the slapstick with the frying pan haha.LOVE LOVE LOVED IT!!!",NA
"TANGLED","fritzlang","27 November 2010","Just got back from a 3D showing of Tangled with 2 10 year old girls.The movie was GREAT! One of the more enjoyable kids films I have seen - it REALLY works for adults as much as kids..and not just girls either.The animation was top notch and VERY effective use of 3D. Much better than Toy Story. The 3D definitely enhanced the film, and there were some scenes that we actually reached out our hands to try to grab something! A first for us! The story seemed a little 'meatier' and mature than some of the other Disney films, while retaining the formula 'spunky girl goes after her dream and nobody is going to stop her.' I really don't want to talk about the plot because I thought it was very well laid out, with a TERRIFIC villainess, and a smart alec -tho-you'll-learn-to-love-him guy and a really likable girl. But it s a very clever take on the Rapunzel story.I was never bored.. I laughed (the humor is REALLY good - so slapstick, but some refreshingly subtle humor too). and yes, I cried (won't tell you why).This may be the most enjoyable Disney film I have seen in a LONG time.There were only 2 things I wished they did differently.1) The songs. They were 'okay' and served the film well, but nothing really stood out. I left the theater and couldn't remember one song. Nothing like ""under the sea"" or ""circle of life"" from the earlier films that stay with you after the credits have long gone by.2) speaking of credits, these were the lamest closing credits I think I have ever seen in a big budget film. There was nothing to keep our interest (and the closing credits were LONG).. No animation.. no clips.. no outtakes.. no surprise scene at the end, etc. Just text scroll. Of course, most people don't include closing credits in their review, but I have seen so many clever credits (remember Lemony Snicket's closing credits?) that after such a cleverly done film, just seeing plain text scroll for 5 minutes was disappointing.. Of course, we were the only ones left in the theater watching the credits so this may mean nothing to most people...Highly recommended for the entire family.9 out of 10.",NA

"TANGLED","johnstonjames","20 March 2011","wow. i really thought this was a lot of fun. it was also pure Disney. the CGI animated films released directly by Disney (Meet The Robinsons, Chicken Little),often feel more like authentic Disney than the Pixar/Disney collaborations.not that the Pixar films aren't the best in the field of CGI animation, and do utilize a totally Disney approach, but there is always a underlying element of collaboration that often feels as much Pixar as Disney. unlike Buena Vista distribution which was established by Disney himself in the 1950's after he left RKO, Pixar was a independent production facility that originally had nothing to do with Disney.i also happen to feel that fairy tales are often what Disney does best. i love fairy tales. so i guess this had more appeal to me and felt more like the Disney classics i grew up with. the animation in Pixar/Disney films is more elaborate and accomplished, but this had more of the ""Disney"" heart to it. 'Finding Nemo' and 'Cars' were excellent films and had better, more proficient animation, but in some ways i enjoyed this film even more.'Tangled' is also a little more psychologically deeper than the usual Pixar films. 'Tangled' might very well be Disney's most psychologically complex film next to their film 'Enchanted'. i've always felt that 'Enchanted' has some of the most complicated and revealing psychology of any Disney film including Disney's golden age of classics. 'Enchanted' kind of works as couch therapy for Disney fans brought up on fairly simplistic, straight forward happy ending philosophies. 'Tangled' might not be as philosophical about the whole fairy tale happy ending thing, but the psychology of the witch/step mother, is pretty intense. the step mother tries to control the girl with fear and manipulation. something our current society often thrives on.i'm not saying that every time a adult enforces authority on a child is unjustified, but this certainly gives the viewer something to think about. the only problem here is that it does sort of make ""alternative"" parenting look bad.still, there are little or no flaws here. it's pretty much perfect and perfectly delectable family fare. teen age girls especially will probably eat it up and hang on every word. don't see why not. even though 'Tangled' is for all audience members, it's primary appeal will be mostly for teen age girls and young women.if you are a true Disney fan, and one that loves the ""princess"" fairy tale movies like i do, you'll get a real kick out of this winner. i suggest that even if you are not a die hard Disney fan, you let your hair down, sit back, and just dig this sugary, Disney treat.",NA
"TANGLED","rosiethorns88","11 November 2010","I was part of a select, lucky crowd attending an early screening of this film at the 2010 Red Stick Animation Festival, where we were treated with the presence of one of Tangeled's animation supervisors, Clay Kaytis.It was exciting to hear from Kaytis about the film's production such as how Rapunzel's hair had to be customarily animated depending on the scene - some by bone systems and dynamics, others by painstakingly hand animating her long golden locks. What was most thrilling, was to find out that Glen Keane (a legend among modern Disney Animators) would check the 3D animation on Rapunzel and hand draw over her movements as 2D traditional animation where it was necessary to show her 3D animators how to ""make her movements beautiful"" - and it truly shows!The film's story and characters are also at the same level as its visuals. The premise is great; the short story of the classic tale was fleshed out in an entertaining adventure that can easily stand on its own. The characters are distinct and carry great chemistry - especially between the two leads.The film's songs are the only things that fall short of the full mark. While they are very tolerable and help carry the storytelling, nothing memorable stands out after the first viewing (with the exception of the Mother Knows Best Reprise - Donna Murphy shines with this one). However, they may require several viewings before I'm completely hooked on them (I'm looking at you, Princess and the Frog) Tangled is the film that definitely deserves the spot as Walt Disney's 50th Animated Film. Strong plot, lovable characters and lusciously stunning animation - it's a perfect storm of the Walt Disney magic we've been holding our breath for.",NA

"TANGLED","aharmas","11 December 2010","When ""The Princess and The Frog"" came out, we rejoiced because old fashioned animation, a strong storyline, a different yet strong heroine, and some very funny moments had all worked well to give us a new classic. It was indeed a very good movie, with marvelous music numbers and gorgeous animation.This year, the animation, with the help of more sophisticated computers, has achieved new heights, creating a softer, more natural look, to resemble old fashioned artwork. The problem is that the other elements are not up to the technical standards. We have rather bland vocal entries in most of the leading performances, and both the music and the storyline could have been much better.As it is the case in most of the films we see nowadays there is strong emphasis on coming up with ""potentially good ideas"", yet their development somehow comes short. Here our heroine's dreams, which we sympathize with, draw us into her world, and we can't help but admire the simple but strong young woman who tries to break herself free from the only world she knows. To get there, she is assisted by a dashing young man, who must learn to grow up as well.While as the heroines of recent animated stories, all have assertive and independent personalities, mostly based on their embracing knowledge through books (""Beauty and The Beast""), poor bravado and curiosity (""The Little Mermaid""), or the aspiring chef of ""The Princess and The Frog"". Those characters mesmerized us, with the help of clever, intelligent lyrics, and hummable melodies. ""Tangled"" can't compete in either department, as the very simplistic, underdeveloped characters are poorly served by the pedestrian lyrics.There are a couple of magic moments in the film, but even those feel forced, as part of a design, not of a fully realized work. Nothing here can match the anxiety and sadness of the furnace scene in ""Toy Story"", the wonder of the birth of love in ""Beauty and The Beast"" or witnessing mortality in ""Up"". Animation has grown so much recently; it's hard to feel satisfied by efforts like this film.",NA

When the evil stepmother breaks into song too, (what she actually is, I won't spoil it for those who may not have seen it yet), needless to say didn't help matters much.Things recover a little bit after we are introduced to the gentleman thief. Though, he is nowhere as rogue as I would like (this is after all Disney), I liked this character enough to keep watching. When the lost princess shows a little spunk as well, that's when my interest really kicked in.Now for the best part: Can you believe that it is a song? I couldn't believe it either. It's corny, predictable but handled in such a way that I was surprised I was laughing so much during it. Tough guys with soft hearts have been covered since the silent film days, but whatever. Just look at the scene and you will laugh your head off.The conclusion is again a little predictable and it made me a little sad that the second act didn't sustain itself into the third.

So here it goesTangled, the movie that kicked off the Disney Revival Era and ended the period of Dark Age for Disney, is also one of their best creations to date that easily holds up to the magic of the Disney Renaissance. This movie is the pinnacle of Disney's Modern Day Fairytales and features loveable characters, catchy music, a menacing villain and one of the best romance stories in Disney History.The story is kinda similar to the previous Disney Princess movies but the smart writing makes the story and the world its own while still keeping the magic of Disney's previous Princess movies though some aspects of it can feel a little cliche at times but it's not that big of a problem. Rapunzel is easily one of the most likable, charming and hilarious Disney protagonist. She has this warm energy that makes you fall in love with the character the moment she appears on screen. Flynn Rider aka Eugene Fitzherbert was one of the best parts of the movie. He's funny and cunning but has a soft side which he let's out after he meets Rapunzel. He practically carries the whole film with his perfect comedic timings. Mother Gothel is a great Disney villain. She has all the qualities of the previous Disney villains. She's manipulative, cunning, wicked and a little bit of sassy. Her solo number Mother Knows Best shows how manipulative she is to Rapunzel feeding her with all the lies about the human world. Maximus is great. He's expressions and chemistry with Flynn Rider is really hilarious to watch. Pascal was just there. The romance between Rapunzel and Flynn is electric. You really buy their love for each other and I like how this isn't a love at first sight kind of a situation. Their bond grows more and more with each conversation and crazy adventures.The animation is beautiful as always. The movie has a warm and storybook feel to it, from Rapunzel's Tower to the environments, which really makes it stands out from a lot of Disney movies from the same time period. Though it is not as detailed as some of the more recent Disney Princess movies but that's not really a problem when you've got a whole cast of such expressive and entertaining characters.The music by Alan Menken is good however some songs aren't memorable. I See The Light is the standout. The vocals, the visuals, the lyrics they all sell it perfectly. When Will My Life Begin is a lively song that introduces us to Rapunzel. Mother Knows Best and I've Got a Dream are good in their own ways but are somewhat forgettable nonetheless.That's my review of Tangled. It's a funny, heartwarming, beautiful, witty and enchanting movie that audiences of all ages can enjoy.",NA
"TANGLED","Simarium","9 August 2018","This movie has a pretty weak soundtrack compared to most Disney movies. But, on the flip side, Flynn Ryder is fairly memorable, and the animation is beautiful. My main criticism is that Ryder's past and development as a character was dove into quite enough for my tastes.",NA
"TANGLED","d-82284","29 March 2020","The plot of the story is simple: the beautiful and kind princess has a very beautiful and very long hair, and the witch uses the princess' magical long hair to keep her youth forever. The princess secretly took the princess out of the palace from an early age, told the princess that the world outside was very evil, and imprisoned the princess on the tower. The beautiful princess can only see the outside world through the window every day. On the princess's birthday, there are always many sky lanterns flying in the night sky, because their appearance makes the princess be emotional and curious about the outside world. The appearance of thief Ryder gave the princess the courage to step out of the tower. Then he revealed the evil face of the witch, returned to the palace, and Ryder also had a beautiful love.",NA
"TANGLED","cnycitylady","29 December 2012","When was the last time we got a Disney Princess we loved so much? Repunzel in Disney's Tangled is the newest and by god she's awesome! With this story Disney added a new twist to a classic tale without losing sight of the endearing story that young girls loved so much. And they utilized it in a way so that boys aren't left out. I know so many boys and men who love this movie. There is just something in the characters that speak out to the audience and pulls you in. Flynn Rider (or Eugene) is the lovable thief who steals Rapunzel's heart when he helps her fulfill her dream. And Rapunzel is the quirky, innocent shut in who comes out of her shell and opens her heart to all the wonders of the world and all of the wonders of love when she gains Flynn's love in exchange for her own. The animation is startlingly colorful and superb. Disney went with the computer animation, against its usual hand drawn animations for a Princess tale, but for the story they provided you find that it works well, hell, maybe even better than the hand drawings would have. For the characters who are very ""Chibi"" like, they emit real human faults and feelings. Their facial expressions just kill you as you see the pain, excitement, joy, love and regret in their eyes. The songs are good catchy tunes, sure to echo in your mind long after the movie has ended. And the villainy is terrific. Mother Gothel is one of the greatest Disney villains ever created. She not only steals the baby princess but raises her and then still has no qualms about hurting her physically and mentally. She never got all mushy and redeeming, she knew what she wanted and how to get it and she stood evil until the end, a good trait in any bad guy. Tangled may be the equivalent to Disney's The Little Mermaid because, just like back in the 80s the world had just about given up on Disney, but after seeing this movie, you will be a believer again.",NA
"TANGLED","elisabethnieshalla","24 October 2019","""Flower gleam and glow. Let your powers shine. Make the clock reverse..."" so I can re-watch Tangled over and over again! The girl, the guy, the chameleon sidekick, the comical horse, the evil mother - this film has all the essential aspects that make an incredible Disney princess movie. More than that, however, it offers a fresh plot that takes a heartwarming spin on the beloved classic story of Rapunzel. Even if the average princess movie isn't typically your thing, I encourage you to give Tangled a shot. Its humor, music, and genuine characters may just take you by surprise and capture your heart like they did mine.It all starts with a single flower. The king and queen of Corona are expecting a child, but when the child's time comes to be born, the queen falls very ill. The only thing that can save her is a magic golden flower. Our villain, Mother Gothel, has been using the flower's healing powers to keep herself young, but she loses her source of life when the flower is picked and taken to heal the queen. However, the baby girl (Rapunzel) is born with beautiful long, blonde hair that has the magical qualities of the flower. So Gothel steals the baby and takes her to a hidden tower where the evil woman raises Rapunzel as her own, using the girl's hair to preserve her own youth. Every year on Rapunzel's birthday, the kingdom lets up thousands of floating lanterns to remember the lost princess; and every year, the lost princess watches from her tower window and wonders if maybe those lanterns are somehow meant for her.Our heroine, Rapunzel, is the epitome of beauty and delight. Mother Gothel has kept the free spirit of her ""flower"" caged in the tower for her entire life, but with the princess' eighteenth birthday drawing near, the young girl is ready to take that step of rebellion and adventure. A desperate, love-struck, helpless female victim is something that Rapunzel most definitely is not. She is far above her fellow princesses, such as Cinderella and Snow White, and is a positive influence on little and grown up girls alike. She exudes confidence and loving-kindness that inspires one to see the beauty in every person and in every situation. Her beautiful golden hair is an important part of who she is, but that is not where she places her identity. Although Rapunzel is not perfect, her faults give her character a realness and relatability. She learns from her mistakes and continues to fight for the things that matter most. Rapunzel embodies independence, bravery, adventure, passion, and beauty, and she's not too bad with the frying pan either.Enter Flynn Rider: a thief who has stolen the princess' crown from the castle and, in his escape, happens upon Rapunzel's dwelling place. He climbs up the tower, and just when he thinks he is out of danger, he is hit on the head with a loud dong. Rapunzel stands stunned with her frying pan in hand. In a moment of pure childlike wonder, she stares at the unconscious intruder. Despite Mother Gothel's strict orders to never leave the tower, Rapunzel orders charismatic Flynn to take her to see the flying lanterns. Together, they face every kind of adventure from dream-filled drunkards to palace guards to a very stubborn horse, and what starts out as an obligation quickly turns into a caring friendship, and eventually a sweet romance. Flynn guides Rapunzel to discover who she truly is, and she helps him see his worth apart from being a criminal.A believable, powerful, sweet love story in Disney princess movies can prove to be a rare occurrence, but Tangled fulfills this essential quality through Flynn and Rapunzel's romance. Their love comes to fruition in an inexpressibly stunning scene where they are in a boat with the floating lanterns all around them. The magic of the moment is captivating as the lanterns' glittering reflections in the water and their encompassing glow creates a beautiful, magical, and romantic atmosphere. However, a good love story is not without trials. So often, the love story in Disney princess movies is shallow and fails to show the selflessness of love. If you are weary of ""love at first sight"" and desperate female figures being swept off their feet by a rich, handsome prince, then Tangled will surely offer some fresh and enjoyable entertainment. As you will see in the end, their love transcends infatuation and shows that true love requires sacrifice.It would do the film injustice if I did not also mention the incredible soundtrack that enhances this story. You don't have to be sitting on your couch in front of your television to experience the wonderment of this endearing film, for the lyrics and compositions so appropriately capture the emotions of the moments in which they are sung. Not only are they geniusly written, but for me these songs are the centerpiece of so many precious memories. Whether you're dramatically acting them out in the car with friends or screaming them at the top of your lungs in the dish room at camp, the soundtrack isn't just for the film; it's a soundtrack for your life. From the haunting melody of the ""Healing Incantation"" to the joyous and lighthearted ""I've Got A Dream,"" the music will have you leaving with a smile in your heart and a skip in your step.At the end of any great movie, justice is served. The ending must be satisfying yet not too predictable. Tangled checks the box for a fantastic ending. It introduces real life themes of death and loss but also of love and sacrifice. As this journey you've gone on with the characters comes to its climax, your mind is spinning trying to determine how it all will end. When I sat in the theater in 2010 watching the film for the first time as a seven-year-old girl, a gasp rose from the audience as the gripping moment came to fruition. This enthralling end will have you on the edge of your seat with suspense and excitement, but you will ultimately walk away with a genuine sense of joy and satisfaction. The conclusion of this story is not completely perfect and happy, but that makes it real, for in life there is always a price to pay for the things most worth having.Rapunzel's hair and its magical powers seem to be the center of the story. That was why Mother Gothel stole her in the first place and why she was never allowed to leave the tower. In the end, however, it's not about her beautiful magic hair, but about the importance of courage, the steadfastness of a family, and the power of true love. Disney hit the sweet spot with this princess movie. Its heroine, though not without flaws, has a strong, confident, exuberant personality that captures your heart and inspires you to relentlessly chase after your dreams. Rapunzel and Flynn's love story is genuine and believable, a rarity among other Disney princess movies, and the music is music for the soul. Real, raw justice is served that gives you a fulfilled spirit to go out and face the world with courage. The next time you sit down for movie night, I encourage you to give Tangled a chance, for his film isn't just an hour and a half of quality entertainment, it is an endearing story that will leave you changed for the better and for good.",NA
"TANGLED","YesthatChristine","24 November 2010","I took my two boys to see this, the older of which was kind of irked at being dragged to a 'princess' movie but I'm happy to report we all enjoyed it. The only reason I'm really writing a review (since its getting enough positive reviews to really cover most of what I liked about it) is to say that there IS a reason to see it besides the 3D effects.I am not a huge fan of 3D films, in fact, it is rare that I don't find it to be a distraction. Frankly I don't WANT to be tricked into believing I'm actually *in* the film unless I'm at an amusement park, perhaps. I like my distance from the goings-on within the picture.We saw this without 3D and the breathtaking scenery was more than enough to feed the senses on its own. Don't feel like you need to shell out the extra 8 bucks for 3D (the upgrade in cost per matinée ticket in my neck of the woods) because its perfectly enjoyable without it. All that being said, it doesn't have quite the clout or likability of the very best Disney when it comes to the songs and pacing, but I would still give this picture a low A, recommend it for family viewing and see it again with a friend if they wanted to. This was far and away better than the Frog Princess, a film which I found terrified my youngest child and bored my older one.",NA
"TANGLED","johnnymacbest","5 December 2010","What a joyful movie. Generally, I'm not an animated movie fan(especially the CG type) but this is an exception. Filled with witty songs and dialog with stunning vistas and voice acting, ""Tangled"" is not only a film, it's also a metaphor for the many conflicting emotions the characters exhibit in the film such as Rapunzel's desire to see the outside world, to Mother Gothel wanting to shelter her from it(for reasons unknown to her but to the audience) to Flynn wanting to make a name for himself. I was utterly surprised despite being a kid's film, it also touches on some pretty adult subject matter such as ageism, selfishness, desire, and love. That was really unexpected from a film of this type. Although it is loosely based on the legend of Rumplestilskin, Tangled is one of the best animated films of this year. See it in 3D to get the full effect.",NA
