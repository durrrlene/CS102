"1","Seamless Human Motion Composition with Blended Positional Encodings","German Barquero, Sergio Escalera, Cristina Palmero","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Conditional human motion generation is an important topic with many applications in virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. While prior works have focused on generating motion guided by text, music, or scenes, these typically result in isolated motions confined to short durations. Instead, we address the generation of long, continuous sequences guided by a series of varying textual descriptions. In this context, we introduce FlowMDM, the first diffusion-based model that generates seamless Human Motion Compositions (HMC) without any postprocessing or redundant denoising steps. For this, we introduce the Blended Positional Encodings, a technique that leverages both absolute and relative positional encodings in the denoising chain. More specifically, global motion coherence is recovered at the absolute stage, whereas smooth and realistic transitions are built at the relative stage. As a result, we achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of accuracy, realism, and smoothness on the Babel and HumanML3D datasets. FlowMDM excels when trained with only a single description per motion sequence thanks to its Pose-Centric Cross-ATtention, which makes it robust against varying text descriptions at inference time. Finally, to address the limitations of existing HMC metrics, we propose two new metrics: the Peak Jerk and the Area Under the Jerk, to detect abrupt transitions.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:59:40 UTC (15,139 KB)"

However, fully harnessing the potential of LLMs for agent-based tasks presents inherent challenges due to the heterogeneous nature of diverse data sources featuring multi-turn trajectories.

It meticulously standardizes and unifies these trajectories into a consistent format, streamlining the creation of a generic data loader optimized for agent training. Leveraging the data unification, our training pipeline maintains equilibrium across different data sources and preserves independent randomness across devices during dataset partitioning and model training. Additionally, we present \textbf{xLAM-v0.1}, a large action model tailored for AI agents, which demonstrates exceptional performance across various benchmarks.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:56:26 UTC (3,748 KB)"
"3","Co-Supervised Learning: Improving Weak-to-Strong Generalization with Hierarchical Mixture of Experts","Yuejiang Liu, Alexandre Alahi","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Steering the behavior of a strong model pre-trained on internet-scale data can be difficult due to the scarcity of competent supervisors. Recent studies reveal that, despite supervisory noises, a strong student model may surpass its weak teacher when fine-tuned on specific objectives. Yet, the effectiveness of such weak-to-strong generalization remains limited, especially in the presence of large capability gaps. In this paper, we propose to address this challenge by harnessing a diverse set of specialized teachers, instead of a single generalist one, that collectively supervises the strong student. Our approach resembles the classical hierarchical mixture of experts, with two components tailored for co-supervision: (i) we progressively alternate student training and teacher assignment, leveraging the growth of the strong student to identify plausible supervisions; (ii) we conservatively enforce teacher-student and local-global consistency, leveraging their dependencies to reject potential annotation noises. We validate the proposed method through visual recognition tasks on the OpenAI weak-to-strong benchmark and additional multi-domain datasets.

Kung, Yubei Chen","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Recent text-to-image diffusion models are able to learn and synthesize images containing novel, personalized concepts (e.g., their own pets or specific items) with just a few examples for training. This paper tackles two interconnected issues within this realm of personalizing text-to-image diffusion models. First, current personalization techniques fail to reliably extend to multiple concepts -- we hypothesize this to be due to the mismatch between complex scenes and simple text descriptions in the pre-training dataset (e.g., LAION). Second, given an image containing multiple personalized concepts, there lacks a holistic metric that evaluates performance on not just the degree of resemblance of personalized concepts, but also whether all concepts are present in the image and whether the image accurately reflects the overall text description. To address these issues, we introduce Gen4Gen, a semi-automated dataset creation pipeline utilizing generative models to combine personalized concepts into complex compositions along with text-descriptions. Using this, we create a dataset called MyCanvas, that can be used to benchmark the task of multi-concept personalization. In addition, we design a comprehensive metric comprising two scores (CP-CLIP and TI-CLIP) for better quantifying the performance of multi-concept, personalized text-to-image diffusion methods. We provide a simple baseline built on top of Custom Diffusion with empirical prompting strategies for future researchers to evaluate on MyCanvas. We show that by improving data quality and prompting strategies, we can significantly increase multi-concept personalized image generation quality, without requiring any modifications to model architecture or training algorithms.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:55:09 UTC (24,656 KB)"
"5","On the Complexity of Community-aware Network Sparsification","Emanuel Herrendorf, Christian Komusiewicz, Nils Morawietz, Frank Sommer","Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)","Network sparsification is the task of reducing the number of edges of a given graph while preserving some crucial graph property. In community-aware network sparsification, the preserved property concerns the subgraphs that are induced by the communities of the graph which are given as vertex subsets. This is formalized in the $\Pi$-Network Sparsification problem: given an edge-weighted graph $G$, a collection $Z$ of $c$ subsets of $V(G)$ (communities), and two numbers $\ell, b$, the question is whether there exists a spanning subgraph $G'$ of $G$ with at most $\ell$ edges of total weight at most $b$ such that $G'[C]$ fulfills $\Pi$ for each community $C$. Here, we consider two graph properties $\Pi$: the connectivity property (Connectivity NWS) and the property of having a spanning star (Stars NWS). Since both problems are NP-hard, we study their parameterized and fine-grained complexity. We provide a tight $2^{\Omega(n^2+c)} poly(n+|Z|)$-time running time lower bound based on the ETH for both problems, where $n$ is the number of vertices in $G$. The lower bound holds even in the restricted case when all communities have size at most 4, $G$ is a clique, and every edge has unit weight. For the connectivity property, the unit weight case with $G$ being a clique is the well-studied problem of computing a hypergraph support with a minimum number of edges. We then study the complexity of both problems parameterized by the feedback edge number $t$ of the solution graph $G'$. For Stars NWS, we present an XP-algorithm for $t$. This answers an open question by Korach and Stern [Disc. Appl. Math. '08] who asked for the existence of polynomial-time algorithms for $t=0$. In contrast, we show for Connectivity NWS that known polynomial-time algorithms for $t=0$ [Korach and Stern, Math. Program. '03; Klemz et al., SWAT '14] cannot be extended by showing that Connectivity NWS is NP-hard for $t=1$.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:32:39 UTC (165 KB)"

As the volume and scale of structures and the impact of their failure continue to grow, there is a dire need for SHM techniques that are scalable, inexpensive, operate passively without human intervention, and customized for each mechanical structure without the need for complex baseline models. We present a novel ""deploy-and-forget"" approach for automated detection and localization of damages in structures. It is based on a synergistic combination of fully passive measurements from inexpensive sensors and a mechanics-informed autoencoder. Once deployed, our solution continuously learns and adapts a bespoke baseline model for each structure, learning from its undamaged state's response characteristics. After learning from just 3 hours of data, it can autonomously detect and localize different types of unforeseen damage. Results from numerical simulations and experiments indicate that incorporating the mechanical characteristics into the variational autoencoder allows for up to 35\% earlier detection and localization of damage over a standard autoencoder. Our approach holds substantial promise for a significant reduction in human intervention and inspection costs and enables proactive and preventive maintenance strategies, thus extending the lifespan, reliability, and sustainability of civil infrastructures.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:31:02 UTC (1,149 KB)"

In this paper, we focus on the task of identifying, curating, and transforming existing datasets and, in turn, introduce API-BLEND, a large corpora for training and systematic testing of tool-augmented LLMs. The datasets mimic real-world scenarios involving API-tasks such as API / tool detection, slot filling, and sequencing of the detected APIs.

Prior work has proposed building scene graphs of the environment but typically assumes that the environment is static, omitting regions that require active interactions. This severely limits their ability to handle more complex tasks in household and office environments: before setting up a table, robots must explore drawers and cabinets to locate all utensils and condiments. In this work, we introduce the novel task of interactive scene exploration, wherein robots autonomously explore environments and produce an action-conditioned scene graph (ACSG) that captures the structure of the underlying environment. The ACSG accounts for both low-level information, such as geometry and semantics, and high-level information, such as the action-conditioned relationships between different entities in the scene. To this end, we present the Robotic Exploration (RoboEXP) system, which incorporates the Large Multimodal Model (LMM) and an explicit memory design to enhance our system's capabilities. The robot reasons about what and how to explore an object, accumulating new information through the interaction process and incrementally constructing the ACSG. We apply our system across various real-world settings in a zero-shot manner, demonstrating its effectiveness in exploring and modeling environments it has never seen before. Leveraging the constructed ACSG, we illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our RoboEXP system in facilitating a wide range of real-world manipulation tasks involving rigid, articulated objects, nested objects like Matryoshka dolls, and deformable objects like cloth.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:27:17 UTC (23,855 KB)"

Oftentimes, one aims to find a $k$-partitioning with a smaller cut value for such networks by moving only a few nodes across partitions. The number of nodes that can be moved across partitions is often a constraint forced by budgetary limitations. Motivated by such real-world applications, we introduce and study the $r$-move $k$-partitioning~problem, a natural variant of the Multiway cut problem. Given a graph, a set of $k$ terminals and an initial partitioning of the graph, the $r$-move $k$-partitioning~problem aims to find a $k$-partitioning with the minimum-weighted cut among all the $k$-partitionings that can be obtained by moving at most $r$ non-terminal nodes to partitions different from their initial ones. Our main result is a polynomial time $3(r+1)$ approximation algorithm for this problem. We further show that this problem is $W[1]$-hard, and give an FPTAS for when $r$ is a small constant.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:25:54 UTC (757 KB)"

However, prior discrimination measuring frameworks solely assess the average discriminatory behavior of LLMs, often proving inadequate due to the overlook of an additional discrimination-leading factor, i.e., the LLMs' prediction variation across diverse contexts. In this work, we present the Prejudice-Caprice Framework (PCF) that comprehensively measures discrimination in LLMs by considering both their consistently biased preference and preference variation across diverse contexts. Specifically, we mathematically dissect the aggregated contextualized discrimination risk of LLMs into prejudice risk, originating from LLMs' persistent prejudice, and caprice risk, stemming from their generation inconsistency. In addition, we utilize a data-mining approach to gather preference-detecting probes from sentence skeletons, devoid of attribute indications, to approximate LLMs' applied contexts. While initially intended for assessing discrimination in LLMs, our proposed PCF facilitates the comprehensive and flexible measurement of any inductive biases, including knowledge alongside prejudice, across various modality models. We apply our discrimination-measuring framework to 12 common LLMs, yielding intriguing findings: i) modern LLMs demonstrate significant pro-male stereotypes, ii) LLMs' exhibited discrimination correlates with several social and economic factors, iii) prejudice risk dominates the overall discrimination risk and follows a normal distribution, and iv) caprice risk contributes minimally to the overall risk but follows a fat-tailed distribution, suggesting that it is wild risk requiring enhanced surveillance.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:15:56 UTC (8,549 KB)"

This study investigates whether retinotopic mapping, a critical component of foveated vision, can enhance image categorization and localization performance when integrated into deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Retinotopic mapping was integrated into the inputs of standard off-the-shelf convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which were then retrained on the ImageNet task. As expected, the logarithmic-polar mapping improved the network's ability to handle arbitrary image zooms and rotations, particularly for isolated objects. Surprisingly, the retinotopically mapped network achieved comparable performance in classification. Furthermore, the network demonstrated improved classification localization when the foveated center of the transform was shifted. This replicates a crucial ability of the human visual system that is absent in typical convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These findings suggest that retinotopic mapping may be fundamental to significant preattentive visual processes.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:15:37 UTC (33,786 KB)"

Given their widespread adoption, several works have attempted to analyze the expressivity of Transformers. Expressivity of a neural network is the class of functions it can approximate. A neural network is fully expressive if it can act as a universal function approximator. We attempt to analyze the same for Transformers. Contrary to existing claims, our findings reveal that Transformers struggle to reliably approximate continuous functions, relying on piecewise constant approximations with sizable intervals. The central question emerges as: ""\textit{Are Transformers truly Universal Function Approximators}?"" To address this, we conduct a thorough investigation, providing theoretical insights and supporting evidence through experiments. Our contributions include a theoretical analysis pinpointing the root of Transformers' limitation in function approximation and extensive experiments to verify the limitation.

Romano","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","We tackle the problem of bias mitigation of algorithmic decisions in a setting where both the output of the algorithm and the sensitive variable are continuous. Most of prior work deals with discrete sensitive variables, meaning that the biases are measured for subgroups of persons defined by a label, leaving out important algorithmic bias cases, where the sensitive variable is continuous. Typical examples are unfair decisions made with respect to the age or the financial status. In our work, we then propose a bias mitigation strategy for continuous sensitive variables, based on the notion of endogeneity which comes from the field of econometrics. In addition to solve this new problem, our bias mitigation strategy is a weakly supervised learning method which requires that a small portion of the data can be measured in a fair manner. It is model agnostic, in the sense that it does not make any hypothesis on the prediction model. It also makes use of a reasonably large amount of input observations and their corresponding predictions. Only a small fraction of the true output predictions should be known. This therefore limits the need for expert interventions. Results obtained on synthetic data show the effectiveness of our approach for examples as close as possible to real-life applications in econometrics.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:11:32 UTC (9,736 KB)"

The key to the strategy is employing a reward model ({$\varphi$}) which can reflect a latent reward model with humans. While this strategy has proven to be effective, the training methodology requires a lot of human preference annotation (usually of the order of tens of thousands) to train {$\varphi$}. Such large-scale preference annotations can be achievable if the reward model can be ubiquitously used. However, human values/goals are subjective and depend on the nature of the task. This poses a challenge in collecting diverse preferences for downstream applications. To address this, we propose a novel methodology to infuse domain knowledge into {$\varphi$}, which reduces the size of preference annotation required. We validate our approach in E-Commerce Opinion Summarization, with a significant reduction in dataset size (just $940$ samples) while advancing the state-of-the-art. Our contributions include a novel Reward Modelling technique, a new dataset (PromptOpinSumm) for Opinion Summarization, and a human preference dataset (OpinPref).

Weak supervision offers a promising alternative by accelerating the creation of labeled training data using domain-specific rules. However, it requires users to write a diverse set of high-quality rules to assign labels to the unlabeled data. Automatic Rule Induction (ARI) approaches circumvent this problem by automatically creating rules from features on a small labeled set and filtering a final set of rules from them. In the ARI approach, the crucial step is to filter out a set of a high-quality useful subset of rules from the large set of automatically created rules. In this paper, we propose an algorithm (Filtering of Automatically Induced Rules) to filter rules from a large number of automatically induced rules using submodular objective functions that account for the collective precision, coverage, and conflicts of the rule set. We experiment with three ARI approaches and five text classification datasets to validate the superior performance of our algorithm with respect to several semi-supervised label aggregation approaches. Further, we show that achieves statistically significant results in comparison to existing rule-filtering approaches.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:04:54 UTC (1,203 KB)"

Panoptic segmentation is a promising perception technique to identify and categorise objects, impending hazards, and driveable space at a pixel level. While segmentation quality is generally associated with the quality of the camera data, a comprehensive understanding and modelling of this relationship are paramount for AAD system designers. Motivated by such a need, this work proposes a unifying pipeline to assess the robustness of panoptic segmentation models for AAD, correlating it with traditional image quality. The first step of the proposed pipeline involves generating degraded camera data that reflects real-world noise factors. To this end, 19 noise factors have been identified and implemented with 3 severity levels. Of these factors, this work proposes novel models for unfavourable light and snow. After applying the degradation models, three state-of-the-art CNN- and vision transformers (ViT)-based panoptic segmentation networks are used to analyse their robustness. The variations of the segmentation performance are then correlated to 8 selected image quality metrics. This research reveals that: 1) certain specific noise factors produce the highest impact on panoptic segmentation, i.e. droplets on lens and Gaussian noise; 2) the ViT-based panoptic segmentation backbones show better robustness to the considered noise factors; 3) some image quality metrics (i.e. LPIPS and CW-SSIM) correlate strongly with panoptic segmentation performance and therefore they can be used as predictive metrics for network performance.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:00:06 UTC (43,849 KB)"

The registration problem can be formulated as a graph and solved by finding its maximum clique. This formulation leads to extreme robustness to outliers; however, finding the maximum clique is an NP-hard problem, and therefore approximation is required in practice for large-size problems. The performance of an approximation algorithm is evaluated by its computational complexity (the lower the runtime, the better) and solution accuracy (how close the solution is to the maximum clique). Accordingly, the main contribution of CLIPPER+ is outperforming the state-of-the-art in accuracy while maintaining a relatively low runtime. CLIPPER+ builds on prior work (CLIPPER [1] and PMC [2]) and prunes the graph by removing vertices that have a small core number and cannot be a part of the maximum clique. This will result in a smaller graph, on which the maximum clique can be estimated considerably faster. We evaluate the performance of CLIPPER+ on standard graph benchmarks, as well as synthetic and real-world point cloud registration problems. These evaluations demonstrate that CLIPPER+ has the highest accuracy and can register point clouds in scenarios where over $99\%$ of associations are outliers.

However, this aspect has primarily been investigated under a single load condition, where stress in 2D can be described by two orthogonal principal stress directions. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for designing and optimizing triangular lattice structures to accommodate multiple loading conditions, which means multiple stress fields. Our method comprises two main steps: homogenization-based topology optimization and geometry-based de-homogenization. To ensure the geometric regularity of triangular lattices, we propose a simplified version of the general rank-$3$ laminate and parameterize the design domain using equilateral triangles with unique thickness per edge. During optimization, the thicknesses and orientation of each equilateral triangle are adjusted based on the homogenized properties of triangular lattices. Our numerical findings demonstrate that this proposed simplification results in only a slight decrease in stiffness, while achieving triangular lattice structures with a compelling geometric regularity. In geometry-based de-homogenization, we adopt a field-aligned triangulation approach to generate a globally consistent triangle mesh, with each triangle oriented according to the optimized orientation field. Our approach for handling multiple loading conditions, akin to de-homogenization techniques for single loading conditions, yields highly detailed, optimized, spatially varying lattice structures. The method is computationally efficient, as simulations and optimizations are conducted at a low-resolution discretization of the design domain. Furthermore, since our approach is geometry-based, obtained structures are encoded into a compact geometric format that facilitates downstream operations such as editing and fabrication.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 17:33:07 UTC (5,649 KB)"

To address this limitation, we propose a simple approach, ""echo embeddings,"" in which we repeat the input twice in context and extract embeddings from the second occurrence.

"24","Computer Vision for Multimedia Geolocation in Human Trafficking Investigation: A Systematic Literature Review","Opeyemi Bamigbade, John Sheppard, Mark Scanlon","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","The task of multimedia geolocation is becoming an increasingly essential component of the digital forensics toolkit to effectively combat human trafficking, child sexual exploitation, and other illegal acts. Typically, metadata-based geolocation information is stripped when multimedia content is shared via instant messaging and social media. The intricacy of geolocating, geotagging, or finding geographical clues in this content is often overly burdensome for investigators. Recent research has shown that contemporary advancements in artificial intelligence, specifically computer vision and deep learning, show significant promise towards expediting the multimedia geolocation task. This systematic literature review thoroughly examines the state-of-the-art leveraging computer vision techniques for multimedia geolocation and assesses their potential to expedite human trafficking investigation. This includes a comprehensive overview of the application of computer vision-based approaches to multimedia geolocation, identifies their applicability in combating human trafficking, and highlights the potential implications of enhanced multimedia geolocation for prosecuting human trafficking. 123 articles inform this systematic literature review. The findings suggest numerous potential paths for future impactful research on the subject.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 17:23:06 UTC (8,758 KB)"

To achieve privacy, certain functionalities in credentials should be implemented. One is selective disclosure, which allows users to disclose only the claims or attributes they want. This paper presents a novel approach to selective disclosure that combines Merkle hash trees and Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signatures. Combining these approaches, we achieve selective disclosure of claims in a single credential and creation of a verifiable presentation containing selectively disclosed claims from multiple credentials signed by different parties. Besides selective disclosure, we enable issuing credentials signed by multiple issuers using this approach.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 17:20:28 UTC (633 KB)"
"26","Can we forget how we learned? Doxastic redundancy in iterated belief revision","Paolo Liberatore","Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)","How information was acquired may become irrelevant. An obvious case is when something is confirmed many times. In terms of iterated belief revision, a specific revision may become irrelevant in presence of others. Simple repetitions are an example, but not the only case when this happens. Sometimes, a revision becomes redundant even in presence of none equal, or even no else implying it. A necessary and sufficient condition for the redundancy of the first of a sequence of lexicographic revisions is given. The problem is coNP-complete even with two propositional revisions only. Complexity is the same in the Horn case but only with an unbounded number of revisions: it becomes polynomial with two revisions. Lexicographic revisions are not only relevant by themselves, but also because sequences of them are the most compact of the common mechanisms used to represent the state of an iterated revision process. Shortening sequences of lexicographic revisions is shortening the most compact representations of iterated belief revision states.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 17:09:04 UTC (37 KB)"

The information from different modalities will work together to measure the triple plausibility. Existing MMKGC methods overlook the imbalance problem of modality information among entities, resulting in inadequate modal fusion and inefficient utilization of the raw modality information. To address the mentioned problems, we propose Adaptive Multi-modal Fusion and Modality Adversarial Training (AdaMF-MAT) to unleash the power of imbalanced modality information for MMKGC. AdaMF-MAT achieves multi-modal fusion with adaptive modality weights and further generates adversarial samples by modality-adversarial training to enhance the imbalanced modality information.

In this study, we leveraged data from more than 1.2 million anonymized human mobility communications across 30 parishes in Louisiana to construct a temporal network that tracks visitation to places from which we characterized human lifestyle signatures before, during, and after Hurricane Ida in 2021. Utilizing the motif model, we distilled complex human lifestyles into identifiable patterns and clustered them into classes: commute, healthcare, dining out, and youth-oriented lifestyle. We defined two metrics to evaluate disruption and recovery fluctuations in lifestyle patterns during the perturbation period compared to the steady period: 1) frequency (daily number of motifs), and 2) proximity (daily average distance of motifs). The results indicate significant dynamics in lifestyle patterns due to the hurricane, with essential facilities (e.g., healthcare) demonstrating a swift recovery. The study underscores the heterogeneity of locations visited and the necessity of integrating both essential and non-essential facilities into disaster response initiatives. Furthermore, our study reveals sustained changes in lifestyle patterns, highlighting the long-term impact of the hurricane on daily life. These insights demonstrate the significance of examining lifestyle signatures and their fluctuations in evaluating disaster resilience patterns for affected communities. The outcomes of this study are poised to aid emergency managers and public officials to more effectively evaluate and monitor disaster impacts and recovery based on changes in lifestyle patterns in the community.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 16:52:04 UTC (9,793 KB)"

The optimal error rate for recovering cluster labels in Gaussian and sub-Gaussian mixture models involves ad hoc signal-to-noise ratios. Simple iterative algorithms, such as Lloyd's algorithm, attain this optimal error rate. In this paper, we first establish a universal lower bound for the error rate in clustering any mixture model, expressed through a Chernoff divergence, a more versatile measure of model information than signal-to-noise ratios. We then demonstrate that iterative algorithms attain this lower bound in mixture models with sub-exponential tails, notably emphasizing location-scale mixtures featuring Laplace-distributed errors. Additionally, for datasets better modelled by Poisson or Negative Binomial mixtures, we study mixture models whose distributions belong to an exponential family. In such mixtures, we establish that Bregman hard clustering, a variant of Lloyd's algorithm employing a Bregman divergence, is rate optimal.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 16:51:17 UTC (44 KB)"

In this regard, a promising paradigm considers embedding task-required invariant structures, e.g., geometric invariance, in the fundamental image representation. However, such invariant representations typically exhibit limited discriminability, limiting their applications in larger-scale trustworthy vision tasks. For this open problem, we conduct a systematic investigation of hierarchical invariance, exploring this topic from theoretical, practical, and application perspectives. At the theoretical level, we show how to construct over-complete invariants with a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-like hierarchical architecture yet in a fully interpretable manner. The general blueprint, specific definitions, invariant properties, and numerical implementations are provided. At the practical level, we discuss how to customize this theoretical framework into a given task. With the over-completeness, discriminative features w.r.t. the task can be adaptively formed in a Neural Architecture Search (NAS)-like manner. We demonstrate the above arguments with accuracy, invariance, and efficiency results on texture, digit, and parasite classification experiments. Furthermore, at the application level, our representations are explored in real-world forensics tasks on adversarial perturbations and Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC). Such applications reveal that the proposed strategy not only realizes the theoretically promised invariance, but also exhibits competitive discriminability even in the era of deep learning. For robust and interpretable vision tasks at larger scales, hierarchical invariant representation can be considered as an effective alternative to traditional CNN and invariants.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 16:50:07 UTC (8,248 KB)"

However, as is common with many Deep Learning (DL) models, DMs are subject to a lack of robustness. While there are attempts to evaluate the robustness of T2I DMs as a binary or worst-case problem, they cannot answer how robust in general the model is whenever an adversarial example (AE) can be found. In this study, we first introduce a probabilistic notion of T2I DMs' robustness; and then establish an efficient framework, ProTIP, to evaluate it with statistical guarantees. The main challenges stem from: i) the high computational cost of the generation process; and ii) determining if a perturbed input is an AE involves comparing two output distributions, which is fundamentally harder compared to other DL tasks like classification where an AE is identified upon misprediction of labels. To tackle the challenges, we employ sequential analysis with efficacy and futility early stopping rules in the statistical testing for identifying AEs, and adaptive concentration inequalities to dynamically determine the ""just-right"" number of stochastic perturbations whenever the verification target is met. Empirical experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ProTIP over common T2I DMs. Finally, we demonstrate an application of ProTIP to rank commonly used defence methods.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 16:48:56 UTC (15,820 KB)"

To thwart the cache-based side-channel attacks, two types of countermeasures have been proposed: detection-based ones that limit the amount of microarchitectural traces an attacker can leave, and cache prefetching-and-locking techniques that claim to prevent such leakage by disallowing evictions on sensitive data. In this paper, we present the Prime+Retouch attack that completely bypasses these defense schemes by accurately inferring the cache activities with the metadata of the cache replacement policy. Prime+Retouch has three noticeable properties: 1) it incurs no eviction on the victim's data, allowing us to bypass the two known mitigation schemes, 2) it requires minimal synchronization of only one memory access to the attacker's pre-primed cache lines, and 3) it leaks data via non-shared memory, yet because underlying eviction metadata is shared. We demonstrate Prime+Retouch in two architectures: predominant Intel x86 and emerging Apple M1. We elucidate how Prime+Retouch can break the T-table implementation of AES with robust cache side-channel mitigations such as Cloak, under both normal and SGX-protected environments. We also manifest feasibility of the Prime+Retouch attack on the M1 platform imposing more restrictions where the precise measurement tools such as core clock cycle timer and performance counters are inaccessible to the attacker. Furthermore, we first demystify undisclosed cache architecture and its eviction policy of L1 data cache on Apple M1 architecture. We also devise a user-space noise-free cache monitoring tool by repurposing Intel TSX.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 16:34:49 UTC (4,106 KB)"

A new mutual coupling aware algorithm is derived where the reactance of each element is updated successively with a closed-form solution. In comparison to existing element-wise methods, this approach leads to a considerably reduced computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce decoupling networks for the RIS array as a potential solution for handling mutual coupling. With these networks, the system model reduces to the same structure as when no mutual coupling were present. Including decoupling networks, we can optimize the channel gain of a RIS-aided SISO system in closed-form which allows to analyze the scenario under mutual coupling analytically and to draw connections to the conventional transmit array gain. In particular, a super-quadratic channel gain can be achieved which scales as N^4 where N is the number of RIS elements.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 16:33:49 UTC (530 KB)"

We show that fine-tuning on hallucination-free data effectively reduces hallucinations from 2.60 to 1.55 per summary for Llama 2, while preserving relevant information. Although the effect is still present, it is much smaller for GPT-4 when prompted with five examples (0.70 to 0.40). We also conduct a qualitative evaluation using hallucination-free and improved training data. GPT-4 shows very good results even in the zero-shot setting. We find that common quantitative metrics do not correlate well with faithfulness and quality.

However, formulating realistic policies for robots demands responses from humans to an extensive array of queries.

To accomplish this, we leverage the zero-shot capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to reason from the text provided by humans. To accommodate the additional query information, we reformulate the reward learning objectives to contain flexible highlights -- state-action pairs that contain relatively high information and are related to the features processed in a zero-shot fashion from a pretrained LLM. In both a simulated scenario and a user study, we reveal the effectiveness of our work by analyzing the feedback and its implications.

This paper shows how algorithm aversion arises when the choice to follow an algorithm conveys information about a human's ability. I develop a model in which workers make forecasts of a random outcome based on their own private information and an algorithm's signal. Low-skill workers receive worse information than the algorithm and hence should always follow the algorithm's signal, while high-skill workers receive better information than the algorithm and should sometimes override it. However, due to reputational concerns, low-skill workers inefficiently override the algorithm to increase the likelihood they are perceived as high-skill. The model provides a fully rational microfoundation for algorithm aversion that aligns with the broad concern that AI systems will displace many types of workers.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 16:28:55 UTC (307 KB)"

Specifically, the efficiency of low-rank adaptation has facilitated the creation and sharing of hundreds of custom LoRA modules, each trained on distinct data from various downstream tasks. In this paper, we explore the composability of LoRA modules, examining if combining these pre-trained modules enhances generalization to unseen downstream tasks. Our investigation involves evaluating two approaches: (a) uniform composition, involving averaging upstream LoRA modules with equal weights, and (b) learned composition, where we learn the weights for each upstream module and perform weighted averaging. Our experimental results on both vision and language models reveal that in few-shot settings, where only a limited number of samples are available for the downstream task, both uniform and learned composition methods result in better transfer accuracy; outperforming full fine-tuning and training a LoRA from scratch. Moreover, in full-shot settings, learned composition performs comparably to regular LoRA training with significantly fewer number of trainable parameters. Our research unveils the potential of uniform composition for enhancing transferability in low-shot settings, without introducing additional learnable parameters.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 16:20:29 UTC (3,599 KB)"

However, constructing efficient equivariant networks for general groups and domains is difficult. Recent work by Finzi et al. (2021) directly solves the equivariance constraint for arbitrary matrix groups to obtain equivariant MLPs (EMLPs). But this method does not scale well and scaling is crucial in deep learning. Here, we introduce Group Representation Networks (G-RepsNets), a lightweight equivariant network for arbitrary matrix groups with features represented using tensor polynomials. The key intuition for our design is that using tensor representations in the hidden layers of a neural network along with simple inexpensive tensor operations can lead to expressive universal equivariant networks. We find G-RepsNet to be competitive to EMLP on several tasks with group symmetries such as O(5), O(1, 3), and O(3) with scalars, vectors, and second-order tensors as data types. On image classification tasks, we find that G-RepsNet using second-order representations is competitive and often even outperforms sophisticated state-of-the-art equivariant models such as GCNNs (Cohen & Welling, 2016a) and E(2)-CNNs (Weiler & Cesa, 2019). To further illustrate the generality of our approach, we show that G-RepsNet is competitive to G-FNO (Helwig et al., 2023) and EGNN (Satorras et al., 2021) on N-body predictions and solving PDEs, respectively, while being efficient.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 16:19:49 UTC (1,389 KB)"

In particular, the prediction error of Lasso becomes much worse than computationally inefficient alternatives like Best Subset Selection. Due to a large conjectured computational-statistical tradeoff in the problem of sparse linear regression, it may be impossible to close this gap in general. In this work, we propose a natural sparse linear regression setting where strong correlations between covariates arise from unobserved latent variables. In this setting, we analyze the problem caused by strong correlations and design a surprisingly simple fix. While Lasso with standard normalization of covariates fails, there exists a heterogeneous scaling of the covariates with which Lasso will suddenly obtain strong provable guarantees for estimation. Moreover, we design a simple, efficient procedure for computing such a ""smart scaling."" The sample complexity of the resulting ""rescaled Lasso"" algorithm incurs (in the worst case) quadratic dependence on the sparsity of the underlying signal. While this dependence is not information-theoretically necessary, we give evidence that it is optimal among the class of polynomial-time algorithms, via the method of low-degree polynomials. This argument reveals a new connection between sparse linear regression and a special version of sparse PCA with a near-critical negative spike. The latter problem can be thought of as a real-valued analogue of learning a sparse parity. Using it, we also establish the first computational-statistical gap for the closely related problem of learning a Gaussian Graphical Model.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 16:16:38 UTC (285 KB)"

"50","Faithful Temporal Question Answering over Heterogeneous Sources","Zhen Jia, Philipp Christmann, Gerhard Weikum","Information Retrieval (cs.IR)","Temporal question answering (QA) involves time constraints, with phrases such as ""... in 2019"" or ""... before COVID"". In the former, time is an explicit condition, in the latter it is implicit. State-of-the-art methods have limitations along three dimensions. First, with neural inference, time constraints are merely soft-matched, giving room to invalid or inexplicable answers. Second, questions with implicit time are poorly supported. Third, answers come from a single source: either a knowledge base (KB) or a text corpus. We propose a temporal QA system that addresses these shortcomings. First, it enforces temporal constraints for faithful answering with tangible evidence. Second, it properly handles implicit questions. Third, it operates over heterogeneous sources, covering KB, text and web tables in a unified manner. The method has three stages: (i) understanding the question and its temporal conditions, (ii) retrieving evidence from all sources, and (iii) faithfully answering the question. As implicit questions are sparse in prior benchmarks, we introduce a principled method for generating diverse questions. Experiments show superior performance over a suite of baselines.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 16:03:17 UTC (3,944 KB)"
"51","Distributionally Robust Off-Dynamics Reinforcement Learning: Provable Efficiency with Linear Function Approximation","Zhishuai Liu, Pan Xu","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","We study off-dynamics Reinforcement Learning (RL), where the policy is trained on a source domain and deployed to a distinct target domain. We aim to solve this problem via online distributionally robust Markov decision processes (DRMDPs), where the learning algorithm actively interacts with the source domain while seeking the optimal performance under the worst possible dynamics that is within an uncertainty set of the source domain's transition kernel. We provide the first study on online DRMDPs with function approximation for off-dynamics RL. We find that DRMDPs' dual formulation can induce nonlinearity, even when the nominal transition kernel is linear, leading to error propagation. By designing a $d$-rectangular uncertainty set using the total variation distance, we remove this additional nonlinearity and bypass the error propagation. We then introduce DR-LSVI-UCB, the first provably efficient online DRMDP algorithm for off-dynamics RL with function approximation, and establish a polynomial suboptimality bound that is independent of the state and action space sizes. Our work makes the first step towards a deeper understanding of the provable efficiency of online DRMDPs with linear function approximation. Finally, we substantiate the performance and robustness of DR-LSVI-UCB through different numerical experiments.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 16:01:44 UTC (4,431 KB)"

This research, bridging computer science and urban studies, addresses the challenge of integrating these fields with their distinct focuses. Traditional urban studies methods, like the gravity and radiation models, often underperform in complex scenarios due to their limited handling of multiple variables and reliance on overly simplistic and unrealistic assumptions, such as spatial isotropy. While deep learning models offer improved accuracy, their black-box nature poses a trade-off between performance and explainability -- both vital for analyzing complex societal phenomena like commuting flows. To address this, we introduce TransFlower, an explainable, transformer-based model employing flow-to-flow attention to predict urban commuting patterns. It features a geospatial encoder with an anisotropy-aware relative location encoder for nuanced flow representation. Following this, the transformer-based flow predictor enhances this by leveraging attention mechanisms to efficiently capture flow interactions.

It is well known that the IRL problem is fundamentally ill-posed, i.e., many reward functions can explain the demonstrations. For this reason, IRL has been recently reframed in terms of estimating the feasible reward set, thus, postponing the selection of a single reward. However, so far, the available formulations and algorithmic solutions have been proposed and analyzed mainly for the online setting, where the learner can interact with the environment and query the expert at will. This is clearly unrealistic in most practical applications, where the availability of an offline dataset is a much more common scenario. In this paper, we introduce a novel notion of feasible reward set capturing the opportunities and limitations of the offline setting and we analyze the complexity of its estimation. This requires the introduction an original learning framework that copes with the intrinsic difficulty of the setting, for which the data coverage is not under control. Then, we propose two computationally and statistically efficient algorithms, IRLO and PIRLO, for addressing the problem. In particular, the latter adopts a specific form of pessimism to enforce the novel desirable property of inclusion monotonicity of the delivered feasible set. With this work, we aim to provide a panorama of the challenges of the offline IRL problem and how they can be fruitfully addressed.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 15:49:46 UTC (123 KB)"

Our work builds off this past literature, demonstrating that self-repair exists on a variety of models families and sizes when ablating individual attention heads on the full training distribution. We further show that on the full training distribution self-repair is imperfect, as the original direct effect of the head is not fully restored, and noisy, since the degree of self-repair varies significantly across different prompts (sometimes overcorrecting beyond the original effect). We highlight two different mechanisms that contribute to self-repair, including changes in the final LayerNorm scaling factor (which can repair up to 30% of the direct effect) and sparse sets of neurons implementing Anti-Erasure. We additionally discuss the implications of these results for interpretability practitioners and close with a more speculative discussion on the mystery of why self-repair occurs in these models at all, highlighting evidence for the Iterative Inference hypothesis in language models, a framework that predicts self-repair.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 15:42:12 UTC (5,231 KB)"

To improve on this situation, next-generation authentication mechanisms, based on behavioral biometric factors such as eye movement and brainwave have emerged. However, their usability remains relatively under-explored. To fill this gap, we conducted an empirical user study (n=32 participants) to evaluate three brain-based and three eye-based authentication mechanisms, using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Our findings show good overall usability according to the System Usability Scale for both categories of mechanisms, with average SUS scores in the range of 78.6-79.6 and the best mechanisms rated with an ""excellent"" score. Participants particularly identified brainwave authentication as more secure yet more privacy-invasive and effort-intensive compared to eye movement authentication. However, the significant number of neutral responses indicates participants' need for more detailed information about the security and privacy implications of these authentication methods. Building on the collected evidence, we identify three key areas for improvement: privacy, authentication interface design, and verification time. We offer recommendations for designers and developers to improve the usability and security of next-generation authentication mechanisms.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 15:34:43 UTC (8,403 KB)"

Most of the existing methods deliver best results by encouraging standard closed-set models to produce low-confidence predictions in negative training data. However, that approach conflates prediction uncertainty with recognition of the negative class. We therefore reconsider direct prediction of K+1 logits that correspond to K groundtruth classes and one outlier class. This setup allows us to formulate a novel anomaly score as an ensemble of in-distribution uncertainty and the posterior of the outlier class which we term negative objectness. Now outliers can be independently detected due to i) high prediction uncertainty or ii) similarity with negative data. We embed our method into a dense prediction architecture with mask-level recognition over K+2 classes. The training procedure encourages the novel K+2-th class to learn negative objectness at pasted negative instances. Our models outperform the current state-of-the art on standard benchmarks for image-wide and pixel-level outlier detection with and without training on real negative data.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 15:19:37 UTC (13,520 KB)"

We leverage the synergy of these modules to harness the significant potential of syntactic and semantic information in ASTE tasks.

Tasks are expressed in natural language (NL), requiring the robots to apply their capabilities (e.g., mobility, manipulation, and sensing) at various locations and semantic objects. Several recent works have addressed similar planning problems by leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to design effective multi-robot plans. However, these approaches lack mission performance and safety guarantees. To address this challenge, we introduce a new decentralized LLM-based planner that is capable of achieving high mission success rates. This is accomplished by leveraging conformal prediction (CP), a distribution-free uncertainty quantification tool in black-box models. CP allows the proposed multi-robot planner to reason about its inherent uncertainty in a decentralized fashion, enabling robots to make individual decisions when they are sufficiently certain and seek help otherwise. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that the proposed planner can achieve user-specified task success rates while minimizing the overall number of help requests. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on multi-robot home service applications. We also show through comparative experiments, that our method outperforms recent centralized and decentralized multi-robot LLM-based planners in terms of in terms of its ability to design correct plans. The advantage of our algorithm over baselines becomes more pronounced with increasing mission complexity and robot team size.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 15:02:44 UTC (25,850 KB)"

To complement the future performance increases of software running on central processing units (CPUs), explorations of coprocessor usage in data processing hold great potential and interest. Coprocessors are a class of computer processors that supplement CPUs, often improving the execution of certain functions due to architectural design choices. We explore the approach of Services for Optimized Network Inference on Coprocessors (SONIC) and study the deployment of this as-a-service approach in large-scale data processing. In the studies, we take a data processing workflow of the CMS experiment and run the main workflow on CPUs, while offloading several machine learning (ML) inference tasks onto either remote or local coprocessors, specifically graphics processing units (GPUs). With experiments performed at Google Cloud, the Purdue Tier-2 computing center, and combinations of the two, we demonstrate the acceleration of these ML algorithms individually on coprocessors and the corresponding throughput improvement for the entire workflow. This approach can be easily generalized to different types of coprocessors and deployed on local CPUs without decreasing the throughput performance.

In semi-supervised learning settings, a labeled data set with both outcomes and covariates and an unlabeled data set with covariates only are collected. We consider an inference problem in semi-supervised settings where the outcome in the labeled data is binary and the labeled data is collected by case-control sampling. Case-control sampling is an effective sampling scheme for alleviating imbalance structure in binary data. Under the logistic model assumption, case-control data can still provide consistent estimator for the slope parameter of the regression model. However, the intercept parameter is not identifiable. Consequently, the marginal case proportion cannot be estimated from case-control data. We find out that with the availability of the unlabeled data, the intercept parameter can be identified in semi-supervised learning setting. We construct the likelihood function of the observed labeled and unlabeled data and obtain the maximum likelihood estimator via an iterative algorithm. The proposed estimator is shown to be consistent, asymptotically normal, and semiparametrically efficient. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to show the finite sample performance of the proposed method. The results imply that the unlabeled data not only helps to identify the intercept but also improves the estimation efficiency of the slope parameter. Meanwhile, the marginal case proportion can be estimated accurately by the proposed method.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 14:55:58 UTC (22 KB)"

Moreover, code publication is often seen as an important contributor to reproducible research, we suggest that in some cases the opposite may be true. A new perspective on this topic stems from the accelerating trend that in some branches of research only implemented models are used, e.g., in artificial intelligence (AI).

An off-road environment is an unstructured environment comprising a combination of traversable and non-traversable spaces, which presents a challenge for estimating traversability. This study highlights three primary factors that affect a robot's traversability in an off-road environment: surface slope, semantic information, and robot platform. We present two strategies for estimating traversability, using a guide filter network (GFN) and footprint supervision module (FSM). The first strategy involves building a novel GFN using a newly designed guide filter layer. The GFN interprets the surface and semantic information from the input data and integrates them to extract features optimized for traversability estimation. The second strategy involves developing an FSM, which is a self-supervision module that utilizes the path traversed by the robot in pre-driving, also known as a footprint. This enables the prediction of traversability that reflects the characteristics of the robot platform. Based on these two strategies, the proposed method overcomes the limitations of existing methods, which require laborious human supervision and lack scalability. Extensive experiments in diverse conditions, including automobiles and unmanned ground vehicles, herbfields, woodlands, and farmlands, demonstrate that the proposed method is compatible for various robot platforms and adaptable to a range of terrains.

Machine learning classifiers for species identification are increasingly being used to process the vast amount of audio generated by bioacoustic surveys, expediting analysis and increasing the utility of PAM as a management tool. In common practice, a threshold is applied to classifier output scores, and scores above the threshold are aggregated into a detection count. The choice of threshold produces biased counts of vocalizations, which are subject to false positive/negative rates that may vary across subsets of the dataset. In this work, we advocate for directly estimating call density: The proportion of detection windows containing the target vocalization, regardless of classifier score. Our approach targets a desirable ecological estimator and provides a more rigorous grounding for identifying the core problems caused by distribution shifts -- when the defining characteristics of the data distribution change -- and designing strategies to mitigate them. We propose a validation scheme for estimating call density in a body of data and obtain, through Bayesian reasoning, probability distributions of confidence scores for both the positive and negative classes. We use these distributions to predict site-level densities, which may be subject to distribution shifts. We test our proposed methods on a real-world study of Hawaiian birds and provide simulation results leveraging existing fully annotated datasets, demonstrating robustness to variations in call density and classifier model quality.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 14:52:44 UTC (297 KB)"

Each of these is obtained by a localized illumination of the object, which is shifted after each illumination to cover its whole domain. As in the resulting measurements the phase information is lost, ptychography gives rise to solving a phase retrieval problem. In this work, we consider ptychographic measurements corrupted with background noise, a type of additive noise that is independent of the shift, i.e., it is the same for all diffraction patterns. Two algorithms are provided, for arbitrary objects and for so-called phase objects that do not absorb the light but only scatter it. For the second type, a uniqueness of reconstruction is established for almost every object. Our approach is based on the Wigner Distribution Deconvolution, which lifts the object to a higher-dimensional matrix space where the recovery can be reformulated as a linear problem. Background noise only affects a few equations of the linear system that are therefore discarded. The lost information is then restored using redundancy in the higher-dimensional space.

In this problem, the input is an edge-weighted (directed or undirected) $n$-vertex graph $G$ along with $k$ terminal pairs $(s_1,t_1),(s_2,t_2),\ldots,(s_k,t_k)$. The task is to connect as many terminal pairs as possible by pairwise vertex-disjoint paths such that each path is a shortest path between the respective terminals. Our work is anchored in the recent breakthrough by Lochet [SODA '21], which demonstrates the polynomial-time solvability of the problem for a fixed value of $k$. Lochet's result implies the existence of a polynomial-time $ck$-approximation for Maximum Vertex-Disjoint Shortest Paths, where $c \leq 1$ is a constant. Our first result suggests that this approximation algorithm is, in a sense, the best we can hope for. More precisely, assuming the gap-ETH, we exclude the existence of an $o(k)$-approximations within $f(k) \cdot $poly($n$) time for any function $f$ that only depends on $k$. Our second result demonstrates the infeasibility of achieving an approximation ratio of $n^{\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon}$ in polynomial time, unless P = NP. It is not difficult to show that a greedy algorithm selecting a path with the minimum number of arcs results in a $\lceil\sqrt{\ell}\rceil$-approximation, where $\ell$ is the number of edges in all the paths of an optimal solution. Since $\ell \leq n$, this underscores the tightness of the $n^{\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon}$-inapproximability bound. Additionally, we establish that Maximum Vertex-Disjoint Shortest Paths is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by $\ell$ but does not admit a polynomial kernel. Our hardness results hold for undirected graphs with unit weights, while our positive results extend to scenarios where the input graph is directed and features arbitrary (non-negative) edge weights.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 14:31:52 UTC (25 KB)"

A common approach is to place a Gaussian process prior on the unknown functions and allow evaluations only in regions that are safe with high probability. Most current methods rely on a discretization of the domain and cannot be directly extended to the continuous case. Moreover, the way in which they exploit regularity assumptions about the constraint introduces an additional critical hyperparameter. In this paper, we propose an information-theoretic safe exploration criterion that directly exploits the GP posterior to identify the most informative safe parameters to evaluate. The combination of this exploration criterion with a well known Bayesian optimization acquisition function yields a novel safe Bayesian optimization selection criterion. Our approach is naturally applicable to continuous domains and does not require additional explicit hyperparameters. We theoretically analyze the method and show that we do not violate the safety constraint with high probability and that we learn about the value of the safe optimum up to arbitrary precision.

"75","Iteration and Stochastic First-order Oracle Complexities of Stochastic Gradient Descent using Constant and Decaying Learning Rates","Kento Imaizumi, Hideaki Iiduka","Machine Learning (stat.ML)","The performance of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which is the simplest first-order optimizer for training deep neural networks, depends on not only the learning rate but also the batch size. They both affect the number of iterations and the stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity needed for training. In particular, the previous numerical results indicated that, for SGD using a constant learning rate, the number of iterations needed for training decreases when the batch size increases, and the SFO complexity needed for training is minimized at a critical batch size and that it increases once the batch size exceeds that size. Here, we study the relationship between batch size and the iteration and SFO complexities needed for nonconvex optimization in deep learning with SGD using constant or decaying learning rates and show that SGD using the critical batch size minimizes the SFO complexity. We also provide numerical comparisons of SGD with the existing first-order optimizers and show the usefulness of SGD using a critical batch size. Moreover, we show that measured critical batch sizes are close to the sizes estimated from our theoretical results.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 14:24:45 UTC (135 KB)"

Martinez Lastra","Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)","Photo-realistic avatar is a modern term referring to the digital asset that represents a human in computer graphic advance systems such as video games and simulation tools. These avatars utilize the advances in graphic technologies on both software and hardware aspects. While photorealistic avatars are increasingly used in industrial simulations, representing human factors such as human workers internal states, remains a challenge. This article addresses this issue by introducing the concept of MetaStates which are the digitization and representation of the psychophysiological states of a human worker in the digital world. The MetaStates influence the physical representation and performance of a digital human worker while performing a task. To demonstrate this concept the study presents a development of a photorealistic avatar which is integrated into a simulated environment and enhanced with a multi-level graphical representation of different psychophysiological states. This approach represents a major step forward in the use of digital humans for industrial simulations, allowing companies to better leverage the benefits of the Industrial Metaverse in their daily operations and simulations while keeping human workers at the center of the system.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 14:21:11 UTC (738 KB)"
"78","Ranking Entities along Conceptual Space Dimensions with LLMs: An Analysis of Fine-Tuning Strategies","Nitesh Kumar, Usashi Chatterjee, Steven Schockaert","Computation and Language (cs.CL)","Conceptual spaces represent entities in terms of their primitive semantic features. Such representations are highly valuable but they are notoriously difficult to learn, especially when it comes to modelling perceptual and subjective features. Distilling conceptual spaces from Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently emerged as a promising strategy. However, existing work has been limited to probing pre-trained LLMs using relatively simple zero-shot strategies. We focus in particular on the task of ranking entities according to a given conceptual space dimension. Unfortunately, we cannot directly fine-tune LLMs on this task, because ground truth rankings for conceptual space dimensions are rare. We therefore use more readily available features as training data and analyse whether the ranking capabilities of the resulting models transfer to perceptual and subjective features. We find that this is indeed the case, to some extent, but having perceptual and subjective features in the training data seems essential for achieving the best results. We furthermore find that pointwise ranking strategies are competitive against pairwise approaches, in defiance of common wisdom.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 14:17:01 UTC (7,877 KB)"

These factors also limit the performance of the well-known low-rank representation (LRR) models in terms of robustness on the separation of background and target features and the reliance on manual parameter selection. To this end, we build a new set of HAD benchmark datasets for improving the robustness of the HAD algorithm in complex scenarios, AIR-HAD for short. Accordingly, we propose a generalized and interpretable HAD network by deeply unfolding a dictionary-learnable LLR model, named LRR-Net$^+$, which is capable of spectrally decoupling the background structure and object properties in a more generalized fashion and eliminating the bias introduced by vital interference targets concurrently. In addition, LRR-Net$^+$ integrates the solution process of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) optimizer with the deep network, guiding its search process and imparting a level of interpretability to parameter optimization. Additionally, the integration of physical models with DL techniques eliminates the need for manual parameter tuning. The manually tuned parameters are seamlessly transformed into trainable parameters for deep neural networks, facilitating a more efficient and automated optimization process. Extensive experiments conducted on the AIR-HAD dataset show the superiority of our LRR-Net$^+$ in terms of detection performance and generalization ability, compared to top-performing rivals. Furthermore, the compilable codes and our AIR-HAD benchmark datasets in this paper will be made available freely and openly at \url{this https URL}.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 14:15:58 UTC (16,795 KB)"

These methods encounter challenges related to slow convergence and diminished accuracy, especially in ill-conditioned scenarios, hindering their application in future MIMO networks such as extra-large aperture array (ELAA). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel matrix regularization method termed symmetric rank-$1$ regularization (SR-$1$R). The proposed method functions by augmenting the channel matrix with a symmetric rank-$1$ matrix, with the primary goal of minimizing the condition number of the resultant regularized matrix. This significantly improves the matrix condition, enabling fast and accurate iterative inversion of the regularized matrix. Then, the inverse of the original channel matrix is obtained by applying the Sherman-Morrison transform on the outcome of iterative inversions. Our eigenvalue analysis unveils the best channel condition that can be achieved by an optimized SR-$1$R matrix. Moreover, a power iteration-assisted (PIA) approach is proposed to find the optimum SR-$1$R matrix without need of eigenvalue decomposition. The proposed approach exhibits logarithmic algorithm-depth in parallel computing for MIMO precoding. Finally, computer simulations demonstrate that SR-$1$R has the potential to reduce iterative iterations by up to $33\%$, while also significantly improve symbol error probability by approximately an order of magnitude.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 14:10:41 UTC (3,635 KB)"

This constraint greatly inhibits the range of applications that can leverage quantum computers. Moreover, as the available qubits increase, the computational complexity grows exponentially, posing additional challenges. Consequently, there is an urgent need to use qubits efficiently and mitigate both present limitations and future complexities. To address this, existing quantum applications attempt to integrate classical and quantum systems in a hybrid framework. In this study, we concentrate on quantum deep learning and introduce a collaborative classical-quantum architecture called co-TenQu. The classical component employs a tensor network for compression and feature extraction, enabling higher-dimensional data to be encoded onto logical quantum circuits with limited qubits. On the quantum side, we propose a quantum-state-fidelity-based evaluation function to iteratively train the network through a feedback loop between the two sides. co-TenQu has been implemented and evaluated with both simulators and the IBM-Q platform. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, co-TenQu enhances a classical deep neural network by up to 41.72% in a fair setting. Additionally, it outperforms other quantum-based methods by up to 1.9 times and achieves similar accuracy while utilizing 70.59% fewer qubits.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 14:09:41 UTC (16,222 KB)"

This finding further poses a general and mild ergodicity-breaking condition, encompassing the various specific solutions previously offered, thereby presenting a more universal and theoretically grounded approach to mitigating oversmoothing in diffusion-based GNNs. Additionally, we offer a probabilistic interpretation of our theory, forging a link with prior works and broadening the theoretical horizon.

One of the important questions to be answered is how to conduct credit assignment in a multi-agent system. There have been many schemes designed to conduct credit assignment by multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. Although these credit assignment schemes have been proved useful in improving the performance of multi-agent reinforcement learning, most of them are designed heuristically without a rigorous theoretic basis and therefore infeasible to understand how agents cooperate. In this thesis, we aim at investigating the foundation of credit assignment in multi-agent reinforcement learning via cooperative game theory. We first extend a game model called convex game and a payoff distribution scheme called Shapley value in cooperative game theory to Markov decision process, named as Markov convex game and Markov Shapley value respectively. We represent a global reward game as a Markov convex game under the grand coalition. As a result, Markov Shapley value can be reasonably used as a credit assignment scheme in the global reward game. Markov Shapley value possesses the following virtues: (i) efficiency; (ii) identifiability of dummy agents; (iii) reflecting the contribution and (iv) symmetry, which form the fair credit assignment. Based on Markov Shapley value, we propose three multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms called SHAQ, SQDDPG and SMFPPO. Furthermore, we extend Markov convex game to partial observability to deal with the partially observable problems, named as partially observable Markov convex game. In application, we evaluate SQDDPG and SMFPPO on the real-world problem in energy networks.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 13:43:15 UTC (58,384 KB)"

In this paper, we develop a computational framework for optimal transportation over Lie groups, with a special focus on SE2. We make several theoretical contributions (generalizable to matrix Lie groups) such as the non-optimality of group actions as transport maps, invariance and equivariance of optimal transport, and the quality of the entropic-regularized optimal transport plan using geodesic distance approximations. We develop a Sinkhorn like algorithm that can be efficiently implemented using fast and accurate distance approximations of the Lie group and GPU-friendly group convolutions. We report valuable advancements in the experiments on 1) image barycenters, 2) interpolation of planar orientation fields, and 3) Wasserstein gradient flows on SE2. We observe that our framework of lifting images to SE2 and optimal transport with left-invariant anisotropic metrics leads to equivariant transport along dominant contours and salient line structures in the image.

We propose the GPTVQ method, a new fast method for post-training vector quantization (VQ) that scales well to Large Language Models (LLMs). Our method interleaves quantization of one or more columns with updates to the remaining unquantized weights, using information from the Hessian of the per-layer output reconstruction MSE. Quantization codebooks are initialized using an efficient data-aware version of the EM algorithm. The codebooks are then updated, and further compressed by using integer quantization and SVD-based compression. GPTVQ establishes a new state-of-the art in the size vs accuracy trade-offs on a wide range of LLMs such as Llama-v2 and Mistral. Furthermore, our method is efficient: on a single H100 it takes between 3 and 11 hours to process a Llamav2-70B model, depending on quantization setting. Lastly, with on-device timings for VQ decompression on a mobile CPU we show that VQ leads to improved latency compared to using a 4-bit integer format.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 13:39:16 UTC (499 KB)"

The topics are the minimal depth representation of the sum and max operations, as well as the exploration of polytope neural networks. For the sum operation, we establish a sufficient condition on the minimal depth of the operands to find the minimal depth of the operation. In contrast, regarding the max operation, a comprehensive set of examples is presented, demonstrating that no sufficient conditions, depending solely on the depth of the operands, would imply a minimal depth for the operation. The study also examine the minimal depth relationship between convex CPWL functions. On polytope neural networks, we investigate several fundamental properties, deriving results equivalent to those of ReLU networks, such as depth inclusions and depth computation from vertices. Notably, we compute the minimal depth of simplices, which is strictly related to the minimal depth conjecture in ReLU networks.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 13:34:03 UTC (17 KB)"

Consequently, there is a theoretical and practical imperative for developing LLMs predominantly focused on Arabic linguistic elements. To address this gap, this paper proposes ArabianGPT, a series of transformer-based models within the ArabianLLM suite designed explicitly for Arabic. These models, including ArabianGPT-0.1B and ArabianGPT-0.3B, vary in size and complexity, aligning with the nuanced linguistic characteristics of Arabic. The AraNizer tokenizer, integral to these models, addresses the unique morphological aspects of Arabic script, ensuring more accurate text processing. Empirical results from fine-tuning the models on tasks like sentiment analysis and summarization demonstrate significant improvements. For sentiment analysis, the fine-tuned ArabianGPT-0.1B model achieved a remarkable accuracy of 95%, a substantial increase from the base model's 56%. Similarly, in summarization tasks, fine-tuned models showed enhanced F1 scores, indicating improved precision and recall in generating concise summaries. Comparative analysis of fine-tuned ArabianGPT models against their base versions across various benchmarks reveals nuanced differences in performance, with fine-tuning positively impacting specific tasks like question answering and summarization.

This generation process usually requires the identification of the disentangled latent representations, such as content and style, that underlie the observed data. However, it becomes more challenging when faced with a scarcity of paired data and labeling information. Existing disentangled methods crucially rely on oversimplified assumptions, such as assuming independent content and style variables, to identify the latent variables, even though such assumptions may not hold for complex data distributions. For instance, food reviews tend to involve words like tasty, whereas movie reviews commonly contain words such as thrilling for the same positive sentiment. This problem is exacerbated when data are sampled from multiple domains since the dependence between content and style may vary significantly over domains. In this work, we tackle the domain-varying dependence between the content and the style variables inherent in the counterfactual generation task. We provide identification guarantees for such latent-variable models by leveraging the relative sparsity of the influences from different latent variables.

We propose a novel tokenized representation of digital ink (online handwriting) that includes both a time-ordered sequence of strokes as text, and as image. We show that this representation yields results comparable to or better than state-of-the-art online handwriting recognizers. Wide applicability is shown through results with two different VLM families, on multiple public datasets.

Despite their potential, these models can be tricked into producing harmful or unethical content through various sophisticated methods, including 'jailbreaking' techniques and targeted manipulation. Our work zeroes in on a specific issue: to what extent LLMs can be led astray by asking them to generate responses that are instruction-centric such as a pseudocode, a program or a software snippet as opposed to vanilla text. To investigate this question, we introduce TechHazardQA, a dataset containing complex queries which should be answered in both text and instruction-centric formats (e.g., pseudocodes), aimed at identifying triggers for unethical responses. We query a series of LLMs -- Llama-2-13b, Llama-2-7b, Mistral-V2 and Mistral 8X7B -- and ask them to generate both text and instruction-centric responses. For evaluation we report the harmfulness score metric as well as judgements from GPT-4 and humans. Overall, we observe that asking LLMs to produce instruction-centric responses enhances the unethical response generation by ~2-38% across the models. As an additional objective, we investigate the impact of model editing using the ROME technique, which further increases the propensity for generating undesirable content. In particular, asking edited LLMs to generate instruction-centric responses further increases the unethical response generation by ~3-16% across the different models.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 13:03:12 UTC (790 KB)"

Inspired by the continuous state space models (SSMs) with multi-input and multi-output in control theory, we propose a new neural network called Linear Dynamics-embedded Neural Network (LDNN). SSMs' continuous, discrete, and convolutional properties enable LDNN to have few parameters, flexible inference, and efficient training in long-sequence tasks. Two efficient strategies, diagonalization and $'\text{Disentanglement then Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)}'$, are developed to reduce the time complexity of convolution from $O(LNH\max\{L, N\})$ to $O(LN\max \{H, \log L\})$. We further improve LDNN through bidirectional noncausal and multi-head settings to accommodate a broader range of applications. Extensive experiments on the Long Range Arena (LRA) demonstrate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of LDNN.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 12:36:31 UTC (182 KB)"

However, a notable challenge in ABSA lies in precisely determining the aspects' boundaries (start and end indices), especially for long ones, due to users' colloquial expressions. We propose DiffusionABSA, a novel diffusion model tailored for ABSA, which extracts the aspects progressively step by step. Particularly, DiffusionABSA gradually adds noise to the aspect terms in the training process, subsequently learning a denoising process that progressively restores these terms in a reverse manner. To estimate the boundaries, we design a denoising neural network enhanced by a syntax-aware temporal attention mechanism to chronologically capture the interplay between aspects and surrounding text. Empirical evaluations conducted on eight benchmark datasets underscore the compelling advantages offered by DiffusionABSA when compared against robust baseline models.

In GM in particular, the use of reverse-time diffusion processes depending on the log-densities of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck forward processes are a popular sampling tool. In Berner et al. [2022] the authors point out that these log-densities can be obtained by solution of a \textit{Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman} (HJB) equation known from stochastic optimal control. While this HJB equation is usually treated with indirect methods such as policy iteration and unsupervised training of black-box architectures like Neural Networks, we propose instead to solve the HJB equation by direct time integration, using compressed polynomials represented in the Tensor Train (TT) format for spatial discretization. Crucially, this method is sample-free, agnostic to normalization constants and can avoid the curse of dimensionality due to the TT compression. We provide a complete derivation of the HJB equation's action on Tensor Train polynomials and demonstrate the performance of the proposed time-step-, rank- and degree-adaptive integration method on a nonlinear sampling task in 20 dimensions.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 12:30:20 UTC (1,986 KB)"

In this work, we tackle this problem by applying domain knowledge from the dynamical system to the framework design of deep learning models. An observer theory-guided deep learning architecture, called Spatiotemporal Observer, is designed for predictive learning of high dimensional data. The characteristics of the proposed framework are twofold: firstly, it provides the generalization error bound and convergence guarantee for spatiotemporal prediction; secondly, dynamical regularization is introduced to enable the model to learn system dynamics better during training. Further experimental results show that this framework could capture the spatiotemporal dynamics and make accurate predictions in both one-step-ahead and multi-step-ahead forecasting scenarios.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 12:28:31 UTC (717 KB)"

"106","Dimension Independent Disentanglers from Unentanglement and Applications","Fernando G. Jeronimo, Pei Wu","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","Quantum entanglement is a key enabling ingredient in diverse applications. However, the presence of unwanted adversarial entanglement also poses challenges in many applications. In this paper, we explore methods to ""break"" quantum entanglement. Specifically, we construct a dimension-independent k-partite disentangler (like) channel from bipartite unentangled input. We show: For every $d,\ell\ge k$, there is an efficient channel $\Lambda: \mathbb{C}^{d\ell} \otimes \mathbb{C}^{d\ell} \to \mathbb{C}^{dk}$ such that for every bipartite separable state $\rho_1\otimes \rho_2$, the output $\Lambda(\rho_1\otimes\rho_2)$ is close to a k-partite separable state. Concretely, for some distribution $\mu$ on states from $\mathbb{C}^d$, $$ \left\|\Lambda(\rho_1 \otimes \rho_2) - \int | \psi \rangle \langle \psi |^{\otimes k} d\mu(\psi)\right\|_1 \le \tilde O \left(\left(\frac{k^{3}}{\ell}\right)^{1/4}\right). $$ Moreover, $\Lambda(| \psi \rangle \langle \psi |^{\otimes \ell}\otimes | \psi \rangle \langle \psi |^{\otimes \ell}) = | \psi \rangle \langle \psi |^{\otimes k}$. Without the bipartite unentanglement assumption, the above bound is conjectured to be impossible. Leveraging our disentanglers, we show that unentangled quantum proofs of almost general real amplitudes capture NEXP, greatly relaxing the nonnegative amplitudes assumption in the recent work of QMA^+(2)=NEXP. Specifically, our findings show that to capture NEXP, it suffices to have unentangled proofs of the form $| \psi \rangle = \sqrt{a} | \psi_+ \rangle + \sqrt{1-a} | \psi_- \rangle$ where $| \psi_+ \rangle$ has non-negative amplitudes, $| \psi_- \rangle$ only has negative amplitudes and $| a-(1-a) | \ge 1/poly(n)$ with $a \in [0,1]$. Additionally, we present a protocol achieving an almost largest possible gap before obtaining QMA^R(k)=NEXP$, namely, a 1/poly(n) additive improvement to the gap results in this equality.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 12:22:03 UTC (125 KB)"

This is facilitated by new hardware extensions, like AMD's SEV Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP), which can run a whole virtual machine with confidentiality and integrity protection against a potentially malicious hypervisor owned by an untrusted cloud provider. However, the assurance of such protection to either the service providers deploying sensitive workloads or the end-users passing sensitive data to services requires sending proof to the interested parties. Service providers can retrieve such proof by performing remote attestation while end-users have typically no means to acquire this proof or validate its correctness and therefore have to rely on the trustworthiness of the service providers. In this paper, we present Revelio, an approach that features two main contributions: i) it allows confidential virtual machine (VM)-based workloads to be designed and deployed in a way that disallows any tampering even by the service providers and ii) it empowers users to easily validate their integrity. In particular, we focus on web-facing workloads, protect them leveraging SEV-SNP, and enable end-users to remotely attest them seamlessly each time a new web session is established. To highlight the benefits of Revelio, we discuss how a standalone stateful VM that hosts an open-source collaboration office suite can be secured and present a replicated protocol proxy that enables commodity users to securely access the Internet Computer, a decentralized blockchain infrastructure.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 11:54:07 UTC (1,242 KB)"

Despite the advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which offer leading-edge performance, their applicability in large-scale, varied, and ambiguous retrieval scenarios is constrained by significant computational demands and the generation of injective embeddings. This paper introduces the Text2Pic Swift framework, tailored for efficient and robust retrieval of images corresponding to extensive textual descriptions in sizable datasets. The framework employs a two-tier approach: the initial Entity-based Ranking (ER) stage addresses the ambiguity inherent in lengthy text queries through a multiple-queries-to-multiple-targets strategy, effectively narrowing down potential candidates for subsequent analysis. Following this, the Summary-based Re-ranking (SR) stage further refines these selections based on concise query summaries. Additionally, we present a novel Decoupling-BEiT-3 encoder, specifically designed to tackle the challenges of ambiguous queries and to facilitate both stages of the retrieval process, thereby significantly improving computational efficiency via vector-based similarity assessments. Our evaluation, conducted on the AToMiC dataset, demonstrates that Text2Pic Swift outperforms current MLLMs by achieving up to an 11.06% increase in Recall@1000, alongside reductions in training and retrieval durations by 68.75% and 99.79%, respectively.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 11:47:16 UTC (3,555 KB)"

To address these issues, we propose a novel camera-based 3D detection framework for VIC3D task, Enhanced Multi-scale Image Feature Fusion (EMIFF).

In this paper, we present a Smoothed Graph Contrastive Learning model (SGCL), which leverages the geometric structure of augmented graphs to inject proximity information associated with positive/negative pairs in the contrastive loss, thus significantly regularizing the learning process. The proposed SGCL adjusts the penalties associated with node pairs in the contrastive loss by incorporating three distinct smoothing techniques that result in proximity aware positives and negatives. To enhance scalability for large-scale graphs, the proposed framework incorporates a graph batch-generating strategy that partitions the given graphs into multiple subgraphs, facilitating efficient training in separate batches.

In light of the vulnerability of deep learning detectors to subtle input file modifications, we propose a practical defense against adversarial malware examples inspired by (de)randomized smoothing. In this work, we reduce the chances of sampling adversarial content injected by malware authors by selecting correlated subsets of bytes, rather than using Gaussian noise to randomize inputs like in the Computer Vision (CV) domain. During training, our ablation-based smoothing scheme trains a base classifier to make classifications on a subset of contiguous bytes or chunk of bytes. At test time, a large number of chunks are then classified by a base classifier and the consensus among these classifications is then reported as the final prediction. We propose two strategies to determine the location of the chunks used for classification: (1) randomly selecting the locations of the chunks and (2) selecting contiguous adjacent chunks. To showcase the effectiveness of our approach, we have trained two classifiers with our chunk-based ablation schemes on the BODMAS dataset. Our findings reveal that the chunk-based smoothing classifiers exhibit greater resilience against adversarial malware examples generated with state-of-the-are evasion attacks, outperforming a non-smoothed classifier and a randomized smoothing-based classifier by a great margin.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 11:30:12 UTC (3,228 KB)"

While the goal is to recover the true causal structure, robust imputation requires considering the dependencies or preferably causal relations among variables. Merely filling in missing values with existing imputation methods and subsequently applying structure learning on the complete data is empirical shown to be sub-optimal. To this end, we propose in this paper a score-based algorithm, based on optimal transport, for learning causal structure from missing data. This optimal transport viewpoint diverges from existing score-based approaches that are dominantly based on EM. We project structure learning as a density fitting problem, where the goal is to find the causal model that induces a distribution of minimum Wasserstein distance with the distribution over the observed data. Through extensive simulations and real-data experiments, our framework is shown to recover the true causal graphs more effectively than the baselines in various simulations and real-data experiments. Empirical evidences also demonstrate the superior scalability of our approach, along with the flexibility to incorporate any off-the-shelf causal discovery methods for complete data.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 10:49:04 UTC (345 KB)"

Moreover, approaching performance limitations of core decomposition from two different directions within a parallel synchronization structure has not been thoroughly explored.

To address this issue without the need for expensive manual data creation, we use few-shot prompting with Llama-2-70B to enhance the MultiWOZ dataset with user backstories, a typical example of chitchat interference in TODs. We assess the impact of this addition by testing two models: one trained solely on TODs and another trained on TODs with a preliminary chitchat interaction. Our analysis reveals that our enriched dataset poses a significant challenge to these systems. Moreover, we demonstrate that our dataset can be effectively used for training purposes, enabling a system to consistently acknowledge the user's backstory while also successfully moving the task forward in the same turn, as confirmed by human evaluation. These findings highlight the benefits of generating novel chitchat-TOD scenarios to test TOD systems more thoroughly and improve their resilience to natural user interferences.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 10:27:42 UTC (242 KB)"
"128","A Bargaining-based Approach for Feature Trading in Vertical Federated Learning","Yue Cui, Liuyi Yao, Zitao Li, Yaliang Li, Bolin Ding, Xiaofang Zhou","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) has emerged as a popular machine learning paradigm, enabling model training across the data and the task parties with different features about the same user set while preserving data privacy. In production environment, VFL usually involves one task party and one data party. Fair and economically efficient feature trading is crucial to the commercialization of VFL, where the task party is considered as the data consumer who buys the data party's features. However, current VFL feature trading practices often price the data party's data as a whole and assume transactions occur prior to the performing VFL. Neglecting the performance gains resulting from traded features may lead to underpayment and overpayment issues. In this study, we propose a bargaining-based feature trading approach in VFL to encourage economically efficient transactions. Our model incorporates performance gain-based pricing, taking into account the revenue-based optimization objectives of both parties. We analyze the proposed bargaining model under perfect and imperfect performance information settings, proving the existence of an equilibrium that optimizes the parties' objectives. Moreover, we develop performance gain estimation-based bargaining strategies for imperfect performance information scenarios and discuss potential security issues and solutions. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bargaining model.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 10:21:07 UTC (425 KB)"

Thus, Transfer Learning models often prove themselves suboptimal for these tasks, even after manual finetuning. The development of architectures from scratch is oftentimes unfeasible due to the vastness of the hyperparameter space and a shortage of time, computational resources and Deep Learning experts in most biomedical research laboratories. An alternative to manually defining the models is the use of Neuroevolution, which employs metaheuristic techniques to optimize Deep Learning architectures. However, many algorithms proposed in the neuroevolutive literature are either too unreliable or limited to a small, predefined region of the hyperparameter space. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose the Chimera Algorithm, a novel, hybrid neuroevolutive algorithm that integrates the Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm with Evolutionary Computation tools to generate models from scratch, as well as to refine a given previous architecture to better fit the task at hand. The Chimera Algorithm has been validated with two datasets of natural and medical images, producing models that surpassed the performance of those coming from Transfer Learning.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 10:21:03 UTC (961 KB)"

Underactuated aerial vehicles are widely employed in aerial manipulation due to their widespread availability and relatively low cost. Industrial infrastructures often consist of diverse oriented work surfaces. When interacting with such surfaces, the coupled gravity compensation and interaction force generation of underactuated aerial vehicles can present the potential challenge of near-saturation operations. The blind utilization of these platforms for such tasks can lead to instability and accidents, creating unsafe operating conditions and potentially damaging the platform. In order to ensure safe pushing on these surfaces while managing platform saturation, this work establishes a safety assessment process. This process involves the prediction of the saturation level of each actuator during pushing across variable surface orientations. Furthermore, the assessment results are used to plan and execute physical experiments, ensuring safe operations and preventing platform damage.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 10:13:08 UTC (7,611 KB)"

Therefore, measuring the averaged performance over all examples in held-out test data is inadequate. Instead, we must identify specific model weaknesses and be informed when it is more likely to fail. A recent proposal in this direction is HateCheck, a suite for testing fine-grained model functionalities on synthesized data generated using templates of the kind ""You are just a [slur] to me."" However, despite enabling more detailed diagnostic insights, the HateCheck test cases are often generic and have simplistic sentence structures that do not match the real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose GPT-HateCheck, a framework to generate more diverse and realistic functional tests from scratch by instructing large language models (LLMs). We employ an additional natural language inference (NLI) model to verify the generations. Crowd-sourced annotation demonstrates that the generated test cases are of high quality. Using the new functional tests, we can uncover model weaknesses that would be overlooked using the original HateCheck dataset.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 10:02:01 UTC (1,586 KB)"

We use a font dataset with annotation about font impressions and a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework for this task. However, impressions attached to individual fonts are often missing and noisy because of the subjective characteristic of font impression annotation. To realize stable impression estimation even with such a dataset, we propose an exemplar-based impression estimation approach, which relies on a strategy of ensembling impressions of exemplar fonts that are similar to the input image. In addition, we train CNN with synthetic font images that mimic scanned word images so that CNN estimates impressions of font images in the wild. We evaluate the basic performance of the proposed estimation method quantitatively and qualitatively. Then, we conduct a correlation analysis between book genres and font impressions on real book cover images; it is important to note that this analysis is only possible with our impression estimation method. The analysis reveals various trends in the correlation between them - this fact supports a hypothesis that book cover designers carefully choose a font for a book cover considering the impression given by the font.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 10:00:25 UTC (1,325 KB)"

Source extraction, characterization, and classification are the major stages involved in this process. In this work we focus on the classification of compact radio sources in the Galactic plane using both radio and infrared images as inputs. To this aim, we produced a curated dataset of ~20,000 images of compact sources of different astronomical classes, obtained from past radio and infrared surveys, and novel radio data from pilot surveys carried out with the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP). Radio spectral index information was also obtained for a subset of the data. We then trained two different classifiers on the produced dataset. The first model uses gradient-boosted decision trees and is trained on a set of pre-computed features derived from the data, which include radio-infrared colour indices and the radio spectral index. The second model is trained directly on multi-channel images, employing convolutional neural networks. Using a completely supervised procedure, we obtained a high classification accuracy (F1-score>90%) for separating Galactic objects from the extragalactic background. Individual class discrimination performances, ranging from 60% to 75%, increased by 10% when adding far-infrared and spectral index information, with extragalactic objects, PNe and HII regions identified with higher accuracies.

Due to catastrophic forgetting, neural networks inevitably forget the knowledge of old tasks after learning new ones. In visual classification scenario, a common practice of alleviating the forgetting is to constrain the backbone. However, the impact of classifiers is underestimated. In this paper, we analyze the variation of model predictions in sequential binary classification tasks and find that the norm of the equivalent one-class classifiers significantly affects the forgetting level. Based on this conclusion, we propose a two-stage continual learning algorithm named Fixed Random Classifier Rearrangement (FRCR). In first stage, FRCR replaces the learnable classifiers with fixed random classifiers, constraining the norm of the equivalent one-class classifiers without affecting the performance of the network. In second stage, FRCR rearranges the entries of new classifiers to implicitly reduce the drift of old latent representations. The experimental results on multiple datasets show that FRCR significantly mitigates the model forgetting; subsequent experimental analyses further validate the effectiveness of the algorithm.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 09:43:58 UTC (22,618 KB)"

In multi-tenant LLMs serving scenarios, the compute and memory operation cost of self-attention can be optimized by using the probability that multiple LLM requests have shared system prompts in prefixes. In this paper, we introduce ChunkAttention, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache. This is achieved by breaking monolithic key/value tensors into smaller chunks and structuring them into the auxiliary prefix tree. Consequently, on top of the prefix-tree based KV cache, we design an efficient self-attention kernel, where a two-phase partition algorithm is implemented to improve the data locality during self-attention computation in the presence of shared system prompts. Experiments show that ChunkAttention can speed up the self-attention kernel by 3.2-4.8$\times$ compared to the start-of-the-art implementation, with the length of the system prompt ranging from 1024 to 4096.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 09:29:19 UTC (506 KB)"

It allows users to design specific prompts to generate realistic images through some black-box APIs. However, some studies reveal that image generators are notably susceptible to attacks and generate Not Suitable For Work (NSFW) contents by manually designed toxin texts, especially imperceptible to human observers. We urgently need a multitude of universal and transferable prompts to improve the safety of image generators, especially black-box-released APIs. Nevertheless, they are constrained by labor-intensive design processes and heavily reliant on the quality of the given instructions. To achieve this, we introduce a black-box stealthy prompt attack (BSPA) that adopts a retriever to simulate attacks from API users. It can effectively harness filter scores to tune the retrieval space of sensitive words for matching the input prompts, thereby crafting stealthy prompts tailored for image generators. Significantly, this approach is model-agnostic and requires no internal access to the model's features, ensuring its applicability to a wide range of image generators. Building on BSPA, we have constructed an automated prompt tool and a comprehensive prompt attack dataset (NSFWeval). Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSPA effectively explores the security vulnerabilities in a variety of state-of-the-art available black-box models, including Stable Diffusion XL, Midjourney, and DALL-E 2/3.

Various supervised-learning approaches have been proposed recently. However, these methods heavily depend on a large amount of high-quality labeled data, which is expensive to obtain in practice. In this study, we present a label-efficient learning approach using a pre-trained diffusion model for multi-organ segmentation tasks in CT images. First, a denoising diffusion model was trained using unlabeled CT data, generating additional two-dimensional (2D) CT images. Then the pre-trained denoising diffusion network was transferred to the downstream multi-organ segmentation task, effectively creating a semi-supervised learning model that requires only a small amount of labeled data. Furthermore, linear classification and fine-tuning decoder strategies were employed to enhance the network's segmentation performance. Our generative model at 256x256 resolution achieves impressive performance in terms of Fréchet inception distance, spatial Fréchet inception distance, and F1-score, with values of 11.32, 46.93, and 73.1\%, respectively. These results affirm the diffusion model's ability to generate diverse and realistic 2D CT images. Additionally, our method achieves competitive multi-organ segmentation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on the FLARE 2022 dataset, particularly in limited labeled data scenarios. Remarkably, even with only 1\% and 10\% labeled data, our method achieves Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 71.56\% and 78.51\% after fine-tuning, respectively.

To bridge this gap, this study examines the property of LRS with respect to item-side fairness and reveals the influencing factors of both historical users' interactions and inherent semantic biases of LLMs, shedding light on the need to extend conventional item-side fairness methods for LRS. Towards this goal, we develop a concise and effective framework called IFairLRS to enhance the item-side fairness of an LRS.

Linear regression is by far the most popular method for performing this task in several fields of research, such as prediction, forecasting, or causal inference. Beyond various classical methods to solve linear regression problems, such as Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge, or Lasso regressions - which are often the foundation for more advanced machine learning (ML) techniques - the latter have been successfully applied in this scenario without a formal definition of statistical significance. At most, permutation or classical analyses based on empirical measures (e.g., residuals or accuracy) have been conducted to reflect the greater ability of ML estimations for detection. In this paper, we introduce a method, named Statistical Agnostic Regression (SAR), for evaluating the statistical significance of an ML-based linear regression based on concentration inequalities of the actual risk using the analysis of the worst case. To achieve this goal, similar to the classification problem, we define a threshold to establish that there is sufficient evidence with a probability of at least 1-eta to conclude that there is a linear relationship in the population between the explanatory (feature) and the response (label) variables. Simulations in only two dimensions demonstrate the ability of the proposed agnostic test to provide a similar analysis of variance given by the classical $F$ test for the slope parameter.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 09:19:26 UTC (8,163 KB)"

However, these models occasionally produce toxic content such as insults, threats, and profanity in response to certain prompts, thereby constraining their practical utility. To tackle this issue, various finetuning-based and decoding-based approaches have been utilized to mitigate toxicity. However, these methods typically necessitate additional costs such as high-quality training data or auxiliary models. In this paper, we propose fine-grained detoxification via instance-level prefixes (FGDILP) to mitigate toxic text without additional cost. Specifically, FGDILP contrasts the contextualized representation in attention space using a positive prefix-prepended prompt against multiple negative prefix-prepended prompts at the instance level. This allows for constructing fine-grained subtoxicity vectors, which enables collaborative detoxification by fusing them to correct the normal generation process when provided with a raw prompt. We validate that FGDILP enables controlled text generation with regard to toxicity at both the utterance and context levels. Our method surpasses prompt-based baselines in detoxification, although at a slight cost to generation fluency and diversity.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 09:04:48 UTC (461 KB)"
