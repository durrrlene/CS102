"FLIPPED","lewiskendell","22 December 2010","""All I ever wanted was for Juli Baker to leave me alone.""Flipped is easily the best love story/relationship movie I've seen since (500) Days of Summer. I'm the kind of guy that you couldn't pay to watch a Nicholas Sparks movie, but that doesn't mean that I can't appreciate a good movie about the highs and lows of love. In a year of formulaic, mind-numbing flicks with no imagination or heart like Letters to Juliet, Flipped is a welcome breath of fresh air. It's about 8 or so years in the lives of two kids who meet when when one of them moves into a new neighborhood. Juli (played by Morgan Lily and Madeline Carroll) is instantly smitten by Bryce (Ryan Ketzner and Callan McAuliffe) the second she sees him drive up to his new house. Bryce, being a typical second grade boy, finds her attention embarrassing and unwanted. As they get older, that dynamic between them remains pretty much the same, but we wouldn't have a very interesting movie if that's all there was to it. Eventually Bryce finds himself on the other side of the equation (flipped, get it?), and has to win back the girl he never knew he always wanted.How odd is it that a movie about a couple of kids handles the topic of love in a more mature and genuine way than almost all of the adult-oriented romantic comedies that we're buried under each year? There's no doubt about it that Flipped will make you say ""aww"" on occasion, but there's a lot more to it than just kids being cute. Humor, issues of class, family conflict, and the lost idealism of youth are introduced into the story by Bryce and Juli's respective families, and there are several outright bittersweet or poignant scenes within the story.The movie is shown from the POV's of both main characters, and often the same event will be shown from each of their perspectives. It works really well, as it really helps the viewer to ""get"" both Bryce and Juli. The kids chosen to play the older versions of the two (Carroll and McAuliffe) are both great, the fact that the story is set in 50's or 60's suburbia adds a believable sense of innocence to it all, and there is just a fresh feeling to the movie that I can't really describe with words.I heartily recommend this to anyone who likes a good, well-written movie, regardless of the genre. You can tell that a lot of heart went into making Flipped, and it shows. Great movie.","

"FLIPPED","neenahhh","5 April 2011","'Flipped' is truly a ""real movie"". Probably what most people enjoyed about this movie was that the events that happened in the movie could might as well have been their reality. Many people in this world (if not all) have experienced having a real crush. This movie shows a crush blossoming from both a guy's and a girl's view. It was very interesting to see two viewpoints on this everyday happening. That is what makes this movie so appealing. Viewers get to watch Bryce and Juli's emotions whenever they see the other. Viewers see Bryce and Juli's smiles that they can't help. Viewers get to know who exactly Bryce and Juli are.Anyone and everyone will enjoy this movie or can at least, relate to it. Even adults! This film will surely take you down memory lane and help you remember the feelings you had when you were first in love. I've never experienced being in love before, but this film makes it seem wonderful. I absolutely loved this film.Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe were great in this film! Even if they're very young, they did wonderful jobs in performing here. In each of their scenes, you could sense the emotions that they were feeling and wanted to convey to the viewers. The characters themselves were also very interesting. Particularly Ms. Juli Baker. It was nice to see such a free-spirited teenager, who was very opinionated and didn't let anything stand in her way. The chemistry that both actors had were average. I thought that they showed their most potential when acting by themselves, in their own surroundings.I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that Rob Reiner, the director of this film, was the same person who directed 'When Harry Met Sally' and 'Sleepless in Seattle'. So far, all romantic-comedies that Rob Reiner has directed has not disappointed me. I can't wait for more of his works! All his rom-coms are excellent additions to the romance movie genre.This was an amazing teenage romantic comedy. Surely one of my favorites, right up there with 'When Harry Met Sally'. Do not miss this film. It's baffling to see that this film isn't as popular as it's supposed to be.Viewed on: April 5, 2011 ; December 16, 2011","

"FLIPPED","napierslogs","13 December 2010","Juli just had to take one look at Bryce's blue eyes, and she knew it was true love. Bryce just had to take one notice of Juli's manic desperation, and he knew it was going to be a friendship of torment. I just had to take one look at the film's artfully designed poster, and I knew ""Flipped"" was a film to be savoured.A beautifully told film of first love, we flip from Juli's point of view to Bryce's point of view, very effectively giving us the true nature of their friendship, love and respect they have for each other. Except in the case of middle-school graders, that love and respect can frequently look like embarrassment, mistrust, and shame. All of those emotions are told with intelligence, subtlety and humour.""Flipped"" has all of the comedy, naiveté and bewilderment of first love. It takes the romantic comedy farther by actually giving us characters with real depth. There is more going on than just Juli and Bryce figuring out their love for each other, and every aspect of this film is well written, touching and relevant.""Flipped"" is a cute film for everybody who fondly remembers that fiercely independent girl or the guy with piercing blue eyes that lived across the street.","

"FLIPPED","leiser18","14 September 2010","""Flipped"" is superbly directed by Rob Reiner and in my book, one of his best movies. It's a wonderfully told coming-of-age story, which I could relate to in many ways. The main two characters, Juli and Bryce, are very likable. Their parents, played by Penelope Ann Miller and Aidan Quinn, Rebecca de Mornay and Anthony Edwards, respectively, are believable in their roles, which they play excellently. I liked the fact that the story is told from two points of views, Bryce first and then Juli. If you want to see a really feel-good movie, instead of watching some dumb comedy or shoot 'em up flick, go see FLIPPED! You will not regret it.","

"FLIPPED","Gpanther67","24 June 2021","I just discovered this gem on Netflix and was impressed, moved and entertained. Its a romantic film about puppy love, so it may not be for everyone (even teens) but I found the leads to be charming and charismatic. The plot device is nothing new, but the charm and early 60's setting make it fresh in many ways. A wonderful cast led by the young leads (now grown!), the late John Mahoney and Aidan Quinn help make this film watchable and enjoyable. A wholesome movie with wonderful moments.","

The character development was good, not like many movies which focus on only the main characters. Though the story was a little predictable, the movie is enjoyable and among a few to which we can relate to.This movie is definitely worth a watch.And it deserves an 8 out of 10.","

"FLIPPED","brettster","14 August 2010","Back in 1973, an episode of ""All in the Family"" told the same story from three different perspectives, one of which was from the point of view of Mike ""Meathead"" Stivic, played by Rob Reiner. Watching his latest directorial effort, I wondered if the ""he said / she said"" gimmick of that episode (""Everybody Tells the Truth"") was what attracted Reiner to ""Flipped,"" the young-adult novel by Wendelin Van Draanen, which employs the same multi-POV technique that Lawrence Durrell perfected with his ""Alexandria Quartet"" in the late 1950s. The film version of ""Flipped"" shows Reiner at the top of his form, a worthy addition to an ouevre that includes such classics as ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" ""Misery,"" ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Stand By Me,"" the 1986 period piece that ""Flipped"" most recalls, with its younger characters and coming-of-age theme. At the heart of ""Flipped"" is Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll), a smart, pretty and thoughtful girl who you just can't help losing your heart to. Juli herself flips for Bryce Loski, who is at first repelled by Juli and then slowly starts to see her for the lovely person she is. The cast is augmented by such pros as John Mahoney (Frasier's dad on ""Cheers""), Anthony Edwards, Aidan Quinn and Rebecca De Mornay and Penelope Ann Miller. The film offers up various slices of life from the late '50s and early '60s that makes for a nostalgic, romantic and very moving film. Special kudos to the filmmakers for finding a girl to play young Juli (Morgan Lily) who looks chillingly like Madeline Carroll; I would have bet anything the two were sisters. For those who are bored by the dumb-dumb summer comedies of 2010 (""The Other Guys,"" ""Dinner for Schmucks"") and the special-effects hijinks of ""Inception,"" this is a tender and emotionally satisfying journey that will stay with you for years.","

"FLIPPED","planktonrules","28 August 2015","I really, really liked this film and now wonder why it didn't make more impact when it debuted. Perhaps it was just one of those films that slipped between the cracks because ""Flipped"" is a wonderful coming of age film--and is among director Rob Reiner's best.The film is set mostly in the early 1960s. A young boy, Bryce, moves to a new neighborhood and almost instantly the girl across the street, Juli, begins mooning over him and acting like she's infatuated with him. But he's 7--and hating girls and mushy stuff is normal and he resists her charms. But she persists as the years pass--and she's convinced herself that Bryce is her dream boy. But, as the years pass, Bryce is just as convinced that Juli is a pest. However, eventually, Bryce's attitude starts to change...too bad Juli's is as well!This is a remarkable film in so many ways. The direction is wonderful--perfectly paced and very sweet. The writing is also exceptionally sweet and enchanting. It also helped that there were some wonderful supporting actors to assist in telling the story-- some characters you really liked and cared about and a couple who were complete jerks. John Mahoney was particularly good, but the entire cast was wonderful in this movie. Overall, the elements all work together to tell a sweet story that anyone could love. My only quibble, and it's a very minor one, is about the music. Too many older films are saturated with oldies music. While a bit is nice, with some it sounds more like a best of record album...and at times I would have preferred ""Flipped"" to have been a bit quieter. Not a major complaint by any means and I still give this film a well deserved 9.","

"FLIPPED","blackfirepro","26 July 2010","Okay, let's dispense immediately with the idea that this film is geared toward teenagers and all of their sap that they go through. I assure you ""mature adults"" out there that this film will delight you also, unless you are a completely hopelessly lost Scrooge. This film should make sense to all ages. Everyone should identify with it. I don't care what kind of a snob, low-life, big wig, or puritan you are, you should enjoy this film. It's never too sappy when it deals with matters of the heart, nor is it too blunt and insensitive.The film is told almost entirely in a voice over of one of the two main characters. It's told in a brilliant he-said she-said style where the same scene is often told twice from the two opposite points of view (Juli's and Bryce's). So we see the opening scene twice. The first time as explained by Bryce, and the second time explained by Juli. This sort of formula is used many a time in the unfolding battle of the sexes. Of course this doesn't happen in every scene—that would get boring. Director Reiner gives us the proper dosage of everything in this film. The proper amount of comedy, romance, and the proper amount of sadness. Never is it sappy or indulgent or even presumptuous. It's a perfect film for what it's worth. The screenplay is absolutely the work of a fine craftsman—or craftsmen Andrew Scheinman and director Reiner. I don't know how long it took to write or how much blood went into it, but this film is the result of excellent work in every department. The two child stars are perfect in their roles (although Bryce could have done better), but the strength of the cast are in supporting actors. The cast is full of great actors, particularly Anthony Edwards as Bryce's arrogant, critical, smart-Aleck father, and the ever-welcome Aidan Quinn as Juli's loving, down-to-earth, tree painting father.I wasn't completely convinced of the excellence of the film until a beautiful scene in which Mr. Baker (Quinn) and Juli go to visit Mr. Baker's mentally retarded brother Daniel, who is so happy with the world and everything in it. But this scene can't be expressed in words, you have to see it. For what it's worth, Flipped is somewhat of a deep film, full of parallels to the real world. All of the characters have the proper amount of development, even the big sycamore tree that Juli likes to sit in and watch the sunrise. Her exploits while up in that tree are so poetic and beautiful when matched up with the pictures on screen. It's a beautiful and insightful scene into the thoughts and feelings of people in general, not just a teenage girl.In this day when films are almost all big-budget action movies with loud explosions, Flipped has explosions of its own kind. It has explosions of heart and feeling and character, all at the appropriate times. I did not find any ax to grind here. Other than the characters, plot, and screenplay, it's also a technically beautiful film. The camera captures everything so clearly with the proper color timing and excellently framed shots. After the mid-way point of the film, being surrounded by excellence, one starts to look for any reason to criticize the film. I found none. Every nuance of the film is done so genteelly and honestly, who can have a problem with it? This film achieves what movies are meant to achieve. They are meant to reach into are minds and draw us in, to entertain and to move us with fright, emotion, tears, laughs, whatever may be the subject. They are meant to create a world around us, whether in space, in the Wild West, in the future, in Bible times, or in the case of Flipped in 1960s suburbia. This film does exactly what it is meant to do. To touch and make us laugh and to remember. That's what it does. It makes us remember what happened or is happening to us. No one can give this a bad review. I don't see how anyone can pick a fight with the film. But I'm blabbing about nothing.In short, Flipped is by far the best film I've seen this year. I do hope the Academy doesn't overlook this like they do so many other ""family"" films. It should at least get a few nominations, if not a win. We'll see what happens. It's only July.www.colewebbharter.com","

"FLIPPED","kpellerin","9 August 2010","This is a coming of age film set initially and briefly in the late 1950s and mostly in the early 1960s. The boy, Bryce, is chased by his neighbor girl, Juli. And is he chased! Juli is immediately smitten or ""flipped"" by Bryce's eyes and the story unfolds.What is unusual about the story telling is that each major event is played back twice - once through the eyes and voice of Bryce and once through the eyes and voice of Juli. It's the same scene, but you wouldn't know that from their differing viewpoints.Juli is the adventurous and interesting one. Bryce just wants to fit in at their Junior High School. Juli slowly begins to unlike Bryce and Bryce slowly begins to appreciate Juli. Will they ever meet at the same emotional place at the same time? That is the drama and story.The art direction and era are right on. It is the Eisenhower and Kennedy years in look, and even in feel. The wives are subordinate to the husbands. The children are mostly respectful to their parents. And the teachers teach and the students learn. But, you can see the seeds being laid for the rebellious war babies of the late 1960s.Rob Reiner is a talented director for romances - ""When Harry Met Sally."" And he is a talented director for handling young actors - ""Stand By Me."" He combines these talents to help us understand the better part of the human condition; that is, love, respect, sacrifice, forgiveness, and honor. And we have fun and laugh along the way. This is like the TV program, ""Wonder Years"" - but heightened and deepened.-Bob, a Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award Jury Member","

It does what few films do in our time (or rather what they don't do): Flipped does not sacrifice its integrity for raunchy, gratuitous content. It's real. The emotions are real. The characters are real. And while it certainly isn't G-rated fluff (and do not be fooled - this is not a film for young children), the movie is definitely gentle and innocent in many ways. On the downside, without giving anything away, the ending of the film could have been better patched together, but overall the movie is a cinematic gem like no other. Go see Flipped!","

A boy who is annoyed by all the attention he gets from the girl across the street. The girl from across the street who has a super crush on the boy tells her part of the story. The boy's father is a man filled with hatred who dispenses politically incorrect lines throughout the movie. The grandfather, the great John Mohoney, is the wise person who tells the boy to really see the girl for what she is, a very special girl. I don't want to give anything away of this jewel of a movie.

"FLIPPED","boomerchinde","5 November 2013","A very enjoyable movie, effectively embracing the coming of age sensitivities which come to us all. Although it is clear there are many nuances of other characters which never get dealt with, it's meant to be that way. This is about the kids, the effect they have on one another, their ability and inability to express their feelings, and what can happen when we finally face our fears about the other sex and dare to take a step toward resolving them. The only issue I have is that the film simply has too many anachronisms -- songs not of the period and figures of speech clearly from the present and not the fifties and sixties, but hey, I'm too darn picky about that stuff. Reiner has done it again, offering us a film in the style and tone of Capra. He has crafted a film of sensitivity and grace, and taught us something about life that most of us lose upon becoming adults. Madeline Carroll is simply wonderful as the independent teen taking life head on, and is a true pleasure to watch. She absolutely carries this film.","

If it had been done by a different director and had different screenwriters, it might be a terrible cliché. Story of first love, known each other since kids, bla bla bla, we've all heard it before.But this movie, it was so pure and so realistic, which is what I love about it most. It wasn't over the top romantic, but it was enough to tug my heartstrings and made me go ""awwww"" instead of going ""ewwww"".The characters felt like real people, and the issues faced in the story felt so real and believable, it made me believe in the basic form of love once more, and that it still existed in real life (even though I know it's just in the movies, but still).Anyway, if you're looking for a story that is refreshing yet vintage, and wanting to have a lovey-dovey grin plastered on your face, then this is the movie to watch.","

"FLIPPED","YJLcool","15 March 2014","Flipped is a sweet, charming, moving, lovely, well-acted coming-of-age romantic drama comedy film.While the plot offers nothing new in particular (as with mostly all rom- com films)...the 'girl meets boy' mixed with 'the not-your-typical girl next door' story, but the storytelling is slightly different. Adapted from the book with the same name by Wendelin Van Draanen, the film is presented in a rather unique 'he-said she-said' style, through the eyes and thoughts of the male lead, Bryce and then again through the eyes and thoughts of female lead, Juli, alternately presenting their views and perspectives on a shared set of events. Nearly every single event that happened in the film is told at least twice, although it seems repetitive, but surprisingly, it never feels boring or annoying. It's actually fascinating and insightful to be able to see into the thoughts and feelings of people in general. Things are not really what it seems and there's always more than meets the eye. As the film progresses, you are so emotionally invested in the characters that you actually begin to eagerly anticipate what the other side of the story might be, how the other person feels the way he/she does. The film also gives a feeling of nostalgia, even for those who never lived in the era (the story is set in 50's or 60's suburban area) or experienced the same events as the two leads. It feels authentic and relatable nonetheless. Juli might appear as an ordinary girl, but she's a sweet, kind, beautiful, daring girl at heart once you get to know her.The two lead stars are perfect in their respective roles. Most of the characters in the film have sufficient character development for the audience to understand them. Flipped is a period young love story, told in a simple and heartfelt manner. A rare cinematic gem.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/shorter-movie-review-flipped.html Rating: 8/10""A painting is more than the sum of its parts. A cow by itself is just a cow.

"FLIPPED","StevePulaski","14 April 2011","Flipped is a coming of age film directed by the coming of age master director Rob Reiner. Reiner directed the tear-jerker Stand By Me and is now back to bring Wendelin Van Draanen's novel of the same name to life. What a treat! Flipped and Stand By Me both make me wish my childhood was full of more adventure and fun rather than just me sitting on the computer writing review after review aspiring to be a critic. I get tears in my eyes to both films because I become so attached to the characters and they're living the life I can only dream to have. With the exception of unfaithful parents when it comes to Stand By Me.What came to mind halfway through the film was why couldn't the movie Speak have been this good? This film proves more than 80% can be done by narration from TWO characters different perspective and it can be done well. Why not do the same for Speak? Most of the dialog in this film is internal and not directly word of mouth and it works. Why not treat Speak the same way? Were they afraid they would mess it up? It begs an explanation to why Laurie Halse Anderson's novel's potential on film was unfaithful to it's film companion.Never reading the book, I do know that it was set in the nineties and the two thousands while this film's setting is in the late fifties and early sixties. It's not that big of a deal with the drastic setting change, but maybe I would've been more upset if I was a huge fan of the book to find out the film was set four years in the past.The movie about Bryce Loski (McAuliffe), a kid who moves into the neighborhood at a young age to immediately become eye candy to his new neighbor Juli Baker (Carroll). Bryce is resistant, while Juli is persistent. She is positive Bryce will give her her first kiss and believes Bryce is just a little shy, when really he wants nothing to do with her. Juli continues up until present day middle school to give Bryce the chance to admit his ""feelings"" for her but doesn't.Juli lives across the street from Bryce and her yard is an eyesore. It's paid for by the landlord since most of the money Juli and her family makes is given to Juli's father's mentally challenged brother. Bryce's family, his dad mostly, is annoyed by Juli and her family's crappy yard and continue to bad mouth and make assumptions about the Baker family when they really have no idea what it's like over there.The film is narrated by both leads more often than not. Usually we'll get five minutes or so of Bryce narrating his side of the story, while Juli narrates her's. It's almost an anthology because we see what goes on from Bryce's standpoint while hearing his thoughts at the moment and then we see what happened prior or after the events of Bryce's because we then go to Juli. It's confusing. But it works all the time.At the beginning of the film I thought the narrations were only used for the audience to get affiliated with the lives of the characters and what happened before we got here. We spend ninety minutes or longer with movie characters and some films don't even give you the damn courtesy to provide us with any kind of background information. We are supposed to just be thrown into a film with characters we sometimes don't even find out the last names to.The one minor problem I have with the film is the end. It leaves off on the wrong note. The film is only ninety minutes when it could and should be longer. The place they ended was fine, but the scenes on the DVD cover and poster never occur in the film. What a letdown.Flipped is 2010's underrated masterpiece and it definitely showcases a worthy coming of age film. It's smooth style of directing, great music, calm feeling even at it's most stressful, and strong leads are more than I could've asked for. Rob Reiner is something else. A true talent in the movie business. Especially when making a movie as heartfelt as this one.Starring: Callan McAuliffe, Madeline Carroll, Rebecca De Mornay, Anthony Edwards, John Mahoney, Penelope Ann Miller, Aidan Quinn, and Kevin Weisman.

"FLIPPED","bkoganbing","19 March 2014","With a technique borrowed from Casino of the story being told from two different protagonist points of view, Rob Reiner gives us a wonderful family film about first love. Flipped is a lot less bloody and a great deal sweeter than Martin Scorsese's gangster classic.The prosperous Loski family moves into the neighborhood where the ne'er do well Bakers live. On that day in the late fifties the kids that grow up to be Callan McAuliffe and Madeline Carroll set eyes on each other. Carroll thinks McAuliffe is the one, but such decisions at the age of 7 are sometimes reconsidered. And McAuliffe can't see her for beans, she's just an annoying girl which is not atypical for the second grade.Moving into junior high school is a different matter. With the onset of puberty both these kids are experiencing conflicting emotions. McAuliffe acts like a jerk sometimes, Carroll expects a bit much.The families are different. Anthony Edwards who is McAuliffe's dad is a bit of a fathead and has a thing about his neighbor's lifestyle. Their yard contains a chicken coop and is not in good shape and it's bringing down the values of the other property on the block. As for Aidan Quinn who is Carroll's dad and his family lives as it does in order to support his brother who lives in a sanitarium, an expensive private one for the mentally retarded. Quinn is a wonderful dad, but the Bakers live a whole lot like the Micawbers waiting for something to turn up.The women are wiser than the men, Rebecca DeMornay and Penelope Ann Miller the wives of Edwards and Quinn respectively bond. McAuliffe also has the wisdom of his maternal grandfather John Mahoney to lean on. He's a surrogate grandfather to Carroll as well.Rob Reiner came up with a real winner. The kids act like real kids as opposed to Hollywood kids. The grownups are neither all wise Deities or complete idiots. The women young and old do come out better than the men. I think everyone is going to like this one.Flipped is highly rated for family viewing.","

"FLIPPED","treeline1","31 December 2010","Juli fell in love with Bryce when his family moved in across the street; they were both in the second grade and for the next six years, much to his chagrin, she chased him. Bryce thought Juli was a bit of an odd duck and he spent all of his time trying to avoid her until one day, in the eighth grade, he stopped running.I love Rob Reiner's classic coming-of-age film, ""Stand By Me,"" so I expected this movie to be similarly engaging, if not memorable. Unfortunately, it suffers from a weak and boring script, dull and stereotypical characters, and such slow pacing that I thought it would never end. Like ""Stand,"" this story is set in the fifties, but there's nothing endearing or nostalgic about it; the era is poorly recreated and felt too contemporary. Each scene is seen and narrated from both Juli and Bryce's viewpoint and this gimmick gets old fast. I didn't believe these children would dissect every single thing the other did and said; it quickly became predictable and tedious and they sounded like obsessed 40-year olds.All of the actors were competent but their characters were either dull or underdeveloped. They didn't do or say anything interesting, let alone cute or charming. This was a humorless and pointless snooze fest for me.","

"FLIPPED","tedg","8 November 2010","Rob Reiner still has it. This sort of movie is an incredible risk because there are so many ways that it can fail. If you have not seen it, it is a simple Junior High romance taken very seriously. Some rather deep family issues apply; frailty and cowardice in the face of small challenges turned larger. Things could have slipped at many points. There is a wise grandfather who could have become the font of wisdom that makes all well. He is set up to do this, but then he falls away to other dynamics.There are a number of crises, large ones to a child, involving issues that threaten adults. In a similar film, there would be just one of these and it would the occasion for a redemptive but false ending. There are secondary adults that are artificially comic, but they come and go so fast the silly tone they carry does not stick. This thing really does make you cry.The main reason I think is that there is a special narrative device. Every scene is told first through the boy's eyes, narrated directly by him, then replayed. It uses the very same takes I think, but using different camera angles and extended differently. It is set in 1963, which means that the speakers will have been married for decades and are recounting the early stages of their romance. This subtle device is profoundly effective. All the retrospective insights are not those of children, but adults with thankful wisdom. Yet another technique of narrative folding. You don't quite know if the romance will work out, but you do know it will end well.The girl is another flatfaced, appealing talent. These actresses don't seem to do well as adults. We'll see.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","

I always had and still do have an aversion to depiction of children in love, because they're usually cloying and that makes me squeamish. But this was just not that. At all. It really just plays out like the perfect encapsulation of a feeling, as if all these people who acted and worked for this were wheels of a train driving that feeling straight into me.

Contrary to some other reviewers, I liked the ""he said, she said"" narrations, because it let's the viewers see the differring perspectives of the main characters as they experience the same situations.Did it bring back memories? Of course it did. I was still a few years from being born in 1963 when the story takes place, but I think first love - its confusion, its elation, and its pain - is the same regardless of the decade. This film is a delightful charmer. Even though the story's destination is plain from the outset, the ride to get there is wonderful. Highly recommended.","

"FLIPPED","Suradit","26 October 2014","I like most of Rob Reiner's work. ""Stand By Me"" is one of my all-time favorites. This, however, was just tedious. Most of the drama and ""touching moments"" were ridiculous, trite and not even on a par with a mediocre soap opera. At times it seemed almost to be a parody of preachy after-school-specials. Too many things were going on, none of them developed beyond the most superficial level. It almost felt like it was put together from bits & pieces only loosely connected. Way too many segments were literally repeated, supposedly so we could see the same thing first from the boy's point of view, then the girl's. But it was essentially watching the same things happen twice with nothing gained from the additional waste of time.Given the film's director and some of the cast this was a major disappointment. If you want to watch something truly evocative of the 50's & 60's and genuinely coming-of-age, get ""Stand by Me"" and watch that (again). Give this a pass.","

"FLIPPED","WHYeat","6 August 2010","iridescent - adjective: showing luminous colors that seem to change when seen from different angles When I hear ""romantic comedy"" I think of 20 something year olds in New York swapping corny lines via Twitter at a bar. Flipped takes a more adolescent perspective on love in a quainter town and in a quainter time. Interestingly enough, even though the main characters are children, the movie targets an adult crowd. Not because there is adult content, but because it takes an adult who has gone through life's lessons to appreciate the complex and pithy analogy and irony. Although in one intense scene a mom ushered her children out of the theater, don't bring your 4 year olds.Flipped is a story about Bryce Loski and Juli Baker, both of whom narrate the story. The movie begins with Bryce's perspective.Bryce's Perspective: He just moved into town. He's in the moving truck helping his father with the boxes until Juli interrupts and tries to help. His father emphasizes that there are valuables in the boxes, but she can't seem to take a clue. ""Shouldn't you go help your mother in the kitchen, Bryce?"" After a second, the confusion on his face vanishes once he understands his father's ploy. He hops out of the truck and Juli follows closely behind. She puts her arm around him. In defense against cooties he flails his arms, but she somehow gets a hold of his hand. He looks right at her face in disgust. Fortunately, his mom comes out. He resorts to his only defense for a boy his age - he hides behind his mom. Juli is so annoying! Juli's Perspective: Bryce just moved into town. Attracted by his ""dazzling"" eyes, she offers to help, but not 2 minutes pass and his father sends him into the house. She could tell from his face he didn't want to go, so she went after him to see if he'd like to play for a bit before he got stuck inside. To her surprise, Bryce takes her hand and looks lovingly into her eyes. Unfortunately, his mom comes out. Embarrassed about his feelings for her, Bryce hides behind his mom. Bryce is so shy! The entire movie follows this pattern. Bryce and Juli take turns describing their thoughts and motives. It's interesting to watch their contradicting thoughts converge into a single stream of unfolding events. The audience also gets a sense of Bryce's and Juli's personalities. Although Bryce is the handsome young kid at school their vastly different narration proves which of the two has more character. The first scene, Bryce's and Juli's first encounter, gives the false impression that Flipped is a love story. It kind of is. But although the thread that holds everything together is the love story between Bryce and Juli the fabric of the story is substance. The substance of character. Each character's role provides a perspective and a life lesson. The fulcrum upon which these morals are balanced is best represented by the sycamore tree - the gem of the town.The sycamore tree has many symbolic interpretations - all of which are equally appropriate for the story and its characters. Vanity. Juli is enthralled by those ""dazzling"" eyes and is irrationally in love with Bryce. Bryce is equally irrational in his disdain of Juli. Bryce's father is especially guilty of this sin. He washes away the pain of lost aspirations with bourbon and takes comfort in condescension. He refuses Juli's fresh eggs produced by her hens simply because of the Bakers' disheveled front yard. However, the sycamore tree could also represent divinity, protection and strength. Juli's favorite spot in town is the peak of the sycamore tree. Here she reveled in the sunset igniting the surrounding clouds and the wind kissing her skin. She suddenly understood what her father meant when he said the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Juli could see it in the landscape. She could even see it in Bryce, but is he greater or less than the sum of his parts? When the tree's owner decided to cut it down, Juli defended it by remaining in the tree. But when it eventually came down, her vanity, her irrational love, began to come down as well. Juli questions the whole that is Bryce Loski. Likewise, Bryce begins to see Juli from a different angle.Flipped is a gem in itself. I laughed. I cried. No I didn't, but it was very moving. And the writing is pretty good. If you enjoyed The Wonder Years or if you ever daydreamed about that one girl you kissed when you were 13, you'll get a nostalgic kick out of Flipped. If you don't know The Wonder Years and you've never been kissed, you'll still love it. It's flippin' great.Read more chick flick reviews for men @ RatedChick.com","

"FLIPPED","nogodnomasters","12 December 2018","The story consists of first person narrations. First his story, then her story. As always things are never as they seem. It is 1957 when Bryce moves next door to Juli. Juli is forceful, even at age 7. Bryce has great hair, eyes, and smile. Juli is bright and has personality. Byrce's family is somewhat shallow, except for the grandfather. Juli's family is poor by comparison but they have different priorities. The story quickly moves to the seventh grade when Juli realizes that Bryce, while good-looking, may indeed be shallow and not the person of character she should be seeking. Meanwhile, Bryce realizes his short comings and sees that Juli is a person of substance. In addition to the good back and forth for what may be expected for kids that age, it includes as a bonus a good father-daughter relationship film as Juli learns what she needs to know about life from her father. What is good about the movie is that the characters are real. They are not all good or all bad, but human beings attempting to do what they think is right in spite of their flaws.This movie has an indie feel, and is enjoyable to the young at heart for people of all ages, but may be especially enjoyable to seventh grade girls.Rebecca De Mornay is barely recognizable as an early 60's mom.One scene of ""violence"" when Bryce's dad slaps his teen daughter for calling him an a-hole.","

They complement each other beautifully, along with the numerous side characters that surround them. Furthermore, the perspective does not remain on one character and in fact transitions between Bryce and Julie. Rob Reiner did a fantastic job with character development throughout this movie. This is definitely one of the best movies that he has directed.Along with the characters, the movie takes place in the late 1950s and early 1960s which gives off such an innocent, heart warming feel.

Rob Reiner did a superb job telling it entirely in a voice over of one of the two main characters Bryce and Juli tells each side of the story from each point of view. Sometimes the views are not the same. Juli's favorite spot in town is the top of the sycamore tree which is cut down by the yards owner. Juli starts to questions the whole that is Bryce Loski. Likewise, Bryce begins to see Juli from a different angle.Bryce's father played by Anthony Edwards is a typical father of the late 50's. He cares more about the outside appearance then what is really within. He has a darkness inside of him. The wife played by Rebecca De Mornay is susie home maker type of role. The grandfather father played by John Mahoney is a soft speaking man, who moves in with the Loski family tries to get Bryce to see the world with open eyes.It has a great use of that periods music that is well thought out.

Remember those days where much of your thoughts and actions were invested in trying to spend time with your special someone, while that person diligently avoided you, or vice versa? Well, if no, ""Flipped"" will be more than happy to take you back to that point of your life where the world isn't much of a concern, where responsibilities were minimal, where feelings were everything.Most of ""Flipped"" takes place in the year of 1963, a time where kids are required to talk to each other in order to achieve an actual conversation. (""What is this In-ter-net?"") Young Bryce, and the rest of the Loski family, has just moved in to a different neighborhood. And a new home comes with new neighbors. Bryce is getting ready for second grade, who believes that it will be torture because Juli Baker from across the street is publicly in love with him. Juli is trying to get Bryce to like her while Bryce is trying to get Juli to leave him alone. Now tell me, when you were younger, were you a Bryce or a Julie?We see that these kids act out their immediate emotions, and we know that they have yet to understand the depth and reasons behind them. What's to adore other than Bryce's dazzling eyes? So what if Juli likes to spend hours on top of a tree? These kids didn't really ask these questions to themselves, but they didn't need to. They are in the second grade, and are reasonably immature. But, as Bryce and Julie grow older, more mature, they start seeing things at a deeper, more curious perspective. A few years have passed, and Bryce and Juli notice things about the other that were invisible to them before, and their feelings start to flip.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/flipped/","

Lets just say in the words of Robert Downey Jr. He went way past full retard. I have a mentally ill aunt and I've been around her and her fellow roommates at her home my whole life. They go from 0 to 100 on the stereotypical caricature of a mentally ill person. That made me laugh too, at how ridiculous that whole part of the movie was.

"FLIPPED","sunraider","27 November 2010","I decided to ""rent"" this ON DEMAND because I recalled an interview Rob Reiner had done with conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt to discuss this movie at the time of its initial theatrical release. The way this film was talked about made you think it was another ""Stand By Me."" NOT! I hate to give this film such a low rating because there's nothing offensive about the film, but it is boring, slow and just plain uninteresting. I can't even bump up the rating because of chemistry, acting, or even soundtrack. There's simply nothing to recommend this film. The plot is so tame and clichéd, and yet the filmmaker does nothing special to make it seem fresh or inventive. The lead characters are uninteresting and while I don't expect young teens to generate sexual tension, I do expect them to have some chemistry or connect in such a way that makes you want to see the two together. At the expense of any real character development or even a semblance of a strong storyline, we get near-constant voice-over narration. Screen writing 101: show us, don't tell us! From the interview that Reiner gave, I understand that the original book on which the film is based was set in recent times, but Reiner decided to push it back to the early 60s. That would be OK if not for the all too modern expressions that come from the characters. The family worries about ""salmonella poisoning"" from the neighbor's eggs? Was the general public even aware of that issue in 1963? The young male lead complains about his neighbor ""stalking"" him and she in turn refers to him as being ""visually-challenged."" Had terms that those even been coined by 1963? The young teens casually throw out words like ""bullsh#$,"" ""jacksh#$,"" and say things like, ""are you freakin' mental?"" OK, I was born in the 70s so maybe these terms and phrases were common in 1963, but I can't recall any film made during that decade that had characters that sounded like these people did. Poor film overall.","

"FLIPPED","Trentflix","25 April 2011","I saw the good reviews and was excited for a family film I could enjoy without worrying about content. I can see how this would appeal to a person if they found the main characters endearing. I didn't. The girl is a flighty daisy-minded girl who will likely grow up and make beaded jewelery for a living and the typical boy will grow up to be the typical insignificant person he is working a dead-end blue collar job. There are apparent anachronisms, scenes of spectacularly unspectacular acting and the ""flipped"" visual effect that you find in bad power point presentations never gets old. Looking for the positive points though, I'll never have to watch it again.","

Therefore, he has always treated the heroine with the arguments of others, not daring to tell his true thoughts.And Julie is different. She has the courage to express her emotions. Even if she fails, she will continue to work hard. She is obsessed with what she loves and will not give up until the last moment.There are also some very beautiful sentences in the movie, like
""Some of us get dipped in flat, some in satin, some in gloss. But every once in a while you find someone who's iridescent, and when you do, nothing will ever compare. ""

"FLIPPED","GethinVanH","15 December 2010","The last good movie Rob Reiner directed was ""Misery"" in 1990, nearly 20 years ago. Since then he's been pumping out a lot of crap like ""The American President"" and ""The Bucket List"". Flipped falls into the same category. It's a movie about a suburban, middle-class white American kid who comes of age. To top it all off, I discovered that Flipped is based on a book which takes place in the 2000s. You've seen this movie if you've seen 'My Girl' or 'The Wonder Years' you've already seen this movie.American Graffiti and Hairspray are at least more challenging and add something new. 'Flipped' adds nothing new except for a dual-narrative from both the teen boy and teen girl. This is interesting but since the male character is so utterly devoid of any charisma I couldn't stand listening to him. Reiner got it right with 'Stand By Me' by using an adult narrator (Dreyfuss) who could actually handle the task. The young actors are pretty bad narrators.There's nothing new here and it's pretty much an all-white cast. This is not a time to be sentimental about with it's lack of diversity and sterile environments. Reiner had the option of having the film take place in the 2000s and obviously rejected it. He prefers to work in the cocoon which is the 1960s coming of age story.","

The thing he did with the both Julie and Bryce aspect was phenomenal! You get to see the happening from both Julie and Bryce's point of view. It was really good made! The actors were so truthful to their characters and they really became them, Julie played by Madeline Carroll and Bryce played by Callan McAuliffe did a really good job! They together, made the best of pairs, and I could see my self in Bryce so many times which was so interesting. And that's what's so cool about this movie, that I believe you can all say ""I've been there"" and see yourself in some of the characters. I didn't want it to end, I actually wanted it to be a bit longer, I wanted to see them growing up together, and see them growing old together that would've been a great ending. Not that the ending there is now was bad.. NO, it was actually really good! It's a family film which you can watch over and over again, and I highly recommend you to watch it! I give it 9/10 :)","

"FLIPPED","theinaniloquent","4 May 2012","Before I begin, I haven't read the book. So if your looking for in-depth comparisons look elsewhere. I'm hear to express my thoughts on the movie itself, and it's quality. Not the books. Thank you.Listen to me carefully: the movie is not bad. It's well-translated from the book, it's *sometimes* well-acted, and it's well-directed. The movie has loads of heart and sorts of warmheartedness. So your probably asking yourself why this film stands with his 5. Well, I'll tell you. The movie is firstly contrived. I suspected it the moment I saw it. The most unique thing the movie does is it's narrative. You're are getting the guy's side to the story but then also the girl's side. It was actually quite nice. But aside from all that sappy stuff, the movie reaches too far and ends up being formulaic. Sure. It has that unique narrative side to it, but the other side? They tried to fill it up with as much clichés as possible, and by the end, it was about to explode. Next? The movie is sometimes really badly acted. Some of it seems like the two main characters are just running through it, waiting to the get to the finish line/money. But the main thing that bugged me was two characters. One is Bryce's dad Steven Loski played by Anthony Edwards. He was a complete asshole, but his attempts at trying to be an asshole are easily laughable. He has no reason to be an asshole either, he just goes on and on and on, and you're not believing one bit of it. The next is Juli's cousin Daniel Baker. When I first saw him, I thought it was a joke. Seriously. He was apparently brain-damaged from birth? I know people like that, and it wasn't anything like that. The movie tries to express something it really can't, but it tries so I give it credit for that.. So with all that said, Flipped is just another film. The director has made some profoundly great films, but Flipped seemed to be a film made in the duration of his mid-life crisis. I was entertaining, and found the movie had potential, but it didn't do anything new. And new is good. So the movie was bad.. Anyways, I recommend the movie for people who aren't too biased on movies that aren't trying to be something it's not. But, for me, this movie just doesn't do it. 5/10.","

"FLIPPED","PandoraProductions4","17 August 2015","Flipped is one of those gems that slip by, comparatively unnoticed. Slammed by critics upon it's initial release, it was a box office failure, barely making one fourteenth of it's budget. Years later, it has garnered a small but loyal following. The fact is, the movie is very good. One of 2010's best. It's not a standard teen flick, it occurs on the threshold of adolescence. Bryce and Juli are longtime neighbours. Juli has been obsessed with Bryce for years, but Bryce has never been interested in her. The movie's title is clever. As Bryce begins to become more keen on Juli, so she begins to lose interest in him. So they flip in their opinions of one another, basically. Being told from two perspectives- Bryce's and Juli's, adds to the ""flipped"" aspect. It's highly entertaining to see how their interpretations of the same events are different. Callan McAuliffe, who plays Bryce actually looks like a kid from the 50's (which is the movie's setting). Madeline Carroll's as cute as a button, and also gives a great performance. Unusual for a kids movie, the adult characters are also quite nicely fleshed out. It's Rob Reiner's best movie since ""A Few Good Men"". The themes of friendship,family, loss, and love make this moving picture...well, moving. I can only hope that more people discover this movie. Spread the word!","

"FLIPPED","BeneCumb","11 September 2013","Although my (pre-)teen years were decades ago, it is sometimes nice to remind and compare - in particular, if script and directing are good. In Flipped, it is so indeed, plus a good choice of child actors provides additional value to the movie. Unlike many youth films made in this century, the story here focuses on human values, generation ties, friendship etc, not on ""cuteness"" or being popular on account of personal wealth. The two neighboring families depicted are different (creative vs. formal), and those differences bring interesting angles and twists into the storyline. The cast is evenly strong as well, the grown-up characters are performed by Rebecca De Mornay, Anthony Edwards, John Mahoney, Penelope Ann Miller, Aidan Quinn... The latter was the most interesting to me and his presence on screen was more frequent as well. Kevin Weisman performs a small, but very difficult role of a retarded person.Recommended to all families with children, although contemporary minor might consider the events as too naive from distant past... But family life can be without constant swearing, drugs, sexual hints etc. as well.","

"FLIPPED","GeneralUrsus","23 May 2011","From the opening frames this film had a cloying, cutesy ersatz sweetness that was annoying. The movie's look and feel resembles a television episode. Flipped which is based on a novel seems like a watered down, rip-off of television's The Wonder Years. However this material is neither funny, heartwarming or memorable on any level.The acting across the boards is stilted, forced and borders on caricature particularly from Anthony Edwards as a belligerent father who's abusive qualities stem from his unfulfilled desires to be a musician. The only decent performance in the film is from character actor John Mahoney. His sweet, endearing portrayal as a grandfather is honest, moving and presents the only flowering hope that this film might blossom.What really destroys this film though is the constant use of narration. At least 80% of the movie is narrated in dull, garbled monologues from both of the two main characters. Another major flaw is the endless ping- pong, story telling device where we see the same scene over again from the perspective of each of the two main characters.We witness entire passages of this film devoted to nonsensical issues like whether or not to eat the neighbor's farm fresh eggs because they might be tainted by salmonella. The film does not draw us in, the characters are bland, the situations are ridiculous and the pacing is monotonous. I have seen Folger's Coffee Commercials that were more uplifting than this drivel. For me Flipped flopped.","

"FLIPPED","tomdude0","8 June 2011","UPDATE: I read the book, and I compared the two. I'm going to do something daring and say that the movie was better. Something about the movie was more innocent, and there was a sense of finality at the end. The book was excellent, but something about the movie was just...better. Anyways, here's the original review.Flipped is about the romantic relationship between two kids, Bryce and Juli. When Bryce first moves into the neighborhood, Juli instantly becomes obsessed with him and keeps this obsession going for over half a decade. Bryce, however, feels that she's a pest and constantly tries to avoid her. But eventually the story ""flips""--Bryce starts having feelings for Juli and tries to express them.Overall, the story was great. The setting was changed from the more modern setting of the book to the late '50s and early '60s because back then it was harder to get hold of someone, making the whole romantic situation more awkward. There was one thing that confused me a little, but I won't say it because it'd spoil an important point in the story. If you're paying really close attention you'll notice it.The acting was great, Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe are definitely two to watch. I still remember that Subway commercial that Madeline did and she's grown a lot. The two do have a lot of chemistry and they portray the awkwardness of romance and just being a teenager very well. For the most part, character development was good. Some of the minor characters weren't developed as well, but hey, they're minor characters for a reason.I think the ending was the most beautiful part. I wasn't expecting it at all, and it was really moving. There's a reason this movie won the Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award.I've watched this movie multiple times, and every time I find myself with a huge grin that I just can't seem to get rid of afterwards. I can't get enough of it. I guess you could say I flipped over Flipped.","

The thought narration is a bit much sometimes. 90% of the film is filled with their thoughts which can be quite hindering. But I can overlook that and enjoy the storyline just the same.It's about a girl who has a childhood crush on a boy who lived across from her house. She keeps on stalking him (a bit weird to think about, especially if we think in a reversed gender role, but I vouch kids had done it out when they were kids, I was one). It captures that young love where we obsess about our crush and fantasize a whole lot more which makes them look attractive than the reality, and when reality revealed itself, we realize they're just a normal person like us. I love that, because it's relatable.The movie has a happy ending. They are together, showing them planting a tree together.","

This movie though I couldn't get into as much as I really wanted to. The thought that continuously crept into my head was how big of an arrogant a-hole Bryce was. He is the stereotypical douche that we all knew in high school who was mean and rude to people because he thought it made him look cool. Then finally he decides what he wants and thinks he deserves it. Goes the whole movie being just a crappy person then decides he wants juli now and decides he will start being nice to get what he wants.I get what they were trying to do with this movie but I think the execution was poorly done. Especially with Bryce's character.In conclusion there will be plenty of people that will love the movie but I couldn't get over my hatred of Bryce and his character to enjoy this movie.","

"FLIPPED","aayush-mudgal","16 August 2014","Flipped is a unique coming of age romantic comedy movie based on the novel ""Flipped"" by W. Draanen. The movie captures a beautiful transition and flip in nature of two second graders. It's a bit too Wonder Years at times, but the odd two-narrators gimmick plays right into the film's ""flip"" in structure.It's a surprising-engaging and beautifully-told story about young romance though being static for few moments in the middle. The story revolves around Bryce Loski and Juli Baker, young children who are brought together with the strong bond of love. Juli falls in love at first sight with Bryce who has a weird feeling of attraction and isn't too sure of his love for her. From the very first day he tries to keep her away, at times insulting her and letting her down, but she is never angered or agitated.. She repeatedly tries to forget his behavior, but it's when this stacks up so high, and she feels that she might be wrong for him that at this time, Bryce starts experiencing a deep sense of love and affection towards her. He repeatedly tries to contact her, talk to her, and makes all possible attempts and pleads her for forgiveness. But when she realizes that Bryce has redeemed himself, they both share a smile and continue and hold each other's hand. This flip of minds is beautifully portrayed in the movie.It's through their experiences that they get to know about themselves and about each other. Despite being opposite in all sense they both fall in love with each other.The importance of understanding varying perspectives is always worth communicating, and Flipped, despite its cloying approach, manages to deliver this idea with a decent amount of sincerity intact.If you want a ultimately feel-good film about young love, this is a movie to watch. !","

"FLIPPED","LitCritChas","7 March 2011","I picked up the film when I found it on sale in a Blockbuster that was having a ""going out of business"" sale. I was not dissatisfied with what I bought in the least. It was both a cathartic and feel-good film all at once. Through watching it, you can be transported back to that time when you had your own first crush and were that guy or girl with a crush. It also did a beautiful job of showing the maturation which occurs from the initial crush to the actual budding of love. I felt the challenges set forth in testing the character strengths of both protagonists and pushing them to become better individuals and partners for one another. Rob Reiner did a wonderful job in direction and casting prodding the actors to grow and develop in a realistic manner over the course of the film. The supporting adult cast was well cast and artfully played, giving subtleties that made me appreciate them & their handiwork. They also developed their characters in a manner that didn't distract from the main protagonists. I wish the same could be said about the other young teenage actors who almost all came out as cardboard cut-out stereotypes that have been rehashed from young teenage movie to young teenage movie.Now for my nitpicks: An interesting thing I noticed was that Rob Reiner takes the novel out of the time period it was originally set in: 1994 - 2000 and puts it instead in the ever nostalgic 1957 - 1963 time period (when he himself was the age of the protagonists). After discovering this directorial choice: the two issues I had with the film were immediately explained and made sense.First, the critique of government run facilities that exists in the film wasn't as vocal at the time. I'm sure it existed, but overall there was a general trust of the government & its facilities--the expansion of which through the New Deal had just helped the nation get through the Great Depression & WWII--or at least that's what the commonly held belief was at the time. It isn't until the fallout from Carter's presidency & the emergence of the Reagan Revolution that this trend would be reversed--and a distrust of government facilities would begin to appear and become more popular. So the 1994 - 2000 setting of the book makes the existence of this critique make complete sense in a way that a 1957 - 1963 setting of the film does not.My second nitpick was with the incongruity of names with the generations. Grandpa Chet would work out to be in the book part of the same cohort as Lynetta, Skylar (a name that according to most name graphs indicates wasn't used in the US until the 1980s--when the original character in the book would've been born), Matt, & Mark have been ""aged back"" to--i.e. he was born in the book during the early - mid 1940s as his name suggests. It also wasn't just Chet & Skylar but nearly all of the other characters who had names that were less popular during the time period the film was recast in (for their specific generations) than in the original time period of the book. However I doubt most people would notice such minute details or even care about them, not when presented with such a heart-warming coming of age story set to some of the best music Doo Wop has given us.Overall, I'd say that you really have to nitpick (like I did) to find fault with Flipped--or be a confirmed cynic.","

Truly an uplifting an humorous film, which reminds us all of how great life can be when we keep things in perspective. This one is now part of my collection, as is any Rob Reiner film.I loved the story of us and am always amazed at this filmmaker's in depth understanding of both human complexity and humor. It is the story that makes the film and this is a must see example of such!Heart, love, life are consistent themes for this filmmaker, thank God.

"FLIPPED","sabrinatheblogster","24 January 2014","The thing with this movie is: it's a decent story but it's wrong on so many levels.First of all, in the story these kids don't age beyond, what, twelve? They should not be thinking about love. They should be thinking about having fun, being creative, doing things, making friends, and so on. This drama does not fit into the lives of such young people. It's not romantic, it's unhealthy.Second, when a guy stalks a girl like that it's creepy, but when a girl stalks a guy like that it's cute? Geez talk about double standards, let alone the message this sends out to young people. Just chase a person long enough and he/she will fall for you eventually. Spoiler: that's not the way it works, folks. If he or she is just not that into you, move on. Also, don't stalk people. It's wrong, mmkay? And take no for an answer, mmkay? Aaaaand don't go secretly sniffing people, no matter if you're a boy or a girl, and no matter if he/she smells like water melon, cheese sticks, or old books. Just don't. do. it. It's f*cking creepy and NOT cute. Mmkay? Third, as one of the plus sides, this movie totally made me discover something about myself. When they have the Boy Auction - or whatever (again, at that age?! And holy sh*t, talk about shallow standards) - there's a boy being auctioned as the first of them all. He seems so very uninteresting but then we find out he's carrying a basket with chicken salad sandwiches, onion dip, and cherry pie. That's when I went: 'hell that's my kind of guy. I'd date him.' So there's that standard, reaffirmed by the next scene where Bryce asks the blonde if they can please talk about something else than tans or food. Tans, yes, but food? You no like to talk about food? Go f*ck yourself, Bryce Lovski, food is awesome. How boring is he? Also, 'Bryce Lovski'? Does anyone notice the resemblance with 'Kyle Brovlovski'? South Park fantasy maybe? Last but not least, in the last scene Julie goes 'and then, for the first time we really talked' (or something). Why on earth would you chase a guy for so many years if you don't even feel like you've had a decent conversation with him? It's so stupid my vocabulary doesn't even suffice to describe it.Stupid movie, stupid priorities, stupid standards, loved the food.","

"FLIPPED","A_Different_Drummer","24 October 2016","Reviewers' Notes: 1. A number of mainstream reviews noted that this was Reiner's most ambitious project in almost two decades. That is a ""back-handed compliment: and it is as much a comment on how he has been coasting for years, as it is a nod to this specific effort.2. The flaws in the film are -- ironically -- typified in the official poster for the project, where the artwork has the two leads sitting in the (infamous) tree on the same branch. Of course in the actual story they are never actually together in the tree. For film buffs of the future, this raises the question of whether the script was rewritten (and no one told the promo dept); or if simply someone inside the production company was trying to express what the film should have been...? 3. On the plus side, it is remarkable how much mileage Reiner gets from the shopworn devices of voice-over and double-POV. That the viewer comes to expect and get involved with these tricks is a big plus.4. The supporting cast is solid but not solid enough to overcome any shortcomings in the performances from the two young leads. The good news? There are no such shortcomings! The two young leads essentially pick up the film on their backs and carry it to the finish line.5. Reminded me in some ways of the original Korean MY SASSY GIRL (recommended!) which remains the most powerful rom-com of the last few decades. And that is not merely a back-handed compliment, that is the real deal. To suggest that love can blossom in such unlikely circumstances is, at the end of the day, what makes this film memorable.","

"FLIPPED","dishlady69","14 August 2017","Rob Reiner's nostalgic romcom doesn't quite hit the mark the way his other films have. While the movie does convey the general awkwardness of being a teenager in the 1950s. Unfortunately, it also drags out the ignorance of a generation out along with it. Rebecca De Mornay and John Mahoney are thankfully around to save us all from the overwhelming ignorance conveyed by Anthony Edwards (who loses quite a few brownie points in my book for taking this part in the first place).Madeline Carroll is an incredible find, though her character is a little overdone, and Callan McAuliffe is convincing as the awkward teen as he most likely had just survived his awkward teens when cast for the film. It's a film you REALLY WANT to like if you're a fan of Reiner's work, but in general the film drags on a little too much, highlighting comments of VAST ignorance that the mixed audience viewing the film with me found very offensive.","

"FLIPPED","eightyproofsunshinefilms","29 July 2011","So I had this on my ON DEMAND queue for about a week. I was afraid to watch it because the blurb that describes the film made it sound, well really stupid. Plus I thought it spanned over like a whole lifetime not just into 8th grade. It reminded me of Winnie and Kevin from Wonder Years, which I always loved and still miss to this day and wish it would come on DVD. This film had those tender moments and connection between the two kids. Basically 2nd grade new boy moves into neighborhood and girl across the street instantly falls for him just by his sparkling eyes. The boy well he doesn't feel the same way of course. The film moves on to 6th grade where the girl is still gaga and fawning over the boy who gets a girlfriend just to detract from the Girl's obsession. That begins to make them grow apart. Then you begin to get to know the kids as individuals and their families. Each family has kind of a BEHIND DOORS ONLY life and it is things people could relate to. Finally the boy realizes he has feelings for the girl and she has decided she hates him. So to make a long story short and not divulge too many spoilers, it brings it back to the point of will they or won't they. I can remember being a tween and then a teen and those first feelings of ""puppy"" love or real love as teenagers always feel it is. I also had no idea it was filmed in Michigan and being a Michigan filmmaker myself it made me happy to see something so touching being made here. Plus well Rob Reiner usually makes a good film. All in all I highly recommend this film for anyone having a bad day that just needs to see something that kinda makes you nostalgic and remember butterflies.","

"FLIPPED","ElliesWonder","27 September 2017","An unusual romantic story, finally there is a fresh good one different from Hollywood's 'sickness porn' - rebellious teenagers either love bad or love vampire, mystery. This puppy love definitely refreshed my eyes! Their warm heartening love was developed with logic, the flipped went with the flow, it has nothing like a crazy drama. Yet this romantic story still captured my eyes with its heartwarming moments.Besides the movie storyline, this movie really shows the difference between boys and girls inequality in mental maturity. I remembered I watched a video about an experiment, tester made some terrible taste juice and asked kids' options with a guilty face because of her terrible cooking skills; the experiment reflects the difference between boys and girls in young age 3-5 years old. Boys would honestly speak the truth of nasty taste, yet girls would show their compassion in young age, they would try to comfort the tester that her drink wasn't too terrible at all. That experiment was interesting, it just shows that girl naturally has better social skills development compared to the boy.Therefore Juli started her consciousness in age 7, and experienced some thoughtful thoughts about the ""complete painting view"" in her young age, and in the same age arrange, the boy, Bryce Losk just flipped. Luckily Bryce found the good of Juli, and hold her hands at the end.","

For Juli Baker and Bryce Loski, a childhood crush was life or death. With that, Flipped is a lovable story about your childhood love and perhaps the judgements you make about people before you really know them, something everyone is guilty of when you're young. The bow that gets wrapped at the end doesn't necessarily feel earned, but it's a pretty sweet little film that not many have seen, and that should change.7.0/10","

The reason why he was that way was not explored enough (the subplot surrounding his father) to forgive or even try to understand his behaviour. Juli was a beautifully spirited character and the film followed her journey of realising that Bryce was not all she first saw in him. Therefore, the ending was out of place, and frankly a bit of a cop out.I came for a wholesome coming of age film and left feeling empty and like I'd wasted my time.","

"FLIPPED","mysteryfan04","7 January 2011","If any three words were to describe Flipped, those words would be 'sweet', 'simple', and 'likable.' It's too light to be fully memorable, but it is endearing enough to enjoy. Bryce and Juli are two neighbors whose parents don't think too highly of each other. They've grown up together, and she had a crush on him throughout elementary school. Now that they're in middle school, they finally have the guts to tell each other how they really feel. But many events, such as those involving a sycamore tree and a hatch of chicks, mess with all of their emotions. Are they really into each other? Will their love last? The journey to the answers to these questions is sometimes awkward but still interesting. Rob Reiner's directing style suits the film well, but the script contains too many awkward moments which can distract from the sweetness of the film. The narration of the protagonists eventually becomes grating and excessive. The movement of the setting from the 2000s to the 1960s causes the film to feel too safe and clichéd. As a result, the movie wouldn't be nearly as enjoyable without Madeline Caroll and Callan McAuliffe in the two lead roles. Their chemistry really is lasting, and their performances are really sensitive and emotional. Caroll's scene in the sycamore tree will leave you affected to the right degree. McAuliffe does a great job of portraying a sensitive but determined character eager to set things right, even though he is not brave enough to express his actual emotions. The music and score are also brilliantly crafted and fun to listen to. Flipped may not live up to its beloved source novel, but it is a charming and entertaining film.","

The cast, the production, the story line, the ambient feel seem to work together so well. The girl looked weird and annoying in the first scenes but eventually she will grow on you as story going. I saw some comments about the choice for 50's-60's theme was unnecessary. I totally disagree. It is the major part of what made this movie so heartwarming. It would not have worked in present time line. No girls would feed her chicken in the backyard. The boy would not have been so nice to her even if he does not like her. In these days, if you annoyed a girl you just post something to embarrass her in social networks or just try to take advantage of her. So it is a solid reason to go back in much nicer time. I think the only thing it needed to be changed is the name. I missed this flick for years just because the name ""Flipped"" was not appealing enough to me.","

Rob Reiner co-wrote and directed, it is set in the late 1950s then the early 1960s, 1963 to be exact, the year I graduated from high school. The characters seemed pretty authentic to the period.It is a story about a small boy whose family moves to a new neighborhood, and he is immediately befriended by a small girl his age that lives across the street. We learn later that she was taken by his eyes, his gaze, and immediately liked him. But as bold as the girl was, the boy was shy. She always told things as they were, he often evaded the truth because it seemed easier. At different points she doesn't ever want to talk to him again, or he doesn't ever want to see her again. As budding relationships often experience. Madeline Carroll plays the girl at about 13, Juli Baker. Australian actor Callan McAuliffe plays the boy, Bryce Loski, at the same age. Most of the story is told at that period of time when they were junior high students.It is a wonderful cast overall, with the likes of Rebecca De Mornay, Anthony Edwards, Penelope Ann Miller, and Aidan Quinn as parents and John Mahoney as a grandparent. Good family movie, very sweet in spots, and mostly very realistic.","

"FLIPPED","fernandoschiavi","6 October 2023","The word ""flipped"" has several definitions in almost any online dictionary - most of them relating to turning something over, throwing something, turning pages, and so on. However, this Rob Reiner film of the same name refers to the traditional use of the word, meaning ""to get excited about something you find attractive."" With only one successful film since the mid-1990s - and that being the forced and contrived cancer comedy ""Before We Go"" - Rob Reiner appears to be trying to recapture his mojo with ""Flipped,"" a return to the coming-of-age film, sometimes painful and sometimes moving, which he accomplished so splendidly in his 1986 film ""Stand by Me.""But what was seemingly easy more than two decades ago is now a struggle. Reiner once again demonstrates compassion and insight into young people's struggles to gain self-knowledge, but in his new film, clearly overly fictional characters and forced situations overwhelm his story. ""Flipped"" is a great addition to the coming-of-age genre, I believe it will join the ranks of other favorites like ""Stand by Me"" and ""Goodbye, Boys"", although perhaps not as quickly. Anyone who grew up in the era will no doubt identify with this near-flawless depiction of life in early 1960s America. But the attraction doesn't stop there, because the story is universal: Flipped, crushes and everything that accompanies them, are things that everyone can identify with at any age. It is part of human history. It has the same timeless feel as the recent cinematic release ""Ramona and Beezus"" in terms of its positive nostalgia appeal, but with much more depth as this film is aimed at adults as well as young people.Reiner co-wrote ""Flipped"" with Andrew Scheinman (producer of ""A Matter of Honor"") based on the novel of the same name written by Wendelin Van Draanen and, with his inimitable directorial style (""Stand by Me,"" ""Before Leave""), Reiner managed to involve the audience in a touching story that awakens many emotions and some tears. Without revealing anything about this very predictable plot, I can say that Reiner manages to incorporate the connotations of ""Flipped"" in several ways that give the film psychological intensity. There are clever montage sequences that outline the unrequited love that develops between the main character, Bryce Loski (new rising star Callan McAuliffe), and the girl Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll, ""The Spy Who Knew Too Little""). Who lived in the house opposite him at 243 Bonnie Meadow Lane. Each scene is brilliantly filmed by Thomas Del Ruth and expertly edited by Robert Leighton.The film begins in first grade in the late 1950s and quickly reaches eighth grade in the year 1963, where the rising action gets into full swing. What sets this film apart from many others of its kind, one of the many things that make it truly valuable, are the interesting back-and-forth narratives of each character, recreating the same scenes (with uniquely different perspectives and settings) but from their own ""he said, she said"" perspectives, all of which remain faithful to the book (albeit rewritten in the '60s setting by Reiner). The emphasis on editing to represent these transitions is original and incredible. The fluidity of this cohesive cast speaks not only to their acting talents and Reiner's excellent direction, but also to the articulate casting choices made by Janet Hirshenson and Jane Jenkins.This is a film we all already know. The girl has had a crush on the boy since first grade. The boy doesn't care much about her, but he can't avoid her because she lives across the street from her house. The girl is a dreamer, determined, with a captivating love for life. The boy resists the urge to follow this dream with her or to join her in the highest branches of the neighborhood tree - which becomes the metaphor for the rest of the film. The tree is the place without prejudice, where clarity of vision brings truth, insight and purpose to live. The grandfather on the left enters the scene; he suggests to the boy that there may be more to this girl than is on the cover - talking about the girl. The boy is now a growing teenager who really messed things up, but now he changes and is actually interested. Your grandfather said, ""Some of us are painted with flat paint, some with satin paint, some with glossy paint. But every now and then, you find someone who is iridescent, and when you do, nothing else compares."" The grandfather was remembering his late wife when he said this, but the boy takes it seriously. The question is: is it too late to conquer it?There's a narrative device in Rob Reiner and Andrew Scheinman's script, based on Wendelin Van Draanan's novel, that could be tiresome, but works here because it's been carefully thought out. The film's key events are seen from both points of view: Bryce's and Juli's.Teenagers often fall out of step emotionally, and these two need John Philip Sousa. There are no tricks: the scenes play out as they seem, and not in alternate universes. But they look so different depending on who is seeing them. Reiner sets most of the film in 1963 (his classic ""Stand by Me"" takes place a few years earlier, in 1959), and it's probably not just out of nostalgia. In some ways, this is the last year of American teenage innocence, before the 1960s took over. Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe, who seem incredibly vulnerable, are sincere and pure, and are characters we believe can be hurt. Some of today's teenagers are more wounded and cynical than their parents ever were. And for some of them, sex is not an unexplored land. Perhaps what makes ""Flipped"" so charming is how it recreates a life we wished we had when we were 14. This is true for adults, and I also suspect it is true for some 14-year-olds. In a way, the audience also ""goes back in time"".The good script is one of the great merits of the work. It's interesting the way the story is shaped, always showing the point of view of the boy and the girl, going back and forth in time, and even showing the same events, the change in point of view gives us the chance to build alongside of the characters and their feelings, gives us the chance to see the plot from a much bigger perspective than its own protagonists, the only ones who don't understand that they deserve to be together. And just as Juli's father says at a certain point, that it is necessary to look at the landscape, the sum of all the parts, not the isolated elements, ""Flipped"" is precisely that, the sum of these looks, of parts of the same story and the result is simply magical, enchanting. I also like how nostalgia works in the work, not only in what is produced in the viewer, but it is also what motivates some of its characters' actions, such as the friendship that arises between Chet and the neighbor who reminds him of his love when more young, or when Bryce's father falls silent when he sees the promising musicians, making it clear that it was the life he left behind to support his family, it is as if these individuals were, in a way, stuck in the past, ironically, in this period film. And this affects us too, we want to be trapped there too, not exactly at the time, but in the phase of life portrayed, where things were easier, where the height of our afflictions was when we would have our first kiss.Even though the film touches on more mature issues like economic hardship, class conflict, disability and parental regret, it's a much sweeter story suitable for all ages than ""Stand by Me."" And though it quickly evolves into a new take on the old boy-meets-girl premise, ""Flipped"" begins innocently enough as an ""awkward Flipped"" story when Bryce Loski (Callan McAuliffe) moves into the house across the street from Lovely but tireless Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll). However, rather than relying on the safe combination of '60s American Bandstand hits and warm-toned, static cinematography, Reiner shows respect for his young audience by illustrating the differences in background, perspective, and the separate hormonal rollercoasters experienced by its main characters. Sentimental without being corny, ""Flipped"" uses the feeling of nostalgic purity in a way that doesn't neglect the importance of a solid foundation in plot and characters to appeal to contemporary children. This one is much more tender and reflective than most child-centric films. An honest and timeless story about boy meeting girl and all the ups, downs, misunderstandings and memorable lessons that come along with it, ""Flipped"" is a captivating film well worth seeing.Enjoying the complexity of contradictory feelings and generational issues, we experience the film visually through the eyes and aurally through the teenagers' narrated thoughts, through one-at-a-time interpretations of key events that occur in their changing relationship over the course of a few years. Director Rob Reiner's bold adaptation of Wendelin van Draanen's emphasizes the vital lesson that not only are there at least two sides to every story, but also that it is impossible to fully understand another person's ""side"" without putting yourself in their shoes. Winner of the Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award, this work that appeals to several generations reaffirms Rob Reiner's role as a director of actors. The young cast members are supported every step of the way by Anthony Edwards as a bitter father, John Mahoney as a widowed grandfather who feels that Bryce's relationship with the girl across the street may echo what he shared with his real deceased love, along with good performances from Penelope Ann Miller, Aidan Quinn and Rebecca DeMornay.""Flipped"" is a film that avoids clichés and stereotypes typical of teen films. Instead, he addresses deeper issues, such as social and family differences, and the importance of understanding another's point of view. It's a story about growing up, learning to see beyond appearances and discovering the true meaning of love.","

"FLIPPED","fredrikgunerius","2 January 2024","Rob Reiner returns to his roots in this simple coming-off age romance about two neighbouring kids growing up on each side of a typical suburban American street in the late 1950s. The title, Flipped, refers to both a development in the male protagonist and to the film's clever narrative style, in which the set of events are told twice, alternatingly from the boy's and the girl's point of view. This may feel exhausting at first glance, but the formula grows on you, and Reiner knows how to utilize the opportunity it creates to sprinkle the story with amusing observations and angles. The story itself is simple, a classic tale of youth and love, but as Reiner rediscovers the at times magical atmosphere from films such as Stand By Me and couples this with beautiful cinematography and sympathetic performances from a fine acting ensemble, Flipped is able to stand out from the crowd and ultimately evoke real emotion despite its somewhat predictable outcome. It's a pleasant film with its heart in the right place. The only thing that doesn't work quite as well as one could have hoped, is the dialogue, which doesn't always seem adjusted for the 1950s.*Review written in 2011.","

"FLIPPED","saadgkhan","19 December 2010","FLIPPED – CATCH IT ( B+ ) Flipped is a simple, charming & adorable story about two teens in a he-said she-said style where both characters alternately presents their perspective on a shared set of events. I loved the whole idea; it brought the utmost needed freshness to teens movies. Its really sweet how the movie progresses and in the beginning Boy ""Bryce"" (Callan McAuliffe) running away from Julie (Callan McAuliffe) though as the time passes by Julie starts to cut off from Bryce & Bryce falls head over heels for her. The best part of the movie was Two sides of the story, that's how we know what was actually happening in both teens head while certain seats of events were happening. I have never seen anything like that before and it was really fascinating for me. Callan McAuliffe and Madeline Carroll brought the utmost freshness on screen. Callan McAliffe and Madeline Carroll are defiantly the stars of tomorrow. They were sweet, lovable and adorable, if we couldn't relate to the characters the movie would have fallen on its face because obviously it's all about emotions, thoughts and feeling on very simple story line. Morgan Lilly as young Julie was the cutest thing on planet. All the supporting cast was simply great and the cinematography was awesome. There were few little things here and there which could have been better, for example I didn't find Bryce's mother very convincing as an actress plus in the entire movie the Julie waits & dreams about kissing Bryce but that kiss never happens though in the end Julie did say ""that he was still walking around with her first kiss, but not for long"" but still if they would have shown the kiss, it would have more impact. Nonetheless few flaws here and there it was one of the most charming movies of 2010 and I can't wait to see it again.","

"FLIPPED","KnightsofNi11","13 July 2011","After a less than impressive run of films from 1999 to 2005 I think Rob Reiner may be gaining back some of his lovable and charming talent he laid out in the 80's. Flipped is his most recent effort and it is a nostalgic look at the simpler times of a complicated adolescence. The film is told through the perspective of two eighth graders who begin to have feelings for each other after a long and complicated relationship that began in second grade. Part of the story will be told through the eyes and narration of Bryce Lovski and then we will see the same events reoccur from the perspective of Juli Baker. The film is practically overflowing with nostalgia, but it is also a sincerely heartwarming tale of love and growing up.My perception of the early 60's time period seen here has formed solely through movies I've seen and stories I've heard, but I really do feel like Reiner has captured the positive side of this time period so well. He combines it with the innocence of adolescence along with the complexity of growing up and has made a film that feels very personal and obviously means something to Reiner. And I feel like the emotions which this nostalgia brought about in him were transferred excellently to me and I felt a kind of honest sincerity coming through the atmosphere of this film.What's so pleasantly satisfying about this film is its utter devotion to its story. It tells such a meaningful and human tale of two lovable characters. This is a movie that tells the age old story of two unlikely people falling in love, but with such a unique twist. The narrative is different and fleshes out the story very well, and the story is not just a love story. It's a story about growing up and it emphasizes the influence of those around us. Flipped has a great supporting cast of characters, all different and special. They all influence our two main characters in their own ways, all possessing some sort of meaningful life lessons or words of wisdom. This is a pattern that is a little melodramatic but fits in place with this coming of age tale in a way that doesn't make it seem ridiculous or forced.This is a film that fits a specific kind of mood. It's sweet but idealized, honest but preachy. But it delivers what it has to offer in respectful moderation so I don't feel like I'm having emotional responses crammed down my throat. Flipped is a film we've seen before but not like this. The funny thing is I really didn't want to love this film, and yet I couldn't help myself. Rob Reiner films are becoming my guilty pleasure with films like this, The Bucket List, and When Harry Met Sally. I have to confess that I enjoyed Flipped so much. It is a very well done film with enough charm and wit to put a heartwarming smile on anybody's face.","

"FLIPPED","mieriks","6 October 2023","This movie, about two eighth-graders who start to have feelings for each other despite being total opposites, is a great romance movie!It was mostly good in terms of technical aspects. Some lighting issues here and there, but I really enjoyed the camerawork. The production design, which took us back to the 50s and 60s, was convincing.The story is the essential element here. The story isn't worth much without good actors, and the actors were very impressive. They convinced us with their performances and they pulled you right into their moments. I'm not sure if I was too satisfied with how the movie told the story of a sequence twice, one by Julianna ""Juli"" Baker and one by Bryce Loski. It was obvious that the movie tried to show the perspective from both of the characters, but it kind of felt repetitive and unnecessary sometimes because it wasn't difficult to guess what the other character felt when we got the perspective of the first character. I think this technique would have fit more in a complex and psychological story. However, since the story itself was the strong part, it never got boring. It's a cute child story about first love and family relationships that highlights the importance of not just the cover, but also the inside that determines the whole package. These elements are relatable to all of us, and it can truly remind you of the important things in life.This is a charming romance movie about two eighth-graders who fall for each other despite their differences. The story is told through the perspectives of both characters, which can be repetitive at times, but the story itself is strong and engaging.

Rob Reiner has directed so many terrific movies (The Princess Bride, When Harry Met Sally, Stand By Me, The Bucket List ...) that my hopes were high for this one - but what a letdown.The plot is cheaply melodramatic, and the acting (despite a strong ""name"" cast) is shallow and uninteresting, The usually excellent Anthony Edwards does a paint-by-numbers portrayal of an angry dad. Only John Mahoney, who played the dad on ""Frasier,"" is worth watching from an acting standpoint.The story is painted in such broad and simplified strokes (by both the screenwriters and the actors) that I can only conclude this movie was intended for young teenagers. I wish that had been mentioned in the promotional blurb, so my wife and I wouldn't have wasted an hour and a half watching it (she feels the same way). We kept thinking that the ""good"" parts of the movie must be coming later ... but they never arrived.If you are older than about 13, I strongly recommend you steer clear of this piece of claptrap.","

At first I liked how each kid gave their own perspective of the events that unfolded, but ultimately this became cliche, repetitive, and ridden with fowl language. The two teens and most of the adult cast are fine actors - but this was a poorly executed project.Teenage boy meets a girl next door in the 1950s and his feelings aren't solidified.

"FLIPPED","u-18005","28 March 2023","The director of ""Flipped"" is ingenious in everyone's characterization . Every character in the film is very distinct , and the film characters are not absolutely perfect , even everyone has their own defects , and it is because of these defects that we feel these characters vivid and real . ""Some of us get dipped in flat , some in stain , some in gloss . But every once in a while you find someone who's iridescent , and when you do , nothing will ever compare . That's what I remember most from this movie . It seems to tell the ignorant love story between a young man and a young girl, but in fact it is more to show the best side of humanity in front of the audience. We can see that there are a lot of contradictions and disputes in the film, but that doesn't stop the director from trying to keep warm love throughout the film. On the contrary, these contradictions and disputes make the theme of the film more profound. I think, no matter in which century, love is an eternal theme. ""Flipped"" this film says that love is not only the love we see the hero and heroine of love, the range of love is very large, heartache is not only people, perhaps is a kind of taste, a kind of feeling.......
This ""flipped"" is not love at first sight , just a moment of heart resonance, soul tremor. It suddenly happened, may also suddenly disappear, leaving only the taste of the heart of the moment. It is difficult to say that the occurrence of ""flipped"" is easy to say. Art needs to be pious, honest to oneself and sincere to others. Such artistic creation can make oneself and others ""flipped"". Juli Baker in the film is because of such a frank and undisguised character, to attract Bryce, and also won the love of Bryce's grandfather. If we were like Bryce's dad in the movie, we might never have the ""flipped"" feeling, and without it, our creation would be lifeless. In addition, in the film, when Julie Baker tells Bryce that she thinks sycamores are beautiful, Bryce dismisses her. She said to Bryce, ""I pity you for not being able to see beauty."" Indeed, art comes from life. Are we sensitive enough to capture the beauty in our lives? Can we perceive? Can you have a ""flipped"" with every bit of life?","

This is a great piece of scripting, directing and editing, as you see significant events between the two twice. Once through the eyes of each with often different recollections. The younger Juli is played charmingly by Morgan Lily. The older one, around 13-14 played by Madeline Carroll steals the show. Carroll has true acting chops and one would hope that there will be opportunities for her in Hollywood. Callan McAuliffe is an absurdly handsome young man as Bryce, Juli's obsession. He conveys Bryce's feelings well and he takes you back to that age convincingly. He is a confused adolescent, trying to fit in and please everybody. The rest of the cast is first-rate led by old pro John Mahoney of ""Frazier"" as Bryce's grandfather. Juli's parents are played nicely by Aidan Quinn and Penelope Ann Miller. Bryce's mom is Rebecca DeMornay and his unlikable dad is played well by Anthony Edwards. How nice to see a movie with characters I care about. A nice little yarn.","

It can get tiring every now and then, but for the most part it works, highlighting how feelings get in the way and alter our perception of reality - kinda what happens to Tom in (500) Days of Summer and to the viewer with him, as we see events only from his unreliable perspective.","

I suddenly discovered that if I was twelve or three years old, I could not help but think that this girl was probably ""ill"". A girl climbing such a tall tree was dangerous and rude. I think I would also talk to her friends around me and hate her, but I would not understand her. You see, how ironic, I think the girls in the film are beautiful and romantic, and the boys are mediocre and boring, but if this plot does not happen in the movie but in life, I will become as distasteful as a boy girl.

I saw a part of myself in there, and I'm sure viewers will somehow relate to the film as well. We all fell in love; some of us very young, some even a little late. But the point is you fell in love the first time and you won't forget the feeling . . . ever.And what makes Flipped even more beautiful is that shines a light on family. It somehow explains why parents behave like they do, why some of them are cold and bitter, forgiving and kind.Flipped is a feel-good movie sure to give you a trip down memory lane.","

As shown through the beginning of the film, they develope feelings for each other and go through events.In Flipped, we follow through Juli and Bryce's narrations. Story's told from their perspective. The writers perfectly presented how a teenager's (or in this case, teenagers) mindset of falling in love is like.Now it does become draggy towards the second act, in which it feels like a family movie more than a romance one. The narration could also be reduced a little. On a technical aspect though, Flipped is a well crafted picture with the decent direction and unique colour-grading.Despite some minor flaws, Flipped is still a warm little entertainment.

He did after all direct Stand By Me which is probably the daddy of coming of age stories.As in the title, what I liked about this film was when it 'Flipped'. We'd first get Bryce's take on something that happens after which the same series of events would be told by Juli. It's a simple story - girl likes boy, boy doesn't like girl and only realises he does just after the girl begins to not like him. It's nothing new or original but it told with a simplistic charm and works wonders thanks to the two leads and outstanding supporting cast.This is a nice film. One of the type that will put you in a good mood and make you long (if you don't already have it) for a true love story of your own. My only complaint is the running time which seems way too short. There's so much build up to the inevitable between Bryce and Juli that when it comes, that's it - end of film.I'd like to think that a sequel could be made to continue the story but it probably won't happen.","

"FLIPPED","jackwriter-82633","17 February 2023","Flipped is filmed in Southwest Michigan and takes place in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Two grade schoolers, sweet Juli and the two-faced jerk Bryce, live across the street from each other, go to the same school and are in the same classes. They ride bikes, climb trees and as a throw-back to the previous generation Juli has chickens and sells the fresh eggs to her neighbors do for 60 cents a dozen.Well, as one who also grew up in Southeastern Michigan in the 1960s, I can relate to just about every aspect of this fine tale. The fact that it is directed by one of my contemporary sociopolitical heroes, Rob Reiner, makes my appreciation for Flipped all the more satisfying. Watch this movie. If you have a heartbeat, you'll enjoy it.","

"FLIPPED","javierbaron2008","12 December 2023","It took thirteen years for me to come across this beautiful film that tells how first love is built.It is the story of Juli and Bryce; since they become neighbors and schoolmates in elementary school, their transition to teenagers and the consolidation of their love in high school.A premise that has been told any number of times. It is the mastery with which the narrative is developed that makes it unique and endearing.All events are told from both perspectives. It is very fun to see how a situation can be perceived in such different ways.As in any worthwhile romance, this one simmers for several years while we get to know their respective families.Rob Reiner's hand is noticeable. Creator of the memorable: When Harry Met Sally. He has the ability to capture a relationship with ups and downs over several years without resorting to clichés or corniness. He shows how after physical attraction it is the personalities that end up falling in love beyond the person's appearance.","

Went blindly for it putting my complete faith on my sister's recommendation which mostly would be great. And then it was altogether a heavenly feel. Was a bliss, every dialogue and the importance of each character and the emotional touch that binds everything together has been done brilliantly. It never happens but I loved the movie so much that I saw it twice back to back without a break. Most movies have a fixed plot but the drama is a genre where the director can explore things way beyond the story and give serious importance to granular emotions. This kid love story is no way lesser than the masterpiece trilogy ""Before Sunrise...."". This is one of the best feel-good movies that anyone would love irrespective of age and taste. It sometimes feels like the IMDb that once was alive before 6 years is completely messed up now. There is no correct way to differentiate good movies from the bad ones when the superhero movies usually get 7 and above rating. This one should definitely be an 8 pointer and above, also surely deserves a strong place in TOP 250 when ""Inside Out"" can be in.","

The way the emotions of both sides of coin ( the boy and the girl) have been portrayed is very connecting. At all point of time while watching the movie one can actually put herself/himself in the shoes of the characters. Family ties, childhood notions, societal upbringing and school for teenagers have actually been brought to life.A must watch for audience appreciating deep emotions reflected via a common man's life. Its a dive into everyone's childhood dreams. A reflection of how children learn, grow and love truly. Callan and Madeline have given a clean soul to the characters visualized by Rob Reiner.

The trailer reminded me a little of when I was a kid and first watched the film Stand By Me which is still one of my all time favourites, maybe it was just the music. I decided to watch Flipped because I've seen every other film thats been released over the past few years and felt I'd ran out of options of decent films to watch so thought what the hell it can't hurt to give this a try. As I began to watch the film I was drawn into the magic of the story like I was a part of it. I could imagine myself at that age and lots of happy memories began to flow back and perhaps some regrets too, things I wished I'd done at a younger age but was now too late. I loved how the film flipped from each perspective giving me an insight into one another's thoughts. I quickly realised that this film was one of the best feel good films I'd seen in along time, one which I'll enjoy talking about and recommending to my friends for a while and surely a film I'll never forget. I can't describe it other than the film has a magic feel to it that one doesn't see in films anymore. The director and everyone who took part in making this did an excellent job and the acting was superb. I hate to admit but I enjoyed the film so much my eyes began to water a little, sad I know but inside I feel happy enough to write this review to spread the word of how truly magnificent the film really is. Watch with your partner or alone, either way you'll be happy you didn't give this film a miss... Enjoy!Long live the sycamore tree! :)","

She has strong opinions and is a good person, but the kind of person you just don't want to cross. She has no grey and is merciless about truth and justice. Our boy hero is a normal boy, eager to have a comfortable life and will go with what was the easiest way to live, lie or adjust, or be quiet in the face of injustice - in short, he is like all of us. The other characters are equally fun to be around - they have all been etched beautifully, with the quiet goodness of Juli's parents with their struggles, genteel poverty due to the choices they have made.

"FLIPPED","mdebono75","23 October 2012","What a wonderful journey into a child's world - or I should say children's' worlds. This movie makes one appreciate the innocence and spontaneity of children and how adults can either foster this creativity or block it. It is a deep movie which gives meaning to appreciating the simple things in life, and not take things for granted. It is also an example of how children can often be the real teachers rather than the other way round. It is an example of how being open to others' differences may lead to opening new doors and how bitter and lonely can some people become when they are set in their own ways. I thought the way the narration switched between the 2 child protagonists, was brilliant. We always want to hear both sides of a 'love' story, and this film gives you that. This is not just a story of love at first sight, but it is a chance to ponder on different characters who represent the persons' next door. Who ever seems strong may be weak, and who ever seems cuckoo may be the trend setter. ""To each his own"" - Who are we to judge?","

The presentation of the movie is so practical and the expression of love at a tender age has been brought about in such intricate detail, it can very well question the understanding of love we adults claim to have.Each scene has been given the right amount of time and attention in a relaxed pace without making the story look either stuck anywhere or rushed towards the end. Since it has been given a narrative structure, almost every major event in the story is shown from both Juli and Bryce's perspectives, giving the audience total freedom to decide which side they relate more to. Family conflicts, problems often faced by middle-class households, and social differences prevalent in the society have been very sensitively showcased.Some more scenes describing the kind of relationships Juli and Bryce had with their respective siblings could have made the story fuller.

Lets see: The movie isn't bad. It brings a lot of nostalgia of that bitter-sweet moment we all had as children: our first love. All the happy moments and all the emotional roller-coaster that came with it. My problem are the voice overs. The ENTIRE movie format is based on them. We're already seeing whats happening so we don't need the protagonists explaining it to us. Maybe some small bits would've worked. But not every single step. Not the full time. It gets tedious. If you can bypass that, then the movie isn't too bad.","

"FLIPPED","user1089r","24 December 2010","Reviewed from DVD.No interactive menu. Navigation problems: each time you start the movie, you must fast-forward through all six commercials, one at a time. No chapters; if you want to reach the spot where you left off, you must fast-forward to it. There are subtitles, but the English ones are thoroughly hidden: surprisingly, you must hover over ""Español"" to see ""English"". And this is a Rob Reiner film? This can turn out to be important (see below).Very lovely video quality. This is simply a very beautiful movie. The protagonist in particular -- also the narrator of the story -- played by Callan McAuliffe, does a fine job, especially for a fourteen-year-old. Unfortunately, this is not the case for his wannabe girlfriend, played by Madeline Carroll, a very unfortunate choice.Since the plot is for the most part pretty drab, it is up to the director and the actors to make up for it, but Ms. Carroll's performance in a prominent role is truly annoying, making the film almost unwatchable, which only adds to the problem. After half an hour, I actually turned on the subtitles and muted the sound, so that I could avoid listening to her voice. It must be said, however, that the teenage girl she played is more than a little aggressive, which only aggravated the problem with her speaking voice.I repeat, this is a visually very beautiful movie; I would even say stunning. If you feel you can somehow tolerate the annoyance of Ms. Carroll's interpretation of the protagonist's girlfriend and the unimaginative storyline, give it a try.","

"FLIPPED","Starlitelet","27 May 2011","I was in the mood for some romantic comedy film and luckily came across Flipped. I was sceptical at first, since the casts are not very known (even though they are young) and I did not see any promotions of movie. So I decided to watch the trailer. I caught a glimpse of Callan McAuliffe. He looked awfully familiar until I remembered seeing him in I Am Number Four. I Am Number Four was not a memorable movie, but I remember that Callan McAuliffe caught my attention more than Alex Pettyfer. Acting:I was curious to see how much Callan would be able to offer to Flipped. Needless to say, he stole my heart. A child actor (he was 15 at that time) was able to make me reminisce and feel nostalgic about my childhood crushes. He did not do much, but his simple emotions and gestures gave so much depth to his character, Bryce Loski. He was so pure and innocent, yet trouble minded. This guy can definitely act. He successfully wins the hearts of the audience. His performance is on the same level as Madeline Carroll, who is Juli Baker, his puppy love. They both go hand in hand because when they are alone, you feel their pain or happiness. However, when they are together, they shine even more. Juli plays the witty and adventurous girl with just the right amount of purity. I am amazed by their acting because their acting seemed so real and genuine.As for the other actors, they did not make the movie better. I was not astound by any of their performances because anyone could have played them, really. Their roles did seem realistic and allowed the storyline to flow smoothly. 9.5/10Storyline:The plot is extremely simple, yet beautiful. It seemed a little too simple for me when I saw the trailer. It is like the boy having this crush on his next door neighbour and they start blooming. Nevertheless, it was much more magical than this. Even though the plot still remained simple like how I originally thought of it, there was a huge pathos factor attached to it. I really believe it is hard to create these type of genres and make the audience feel attached to the characters. It takes a huge amount of work for the actors and director. I really liked how we saw from both of their perspectives. In other words, they played the same scene twice to show each other point of view. It definitely did not get redundant, and I thought it was the one of the film's strong points.There were some minor cons that I thought could have made the movie better. Like, they should have delved more into Uncle Daniel. That being said, there should be more development between the two families and why they are like that. There were moments where I asked a lot of why and how questions. One of them being why did Mr.Loski have apathy on the Baker's family. Entertainment:On a side note, Flipped reminds me of 5 centimetres per second. It is a beautiful anime movie. Not many people appreciate the movie because it is too simple and boring. However, I enjoyed that anime and perhaps that is why I enjoyed or loved Flipped. They carry a lot of emotions and depth on a different dimensions. In other words, not everything is explained in black and white. Emotions cry louder than words. These two literatures delve into the main character's development in life in such a realistic manner that most people can relate to. It has probably happened to us. This is no typical comedy movie, but it was way better than the sappy comedies I have seen recently. It made me smile and sad at the same time. I think this is appropriate or should be appreciated by any age group. It makes adults reminisce, whereas teenagers get a glimpse of what love is about. I hope to see more movies like this one!9.5/10","

This movie came out just last year, and it's now one of my favourite movies. For a movie to get into my 'Favourite movies list' it has to have great acting, a believable storyline, characters that make you feel a connection with them and most importantly, the ability to make me think. To have this movie make it onto that list alongside titles like The Shawshank Redemption, The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas and Little Miss Sunshine, well then, this movie is amazing.The two leads are about 15 and 16 this year, which is roughly my age. I'm going to tell you the truth, I really do not like the new face of Hollywood. The acting is blunt and the actors aren't being the characters. However, McAuliffe and Carroll have brought their respective characters' personalities out. They've put it out for all to see and sympathise with, taking the audience on a beautiful journey in their lives. I loved the two characters from the very beginning, and was intrigued by how practical and down to earth they were. What I loved was how the storyline unfolded. Both sides of this childhood romance was shown, both parties able to tell their side of the story. Typically, a romance is told in such a way that there's always one victim in the situation, and s/he cries until the other welcomes them back with open arms. Well boo hoo. In Flipped, both Bryce and Juli's sides were told from the first person point of view, which allows the readers to feel for the two characters as though they were part of the romance. The technique used was such a personal one, one which connected the audience with the movie. The audience was allowed a trek inside both their minds, all the while just thinking 'Oh, just get together already!' It made me want to reach into the screen and yell 'Now, elope.'Flipped will forever be on my 'Watch Forever list'. A timeless, innocent romance of two young loves which will be enjoyed by all. A definite 9/10.","

Until l watched it myself,l was deeply moved by this story. The altitude between July and Bryce lead the whole story,and what made me moved was the sincere love between two children that has no profits. This type of love is what l wanted. Beside that,the characters' skill of acting in this movie are also perfect. And in the ending,there is more room for imagination for moviegoers,like whether the first kiss between July and Bryce will happen or not.","

Bryce is cute but this movie has no other redeeming features.Stilted dialogue and stiff performances by all except grandpa. No emotional connection. However, we did love seeing a snake eat a whole egg, crack it in his belly and spit out the shell. Not gross at all but not at all convincing that this snake was actually a pet at home.We like the chickens and the ending because a tree was planted and it was a real sycamore tree. I hope they left it there after the movie.Not worth the $3.99 we spent to rent it.","

It explains the little girl fall in love for the little boy at first sight and to express her love throughout adolescence. What makes me the most impressive is the dreamy scene, the total picture makes me feel very happy and relaxed. The story proceeds in chronological order, with a compact plot that does not drag, and the cohesion is very appropriate. The director uses a dual protagonist perspective to shoot, which can help the audience better understand the theme. The only drawback is that the ending of the story was a bit sudden and ended unexpectedly.","

"FLIPPED","w-15336","3 April 2023","It's a story about growing up,family,self knowledge and the perception of others. All action begins with love,Juli fell in love with Bryce at first sight, so she has a long infatuation and preference for him;Juli's father loves his family and life, so he would rather be down and out than give up his brother, so he loves to describe life with paintings;Juli's two brothers love music, so they pursue their dreams fearlessly. Bryce's father also loves music, so he hates himself for giving up music. This is one of the most important themes:love
Meanwhile,I have seen a lot of different attitudes towards life and the choices people make as they grow up. What impressed me most was Julie's father's statement about whether the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and Bryce's final growth.Julie's father's words let us realize that the cognition of people should not be attracted by the surface of the bright, the inner fullness is the most important.The growth of Bryce is what touched me most. After a series of events, Bryce learned to think by himself and express his ideas bravely, instead of being led by people around him. This is the growth and transformation of a teenager, which deeply touched me.","

The main characters Bryce and Juli are really cute. I was left wondering my days back in elementary school, the teenage love, mood swings, unpredictable behavior and the never ending saga of changes. Although there are some parts that I suppose can add more substance like the character of professor Simon. After watching the movie I was left quietly sitting in our living room area and just stare blankly and I was smiling (sounds crazy but it's true). These are low budget movies with every bit of penny worth it. I give it 10 out of 10 stars as I was deeply happy on the outcome of the film.","

There was no doubt about it that she fell for his beautiful dazzling eyes. But for Bryce she was just a staler. It took 4 years for Bryce to actually understand and accept his love for her. She waited and waited, went through everything alone.. But for Bryce she was someone he wanted to get away from. But realization dawned on him when he hurt her pretty badly. And after getting hurt repeatedly she became distant, maybe got over him. But, he fell oh so deeply in love with her. At last they got together when Bryce planted the sycamore tree for her, one that got cut down, one she loved so fondly. Love comes to us in completely unexpected ways. Not every time we are ready to give in. But true love waits. It flips your heart and you fall oh so deeply in it unknowingly.
This story will take you on a roller coaster of emotions. It'll make you soft to the core. And will make you believe that in any corner of the world there's still the purest form of love.","

What makes it more charming is that it is based in the 1950s and the early 1960s, which adds a hint of class and drama to all the characters. There is a separate genre of coming of age movies, as how one finds him/herself under the various circumstances. But Flipped gives you more sense of things in not so obvious sense. It touches so many aspects of life and connects with you at so many level. The Story uses the teenagers as tools to give you an enlightenment on perspective, prejudice, character, Morality, Love and Life. The movie stays with you and will leave a smile every time you will hear the word ""Flipped"".","

I liked the switching of points of views between Bryce and Juli. This gave the movie an extra niche. The kids and their parents both played their role excellently well. Each character played its own part in building the character of the two kids. The role played by John Mahoney was important and critical for the story too. This movie can be very touching .

"FLIPPED","mdlcbfla","11 June 2011","The premise had such promise, and the structure (alternating perspectives) was a great way to tell the story. I have to blame it on the director. There's no way this many halfway decent (or better) actors could turn in such superficial performances. The family yelling scenes are pathetically bad, no nuance at all, suited for film-making 30+ years ago. Everything the Anthony Edwards character does is cringe-worthy and over the top. Look at the gestures the characters make. It's like nothing was suggested to tone down the melodrama. Only Madeline Carroll shows exceptional acting ability, and even that is not consistent. Also, listen to the diction in the dialog. This was supposed to take place in the early 60s, but the words and phrases used are colloquial from today. It ends up being a cross between an After School Special and something on Lifetime. It's not unwatchable, but only as a last resort.","

The way the film is structured and narrated from each protagonist makes it even more heartwarming. It is unexpectedly different, original even, in comparison to the regurgitated romantic comedy movies that have no depth. It is a movie for all ages as Flipped explores each family member and I assure you, you can definitely relate to one of them in someway and feel comfortable and warm watching this movie. I fell in love with the cast, each actor fitted in their roles perfectly.It has its funny moments, cute, heart-throbbing and sad moments; it's Truly Wonderful, Original and sweet.

"FLIPPED","tragedydq","30 November 2016","First of all, I love this movie so much and I would like to appreciate Rob because he reminds me of my first love via this movie. The movie is processing with two main characters – Juli and Bryce. Juli is a very beautiful girl: Long chestnut hair, big green eyes, like a melted ice cream in the summer. However, she is pretty naughty. She is ready for a relationship when she is 7 and she even hit the newspaper's headline because of hampering her neighbors cutting the tree. She is entangled his new neighbor which is a little handsome boy Bryce. Bryce doesn't like to stay with Juli and so does his father Steven. Steven thinks Juli seems to be too animated and he hates Juli's father too! Steven thinks Richard is a jerk because of his ugly painting and ugly courtyard. In short, Juli's family is a freak in the neighborhood. With the age growing up. Juli and Bryce's life are slowly and subtly changing. Their views of the each other and also the world are changing too. In this process, Bryce's grandfather Chet plays an important character. He is the first guy to helps Bryce finds Juli's unique and helps Juli in obscurity. Moreover, the most interesting thing of the story is that the director uses the linear narrative mode, it also has a sub-mode of repetition and contrast. In this way, I can clearly feel the difference, contradictions, gaps between the boys and girls. It just sent me back to when I was young and reminding how much I avoided girls and how many tricks that I put on them.My favorite part of the film is the experiences of the main character's growth. Most of the coming of age genre movies are event driven not personality driven, the psychological changes and behavioral choices are often driven by some sudden events. However, Flipped describes the processing of the growing and maturing in the daily life. Juli doesn't love thinking since she was young. She realizes the beauty's difference of the appearance and the inherent when she pursuits the true beauty. Bryce also becomes a warrior from a cowardly kid step by step. Rob leads us to flip from Juli's view to Bryce's view to shows us the true nature of their friendship and love, their love and respect to each other and ends this story with a lovely and sweet ending. All in all, I enjoyed this movie and would like to recommend it!","

Then again, I love and admire almost all of Rob Reiner's work. He achieves to imprint a soul to the story and their characters in his movies (rare to find in an American reel), blurring the gap I feel there is in the way of telling a story (regarding European approaches e.g.), and gets the best of both worlds with a true original. If I ever get into this business as I've been dreaming since my kid years', I would love to follow his example.My deepest thanks to his work, and very best wishes he keeps on making these worth watching films.","

(a mistake on my part, I hadn't paid attention on the DVD cover, and for a European family, the language and the accent of the French-Canadien dubbers is simply horrible, the translation of the original dialogue is too weird for us, scriptwriters write the texts in Canadian-French almost word for word. For exemple : ""for real"" in English become ""pour vrai"" in French-Canadian, but in French from France or Belgium, ""for real"" is translated by : ""pour de vrai ou vraiment !"". So, because of that, the film was, for us, not as so beautiful as it had to have been. It's a cute film, but I will have to see it a second time in the original language to make a real and good review.
And for my friends from French Canada counties, no worries, I love you, I love your accent, I love your expressions so naïve... Then ""Tabernacle"", try to do good translation from English (not a word to word) and you will be great in all over the world for the French people :)

As noted elsewhere, this is a refreshing departure from the standard special effects vehicles. It captures the mood and pace of the 1960s nicely. The alternate perspectives of the two main characters worked well, and the development of the characters is adroitly done. I actually did not recognize Penelope Ann Miller and Rebecca DeMornay until the end credits. This may be because I had not seen either actor in a movie for some years, but also probably equally due to their makeup and clothing. Their portrayal of 1960s housewives was very effective. Overall, visually, this movie does a great job of putting the viewer into the 1960s. Not sure how effective this would be for someone who did not experience the 1960s. Highly recommended.","

Reiner has made some of my favorite movies of all time and shown, perhaps, more diversity than any other director working today (could you get more different than This is Spinal Tap, Stand by Me, The Princess Bride, A Few Good Men, and When Harry Met Sally?). At his best, his films are a home run, and even his worst films were solid base hits, but I guess everyone has to strike out once in a while.As I watched this story unfold in a very straight forward, obvious and uninteresting way, I struck by the uniformly poor acting from everyone (with the possible exception of Mahoney). Then it dawned on me -- it's not the acting, it's the characters. Each was a simple stereotype and barely even 2 dimensional. The actors were doing exactly what was being asked of them and the only fault I can really find with them is their poor choice in choosing this project in the first place. And the worst part of it is that the story itself was not that bad. It was just poorly executed.I have not given up on Rob Reiner as filmmaker. He has given me hundreds of hours of enjoyment over the years. So I'm just going to try to put this clunker he phoned in out of my mind and will go back and watch The American President for the 20th time.","

"FLIPPED","dada1994","26 February 2011","As a big fan of the book, this movie was a major let down to me. I know movies can't include every detail of a book, but some scenes were changed in a way that removed all the emotion the book created. (When Chet told Bryce why his mother was crying and whenever he spoke to him it wasn't as if they never spoke.) When Bryce told him family about the chickens, instead of telling them he didn't actually ask Juli, he simply lied and let them think he did. The fact that the actual story doesn't take place in the late 1950s also makes it completely different. I disliked how Bryce only had lunch with one girl on the day of the auctions. I did not finish watching the movie, but as a person who enjoyed every word of the book, this movie was a major let down.Pros - Juli and Bryce narrating their sides of each story, good technologyCons - strayed away from book too much, Bryce's mom and sister looked too alike (I got them confused and I disliked his mother's hair), being set in a different time (I would understand '90s but '60s is too much).","

Does Flipped compare to other similar Reiner films, like Stand By Me? No. But what Flipped does, it does well. The acting is genuine, and manages to capture a semblance of the timeless facets of youth that seem unburdened by time. Although the film can err on playing out like something out of a 50's TV series, Reiner manages to blend the cutesy kitsch with touching moments that keep this film from turning into a sugary mess. One could argue the film is slow and uneventful, and to a certain extant I agree. Despite this, Flipped manages to intrigue and make you feel all fuzzy inside. 8/10. Great movie!","

Now concerning the movie it's an amazing first- young love and being able to see both sides of their story was and is amazing. I loved that they went above and beyond to follow script of the book but the slight changes aren't kicking you in the face. They change some plots like the basket boys Scene for Bryce and no champ. As well as slight character look differences and conversations can be changed. But a change I liked (spoiler) was the ending of Juli going outside to sit with Bryce and help with planting, it kind of completed it in a way of not feeling as left out on what happens next. So I DO recommend this movie, as I rewatch it a lot and it never gets old!","

But it isnt just the romance, this film also focuses on whats like growing up as a child, what its like when you have arrogant parents or eccentric ones, how to accept and embrace your uniqueness and to never judge a person on their outwards appearance.It will definitely make you a blush with its adorableness but make you feel good with how smooth it is potrayed.","

It's 2023, this is so worth it and I'm glad I watched it even if I'm 13 years late. The storyline is very simple and predictable, with synopsis alone, anyone could already tell where the story. Plot tells a story of teenagers as they discover what's there in life and love. The setting might took place at 1960s but the relativeness of the scenes to any generation doesn't differ that much as we all grow and learn regardless of the age. Most people could relate to atleast one character in the story and maybe atleast once in their life experienced having a crush on someone or being liked by someone. Watching the two perspective is like seeing two sides of the coin and as the story progressed we saw it flipped.","

"FLIPPED","gbrlzander","23 April 2022","The movie flipped is a romantic comedy-drama film about two teenagers, Bryce Loski and Juli Baker played by Callan McAuliffe and Madeline Carroll. Although the actors did a pretty good job the plot was slow and boring.The decor seems a bit like the early 70s or the late 60s but in reality the movie takes place in 1953. I also feel like the way that the people in the movie where talking to modern compared to when the movie takes place, I can excuse this since the movie is made for kids or young teenagers so it would be kind of hard for them to understand if the people spoke in old english. If you are a kid that doesn't really care about details and likes romance then you could maybe like the movie.There was a scene I really didn't like when Juli and her father visit her mentally disabled uncle. The acting of the uncle was excessive and showcased a small minority of how mentally disabled people act, this could make children watching the movie belive that all mentally disabled act this way. The uncle was also in a special place for mentally disabled people which is realistic for the time at which the movie takes place, but I feel like adults should explain too children that most mentally disabled people don't live in those kinds of places anymore.I think that the movie lacks originality with the girl meets boy plot that has been repeated over a hundred times.I got really annoyed by the poor and unrealistic choices of the teenagers during the movie.Overall I am really unimpressed by the movie and I would not recommend for anyone who doesn't like slow movies. The only thing I was impressed with was the actors.","

""flipped"" is a very simple story, but it is very rich. The main story is about children's puppy love. In fact, this movie also tells about pursuing their dreams, respecting, industrious, how to treat poverty, how to accept disabled families, and how to maintain their self-esteem.One detail that impressed me deeply is that after the parents quarreled, they immediately said to the child, ""We will solve it, it's not your fault."" Then they took turns comforting her, indicating that the parents still love each other and reassuring the child. That's why children feel, ""I don't think it's easy for Mom, and I don't think it's easy for Dad, either. But born in this family, I'm lucky."" Loving parents are better than wealthy parents.Continue with ""flipped"". I envy this kind of heroine in American culture, just like the old lady in ""UP"": she has an adventurous spirit, a romantic spirit, a courage to be different, a sense of wisdom and responsibility, a down-to-earth ability to achieve her dreams, a vibrant, loving, loved, healthy body and soul. In our popular culture, the female protagonists are mostly foolish and naive, confused, optimistic, and emotionally rich, waiting for the male protagonist to take pity on them.In a nutshell, the heroine in the United States is a tree, a flowering tree that grows well without a hero;
Our heroine is a flower, a crippled flower, some with tragic experiences and bodies, waiting for a man to save them. Bad love is when you lose the whole world for one person
Good love is when you see the whole world through one personI always want to strive to enrich myself and make myself better than before. I want to be a person with a gorgeous heart in my grandfather's mouth. So that I can meet you with a strong and beautiful
Beautiful Shirley only talks about tents and food. And Julie, who is not very attractive, can join the conversation of ""perpetual motion machine"" at will .This is not to say that face is not important to girls .The same sentence should be used to attract others with the appearance of beauty to discover your inner beautyRather than seeing your emptiness and ignorance as people get closer to you.A girl like Julie is really cute with a kind heart that understands beauty and life. Climb a tall tree and watch the sunrise and sunset. Think about the whole that is larger than the part. She said to Bryce that there's no room for beautiful things in your eyes. I sympathize with you. The infinite beauty of the setting sun seen on the wutong tree
The little wisdom and subtle details embodied throughout the film also add color to itWho would have thought that a boy's secular, rude, and mean father had a musical dream when he was a teenager
Life is like a ruthless knife that has changed our appearanceGrandfather exists as a bridge to guide boys to communicateI like his white hair and sideburns, showing a wise and uncommon temperament
What an extraordinary woman is that grandmother who is always mentioned by him
A kind girl mother who supports a poor family with loveAlways have a warm expectation for a better lifeThe alternation of psychological activities between boys and girls is also ingeniousThe pounding heart is enough to tell this sweet story of adolescence.","

From another point of view, Bryce's family atmosphere is not good, his father looks down on Julie's family and even everything about Julie. A father's influence on his children is huge, I think in this kind of education, Bryce is not a good match for Julie. The logic of this movie is not sound. I think the reason that Julie falls in love with Bryce is too far-fetched. A pair of sparkling eyes is not worthy of her love again and again.","

The movie is unfolded through rhe two characters,making people surprised.In the meantime,I really like how the story shows. The overall painting style of the film is very fresh and beautiful,and it is easy to immerse people in it. Bryce gradually approached and fell in love with Julie from the beginning through resistance. This process is also a signal of his own inner transformation.Although the plot of the movie is a bit old-fashioned, it still tells the people a lot of truth. For example, it is necessary to look at a person with heart, communicate promptly when encountering difficulties, and not discriminate against vulnerable groups.","

Only in love can we maintain a self-awareness,self- awareness. Only if you love yourself enough can you be treated gently in love.2, only two people mutual equality, mutual independence, look up to each other, toward thedirection of the sky, grow together, is the truelove. Only from this love can we calmly andsteadily be confident and gentle and grow. I wish that people could see what is beautifulwithout experiencing pain. But reality is cruel,sometimes we have to go through pain to learn what's precious. In many cases, the priceof knowing is too heavy. We shine separately, but we shine together.40, Love dies out if it is too dependent, too contrblled, too humble. But no matter how theoutcome, we must first learn to forgive in love,because good love, make people grow up!","

Bryce hated Julie, but had to be a gentleman while doing everything he could to keep her away. After all, in the eyes of his family and his family, the person named Julie not only looks ordinary, but also does not have the right ""lawn"" for him. Everything has come to a ridiculous pace.Julie's father, a painter, told her that looking at a person is like looking at a painting, you can't just look at some simple part of it, and a painting is more than the sum of its parts.Look at the whole picture. It's dangerous to look at the parts, to look at the whole, to seek the beauty of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. Julie didn't quite understand what her father had said. She just enjoyed climbing up to a sycamore tree in the school bus waiting area for a view. Up there, you get a different view.Until one day, she had to climb up high in the plane tree to pick up the kite, that day, she was fascinated by the scenery. Julie began to think about what her father had said, and she began to notice people she met at school. She found that the sum of the parts was always greater than the whole in almost all people, except for Bryce. She could not read him, she thought. Julie finally realized that Bryce was a coward at heart, with gorgeous looks, bright eyes, and a charming smile. She knew that all along it was just her not wanting to ""see"" -- that the whole of Bryce was less than the sum of its parts. She was relieved. And Bryce, who was left out in the cold

"TOY STORY","bob the moo","22 April 2003","Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence.Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula.The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz's turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads.Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It's hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.  The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors. Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz. Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults.Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things!","

"TOY STORY","ccthemovieman-1","18 February 2007","This is a very clever animated story that was a big hit, and justifiably so. It had a terrific sequel and if a third film came out, that would probably be a hit, too.When this came out, computer technology just was beginning to strut its stuff. Man, this looked awesome. Now, it's routine because animation, which took a giant leap with this movie, has made a lot more giant strides.The humor in here, however, is what made this so popular. There are tons of funny lines, issued by characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and John Ratzenberger, among others. As good as Hanks is as ""Woody"" and Allen as ""Buzz Armstrong,"" I think the supporting characters just about stole the show: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc.Multiple viewings don't diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too. This is a guaranteed ""winner"" as is the sequel.","

"TOY STORY","philip_vanderveken","25 December 2004","I am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the Pixar Studios. They are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies, creating movies that are more than just worth a watch, even when they were made a decade ago.The movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. When the young boy's birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don't want to be ignored when the new one arrives. Woody the cowboy is their ""leader"" because he's the most popular one of them all. He's the only one that hasn't got to be afraid, but than a new favorite arrives ... Buzz Lightyear. He hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him, but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other...When you see Toy Story, you may think that the different human like characters (Woody the cowboy for instance) aren't always as perfect as we are used to see in todays animated movies. Perhaps that's true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren't yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. I give it an 8.5/10.","

"TOY STORY","MovieAddict2016","21 February 2003","Toy Story – 5/5 starsChildren play with toys. It is a known fact. At one time or another, we all played with toys, whether they were action figures, dolls, little green soldiers, etc But what if toys were real? What if they could talk?Pixar and Disney serve us this theory in what was the first full-length computer-animated film ever, 'Toy Story,' chronicling the events in the life of a cowboy doll, Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks).Woody is the favorite toy of his owner, a small child named Andy. Andy brings Woody everywhere, and cherishes him, as we see in the beginning of the film. However, this all changes on Andy's birthday when Andy gets a new toy: a Buzz Lightyear doll (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody is suddenly forgotten, left with the rest of his friends: Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney, better known as Ernest) and Ham (see if you can guess the voice of this one? I'll give you a hint: 'Cheers'). But after Buzz accidentally gets knocked out an upstairs window, Woody is the prime suspect. Now, after Woody and Buzz end up next door, in toy killer Sid's house, Woody must prove his innocence by getting both Buzz and him back to Andy's house safely.'Toy Story' builds on an element we all shrug off carelessly and thoughtlessly. Much like they did last year with monsters under the bed, Pixar took the theory of live toys to a new level in 'Toy Story,' filling our minds with endless possibilities.What Pixar does is a strange thing. It doesn't just try to expand our mind, but also out world. I respect and enjoy that. In 'Monsters, Inc.,' Pixar managed to preach to us 'What if monsters under the bed are real, and what if they have a world much like ours, and have feelings like humans,' while never forgetting the equally important formula of humor. Much is the same with their earlier film 'Toy Story.' What if those wooden and plastic toys we all played with as kids are real? What if they have feelings, emotions, voices, and human qualities? An interesting idea by itself, but when mixed with a wicked sense of humor and reality, you've got yourself one of the best films ever.Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody. Pixar must have modeled the doll's expressions and movements after Hanks, because after a while, I feel like I AM watching Hanks on screen, and NOT a computer-generated image. When you get to the point of not being able to tell animation from reality, you know that the voices are good.The same goes for Tim Allen, though the body gestures were most likely not modeled after Allen's physical expressions (Buzz is a short, pot-bellied toy).The rest of the cast is excellent, all very believable and entertaining. You begin to love each character for their distinguishing traits, and that is always refreshing.I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films. The only film they made that I named forgettable was 'A Bug's Life,' which was in and of it not horrible, but lacking the sense of humor the other Pixar films have and had.Pixar makes very refreshing films. In an era of cheap, made-for-video Disney sequels, rip-off cartoons and television babysitters (i.e. 'The Jungle Book 2), Pixar holds true to the values that made Disney films so entertaining back in the 30's-60's: Respect for the audience's intelligence, humor, provocative ideas to base the film upon, and respect for the audience (not the exact same thing as the first element), all of which are forgotten in this day and age of money-makers. I respect Pixar very much, and after hearing how little Disney does in helping with their films, I feel that Disney is just trying to cash in on their ideas by having their name branded on the posters for Pixar films. Shame on you, Disney. Proof that Disney has no respect for audiences is the fact that they will not let another sequel be made – something that fans like me would rather have than something like 'Finding Nemo.''Toy Story' 1 & 2 are both on my 'favorite films' list. It may sound stupid, but if I made up a top 250 list like IMDb.com, both of those films would be on there; so would 'Monsters Inc.' After an unpromising trailer for Pixar's upcoming film 'Finding Nemo,' I think that after their licensing deal with Disney is disputed (they have to cough up five more ORIGINAL films – not sequels – by 2005), they should definitely try to make a 'Toy Story 3.' I'll be first in line for it, anyway.","

"TOY STORY","tieman64","17 November 2009","""I believe that a filmmaker's entire work is contained within his first film; not that it can all be foreseen, but that it can afterwards be verified."" – Francois Truffaut (The Films In My Life) Buzz Lightyear, a glossy action figure with a sexy sheen, is not a mere toy. He's a Space Ranger, tasked with protecting the universe from the evil Emperor Zurg! His life has meaning, he is unique, his existence has grand purpose! Woody, a dated cowboy doll, thinks otherwise. He was once a youthful and exuberant toy, the favourite plaything of his owner Andy, but years of existence have shown him the truth: everyone is just a toy, soon to be forgotten and discarded. No one is unique. There is no grand purpose. No universe to save. Better to be a realist, seeing the world without its fake plastic facade and tacky ipod veneer.Of course Buzz thinks Woody is just a crazy old timer. Doesn't Woody realise that Buzz is a genuine Space Ranger?! That he's a member of the Elite Universe Protection Unit! That he alone has information that reveals Emperor Zurg's weakness! That stupid fool! Naturally, we the audience identify with Woody. Buzz seems like an idiot, brainwashed and in desperate need of identity and purpose. The Elite Universe Protection Unit merely elevates believers into a position of exaggerated importance. This is an idle fantasy, an other-worldly hope adopted by those who can't face the dour reality that is the ""real world of toys"".Midway in the film, our heroes stumble across a horde of green alien toys. These aliens worship a giant claw, a mechanical God which they believe will descend and pluck the ""chosen ones"", taking them to some kind of toy heaven. In reality, the claw chooses only deluded souls, and offers them to the devilish Cid Phillips, a sadistic child who mutilates toys. ""Nirvana is coming!"" the aliens whisper, watching as the ""chosen ones"" are airlifted to their deaths.Buzz Lightyear faces a similar scenario later in the film. Having witnessed a television commercial which advertises a vast range of Buzz Lightyear action figures, Buzz must confront the fact that he really is ""just an ordinary toy"" who ""can not fly"". ""Flying"" thus becomes a sort of Nietzschean metaphor, the ability to transcend the ""flesh"" (in this case, injection moulded plastic) and become ""something more"".Buzz's first reaction upon seeing the commercial is to seek refuge in denial. ""I am not a toy!"" he says to himself, before climbing to the top of a staircase. Seeking to validate himself by flying, by defying the laws of toy-dom, he takes a giant jump – a literal leap of faith – and of course falls promptly to the ground. He can't fly.Cue the fastest existential crisis ever seen in a children's film, Buzz Lightyear promptly falling into a deep depression, his faith completely destroyed. His entire existence was based on a lie, a social framework which indoctrinated him into believing that the fate of the whole universe depended on his actions. How can he continue living? Why do anything? What's the point? And more importantly, how the hell did this become a kid's franchise? It's like a demented cartoon by Philip K. Dick (""Do Plastic Toys Dream of Suicide Switches?"").Then comes the message of the film. Woody tells Buzz that being a Space Ranger doesn't define who he is. His value, status and worth can only be found within the community of toys, on ground level, and not ""up in the skies"". There is no purpose beyond ground zero and our importance lies solely in our ability to bring good to those immediately around us.Buzz heeds Woody's words and quickly gets over his loss of faith. He stages a daring rescue mission, straps a rocket to his back and flies spectacularly in the air, his newfound love for the ""greater good of his family"" quite literally giving him wings.In true Zarathustran fashion, Buzz becomes a pint sized Ubermensch figure, a superman who reaches for the sky but is then brought depressingly back down to Earth. If he would just lower his sights, Woody then says, Buzz would find enough reasons to live. Set free of the ""moral code"" imprinted on him by his makers, Buzz thus adopts a new code which, though it puts limits upon him, negating some of his wild ambitions and reducing him, in an existential sense, to a chunk of plastic, still allows for a Nietzschean war cry. This cry, which Buzz yells every time he jumps across that dark abyss, sums up humanity best: ""To Infinity and Beyond!"" 8.9/10 – With its revolutionary visuals, consistent humour, genuine sense of adventure, memorable characters, slick camera work and a couple action/adventure scenes worthy of George Lucas, ""Toy Story"" is a milestone in cinema, and one of the most influential animated films since ""Snow White"".Most interesting, though, is in observing how Brad Bird reverses Lasseter's themes here with his first Pixar feature, ""The Incredibles"". Brad Bird seems to be the bad boy of Pixar, subverting them from within. Viva la Resistance. Worth multiple viewings.","

"TOY STORY","GeorgeRoots","15 December 2013","With the wonderful collaboration of Pixar and Disney, who as of 2013 have given us some of the most visually impressive and wonderful movies ever made. ""Toy Story"" was the go to film of many childhoods (Including my own), and brought CGI movies into the mainstream with stunning promises & confidence.How things came to be, Lucasfilm sold a portion of their effects company to computer giant Apple (That inevitably became Pixar), who would go on to strike a deal with Disney. Director John Lasseter had lost his job to Disney for pitching the idea of this story, and after the successful development stage he managed to gain back the confidence of Disney, and alas the rest is history.I bring this story up just to reflect how far we've matured in terms of story telling & technology. The idea of adults giving kids morals & entertainment through animation, wonderfully echoes that of what Walt Disney set out to do so many decades ago. Toy Story has aged extraordinarily well for the first CGI film ever made. Held together mostly for its impeccable casting, I feel ashamed now 20+ years old and much more experienced in movies to say I still look at Tom Hanks & Tim Allen, and almost immediately think ""Toy Story"". As well as the stellar supporting cast, its visuals are fantastic and the music is timeless. Writers include a young Joss Whedon, and with a rotten antagonist by the name of Sid, makes this movie just as entertaining now as it was then.Final Verdict: It's hard to find any flaw with such a beloved movie, especially the one now most adults will first show their kids. It has everything to move and touch you deeply, and to believe a bunch of 0's and 1's flying around in digital space can do that, ""Toy Story"" is that proof. 10/10.","

"TOY STORY","dunmore_ego","26 May 2006","Y'know, I always suspected that my toys were coming to life when I wasn't looking! In Andy's Room, his toys lead lives of noisy desperation come every birthday and Christmas - no one wants to be one-upped by a new addition to the toy box. Nominally led by Cowboy Woody (there's a Brokeback joke in there just waiting to happen), Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Ham the piggybank, Bo Peep, Slinky the dog and a smattering of other playthings go about their toy business of playing checkers, hanging with the hometoys and ""plastic corrosion awareness meetings,"" until Andy's birthday party, when they gather expectantly around a transistor radio, listening to the reports of their toy soldier troops ""in the field"" (downstairs watching Andy's gift-opening), hoping that no gift will be exciting enough to cause Andy to neglect *them.* There is. His name is Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger.Directed by Pixar mainstay John Lasseter, with the voice talents of Tom Hanks (as Woody), Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger (forever Cliff from *Cheers*), R. Lee Ermey, Annie Potts, Jim Varney and Tim Allen (as Buzz), *Toy Story* is that *rara avis* that succeeds on all levels  in its animation, storyline, character development, its messages of friendship and self-realization and, most importantly, its entertainment value. The fact that this is a cartoon (or animated feature  just what DO we call this new wave of computer-generated movies?) is incidental. Which makes the slightly dodgy animation (of the ""real people"") irrelevant - it gets the point across with or without the technological finesse.The ""Disney Movie"" has become synonymous with maudlin messages, redneck fundamentalism, anachronistic family values, boneheaded parents, smart-mouthing youngsters, too-hip-to-be-smart teens and insufferable pets. Though Disney's tyrannical umbrella overarches this film's production studio, Pixar Animation, *Toy Story* somehow avoided all trace of Disney's craven hand, which is doubly surprising, considering this is Pixar's first feature length film, after years of experimentation. Right outa the gate and right outa the field.Sure, there are ""messages,"" but they are heartfelt, rather than maudlin (Woody tells Buzz during Buzz's greatest depression that it matters not what Buzz thinks of himself, what makes him important is what his owner, Andy, thinks of him); there are emotional segments, which are truly heartbreaking, rather than cheesy (when Buzz's escape attempt lands him with a broken arm, proving he is Not A Flying Toy, the lyric, ""Clearly I will go sailing no more,"" launches a thousand hankies); and the portrayal of Andy's family was Pixar's triumphal achievement. Boldly contravening Disney's *idée fixe* of the 1950's nuclear family and Norman Rockwell fantasies, one of the many incarnations of a modern-day family is presented: a single mother with two kids, who are neither geniuses nor monsters, just normal children; happy to visit Pizza Planet and disappointed when favorite toys are lost.Buzz  who believes he is a real life space ranger on a mission to save the universe - become Andy's favorite toy over Woody. The funny thing is: though Buzz believes he is real, he still adheres to toy protocol of ""playing inert"" when humans are in the area. (Maybe it's instinct?) When he mentions saving a toy from Sid, the vicious boy next door, how does he propose to do it if he is to adhere to the inert protocol? Buzz's ingenuousness regarding his role as a toy infuriates Woody to the point of attempted toy-assassination. Through a concatenation of accidents, both he and Buzz become lost and must use teamwork, trust and ingenuity to beat their path back to Andy, which finds them ensconced in scorchingly funny vignettes (Buzz fastening himself in an over-sized seatbelt; both falling in with green, three-eyed aliens; Buzz hyperventilating as ""Mrs. Nesbitt""). During a climactic rocket ride, the callback line, ""This is not flying - this is falling with style,"" simply seals this movie's greatness.At least I now have a plausible explanation as to why my toys always got lost: after going about their toy business, they would just go inert anywhere they happened to be, instead of paying attention to their master's infallible toy filing system.","

"TOY STORY","Anonymous_Maxine","20 April 2001","Toy Story is not only the best Disney film because it has the best story and the best animation, but also because of the excellent actors chosen to provide the voices of the animals. The casting was perfect from top to bottom, and the movie provides an excellent adventure story about friendship and loyalty that keeps you engrossed until the nail-biting climax.
Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provided excellent voices for Woody and Buzz Lightyear -their performances alone are one of the biggest things that made this such a spectacular movie. Besides that, though, you have the excellent story that is not only noteworthy because it has never really been told from this perspective before, but also because it was just told so well. All of the characters in the film are very well developed and all have appropriate and effective actors chosen to provide their voices. And of course, who could forget the revolutionary animation! The computer animation used for this movie not only made it startlingly realistic but also opened up tons of possibilities, and thankfully the filmmakers chose to explore these possibilities. There are dozens of things that are hidden in the woodwork throughout the film, as well as in the songs  note, for example, the subtle playing of the Indiana Jones theme song in the scene where Woody knocks Buzz out the window with the desk lamp.
Toy Story is by far the best Disney film ever made, it's pretty much perfect. It's adventurous, it's exciting, it's entertaining, it's good for the whole family, it's got great characters, story, and plot, and above all, it's fun.","

"TOY STORY","Hitchcoc","3 January 2015","What a wonderful integration of classic toys and a superb plot. It's a new height in animation (though things have gotten even more impressive long since). The voicings of Tim Allen as Buzz and Tom Hanks as Woody, with their inherent connection to their toy beings, with an incredible supporting cast, make this a romp to end all romps. There is a strain between the realities of the world and the fact that even though they are sentient beings, they are still toys. Buzz has lights that flash but he can't really fly. Woody has the ludicrous string on his back that allows him to deliver his catch phrases. Then there is the neighborhood villain, Sid, who is a maimer and destroyer of toys. There is the quest for the mishandled and lost. And a finale that is worthy of everything that has been set up. What really makes this work is the ""humanity"" of the characters. There is love and a true connection among them. If you have never seen this, it is worth every minute.","

"TOY STORY","gigan-92","13 December 2010","I remember seeing this film at the ripe age of seven, and I was totally entranced by it. What kid would not have been attracted to that sweet of a premise? Released way back in 1999, it was totally different from the usual hand drawn animation, and yet still as vibrant, if not more so. Even now as an 18 year old dude I find it so amazing. Attention to detail has always been Lasseter's strong suit, among many I might add. But the greatest thing about this film was the life evoked into its unique and untouchable characters.With the voice talents of Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, as well as the hilarious Don Rickles, and the late Jim Varney, the voice acting was perfect and the dialogue was surprisingly intelligent throughout. What could be perceived more or less as a simple story is told with heart and humor, one that hasn't aged a bit since that first viewing. I still own my original VHS copy in fact, but perhaps it's time I buy it on Blu-ray or DVD.","

"TOY STORY","dee.reid","6 September 2005","I'm 19, going on 20 in six days. I don't need to tell you that ""Toy Story"" is a movie tailor-made for the kiddies, but there's a special reservation for adults too. I should know, as should anyone who views it with an open mind. We've all had our favorite toys. For guys, like me, there's a 90% chance you played with either Transformers or G.I. Joe or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or all three when you were six, seven, eight, or nine years-old. For me, it was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Godzilla action figures. I'd always imagine living out wild fantasy adventures in my room or basement; ah, the joy of being a kid again. But that's part of ""Toy Story's"" fun appeal. It gives you a chance to relive your childhood again. Today I saw for the first time in about eight years and it's still just as fresh and inventive as Pixar, probably the best film studio in computer animation, conceived it back in 1995. In the room of young Andy, the toys are alive - when he's not present of course, and cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is the boy's favorite item. But all that changes on Andy's birthday and a new toy given to him on that day captures the boy's heart - Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen). Of course, any replacement of this sort inspires jealousy, and pretty soon Buzz is the new ""it"" item of the bedroom. Andy's given into everything Buzz Lightyear, even new bedsheets - bedsheets! - leaving poor Woody on the short end of the stick. But the thing is, Buzz has trouble believing he's just a simple toy and nothing more, as he thinks he's actually BUZZ LIGHTYEAR! It also seems this couldn't have come at a worse time for the toys, as Andy and his mother are moving away, which is causing all sorts of chaos as Woody tries to get everything organized so nobody is left behind, and that's exactly what happens with rivals Woody and Buzz, who are misplaced and must find their beloved Andy before they move. Not only that, they must also battle Sid, the serial killer in-training kid that lives next door and tortures toys. As directed by John Lasseter and his army of screenwriters including himself, Andrew Stanton (who would co-direct Pixar's future hit ""Finding Nemo"" in 2003) and Joel Cohen, ""Toy Story"" is true imaginative fantasy realized in superb animation. It more than brings the kid in you to the surface, it makes you want to be a kid again, as many toys have cameos including Army Men (including the Sergeant who's voiced by R. Lee Ermey) and Mr. Potato Head (voiced by Don Rickles). I love ""Toy Story,"" and I think anyone who views it thoughtfully will love it too.10/10","

"TOY STORY","ofpsmith","15 January 2015","The first feature length Pixar film and the first feature film to be made entirely in computer animated imagery Toy Story was a milestone in film history. But apart from it's massive impact, Toy Story is still a really great film. The toys in the bedroom of Andy Davis (John Morris) are alive (when Andy doesn't look) and seem to have their own community set up. The most popular toy being Andy's favorite toy, a toy cowboy named Woody (Tom Hanks). But that might change this birthday when Andy get's a new toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) a toy spaceman who still thinks that he's a real spaceman. To add on to that Woody takes an immediate disliking to Buzz because Andy seems to play with him more now and all the other toys go the same route. Well Woody and Buzz inadvertently end up in the house of Sid Phillips (Erik Von Detten) the destructive next door neighbor who is pretty much the type of person that would put a turtle on it's shell for fun. So Woody and Buzz have to overcome their differences and get back to Andy's house before he moves. This film's story is great and intriguing. The comedy here is also great. The dialog between Woody and Buzz is very funny. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. It's the birthplace of Pixar who over the years have proved themselves worthy of the praise given by adults and children alike.","

"TOY STORY","slokes","10 May 2004","Just in case you were also wondering what happened to all the toys that went missing when you were a kid, the answer is clear: They escaped.""Toy Story"" is the kind of children's movie adults can enjoy just as much, because it very cleverly mines deep deposits of nostalgia from the memory banks. That may be the reason the 1990s bedroom of young Andy is populated by playthings of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. If Andy was a real boy of his time, there would be a computer and a TV/Nintendo, and not much else.The voicings of the various toys add to the enjoyability. Tom Hanks was the biggest star of the moment when ""Toy Story"" came out, and he works with that likeability by creating a stable center as Woody the cowboy doll. Don Rickles has the screen role of his career (not that ""Kelly's Heroes"" was Oscar material) as a prickly Mr. Potato Head, while Jim Varney and R. Lee Ermey are standouts in the supporting cast.Tim Allen gives the movie's best performance, as a newfangled toy that takes Woody's place in Andy's heart but can't bring himself to accept that he's just a plastic plaything. It's the role of the story that gives him the best lines (""I don't believe that man has ever been to medical school""), but Allen delivers them with real panache. He more than holds his own, and you kind of see where he took off with that note-perfect William Shatner parody he perfected on screen in the underrated ""Galaxy Quest.""While this movie's use of computer animation makes it a milestone, it neither represents the most innovative use of the technology or the cleverest Pixar-ated treatment of a story. ""A Bug's Life"" seems a more worthy apex; that story was funnier, worked better on its own merits, and used the animation to better effect. But given how novel all of this was in 1995, ""Toy Story"" could have been a lot less thought-through than it was, and still made gobs of money. The fact it is instead invested with real heart, and can be watched and enjoyed today just as easily as when it debuted nearly 10 years ago, is a tribute to the people behind it.I like Randy Newman's music, just not here, and while the animation textures are surprisingly lifelike, there are places, especially with Scud the dog but also with the baby's drool, where it falls short. The story itself gets kind of rote with repeat viewings, though the transition to Sid's bedroom and its sad mutilated toys is a genius moment. So too are the vending machine aliens, who gape in rapt wonder at the judgment of ""the claw."" If it reached for pathos a little less often, ""Toy Story"" would be an undeniable classic.As it is, it is very, very good, the kind of film that's only good for children, even (especially?) the inner ones.","

What Pixar does is not just absorb the younger demographic and keep the older ones mildly entertained. It completely absorbs everyone watching no matter the age or the level of maturity, films of Pixar, starting from Toy Story, have kept a certain magical touch around it with an unexpected amount of depth. Everyone as a child imagines their toys will come alive and go on their own adventures. One of the great things Pixar does is that it does not attract audiences with its overloaded superstar casts but rather with its material. The only superstar here is Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is the next most aforementioned voice over. Unlike what most people think their is an actually a method to casting for animated films as there is to a live-action one. As a result of this Pixar stays faithful to its material and creates a great genuine and warm feeling around the film and its characters.","

"TOY STORY","TheLittleSongbird","16 June 2009","Toy Story is just a wonderful film, that I recommend to anyone who loves animation. I will also say that it is definitely the best Pixar movie to date, all of which are extremely good, even the weaker efforts Cars and the Incredibles are well worth watching. I loved the voice talents, the talented Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody, and Tim Allen likewise as Buzz. Both characters are hugely engaging thanks to their frequent conflicts, and are well supported by excellent supporting characters like Potato Head, Rex, Ham and Little Bo Beep, voiced by the likes of Don Rickles, Jim Varney, John Ratzenberger and Annie Potts. Not to mention the hilarious toy aliens, and the creepy kid Sid. The voice talents aren't the only things worth mentioning, the film has a remarkable story and a truly irreverent script (""I'm from Mattel, actually I'm from a smaller company that was purchased by Mattel in a leveraged buyout""). But the best aspect of the movie is the phenomenal animation, which was colourful and sophisticated with brilliant character movement. Honestly, I loved this movie, and I also thought the sequel is one of the few sequels of recent times, that actually manages to surpass its predecessor. All in all, a wonderful film, that is a must-see for the whole family. 10/10 Bethany Cox.","

The animation is still very expressive at capturing character, tone and making a believable world unto itself. Pixar would go on to create more polished films but this one has all the hallmarks of the company. The story is enjoyable for children and if parents squint they can see a metaphor in employment turnover. (Not to mention the cultural transition from westerns to sci-fi, or the meta irony of 2d cell animation being supplanted by CGI). The film is equal parts charming, funny and exciting. It even tugs at the heartstrings not matter how cynical you are. It is far from Pixar's best but it holds its own in the pantheon of animated films.","

"TOY STORY","OllieSuave-007","27 January 2014","Disney and Pixar studios team up and brought us an imaginative adventure story about a little boy named Andy who loves playing with his toys, with his best friend being a cowboy doll named Woody. However, when Andy and not body else is looking, the toys come to life. Woody is the leader of the toys in Andy's room, which include a Mr. Potato Head, Slinky the Dog, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Pig and Bo-Peep the girl doll. However, when Andy's get new toy space ranger Buzz Lightyear for his birthday, Buzz takes the place of Woody of being leader of the toys and Andy's new best friend. Brewing with jealously, Woody attempts to get rid of Buzz, but both ended up lost outside of Andy's house. As a result, they must find their way back to Andy's house before they move - first trying to get through Andy's weird neighbor and toy torturer Sid.This is filmed in brilliant and colorful computer animation - very detailed and realistic. The story is full of surprises and adventure, from Woody and Buzz getting lost in a pizza shop to them trying to break loose out of Sid's house to get back to Andy's. The movie is also filled with comedy; you will have to watch the movie to appreciate and understand the humor only live toys could make. And, there are toe-tapping songs you would learn to love including Randy Newman's opening song ""You've Got a Friend in Me."" While this movie's plot is full of non-stop fun and adventure, making every moment exciting and entertaining, the film also concentrates on friendship and teamwork and overcoming all odds. While I mostly enjoyed this movie, I wished that Woody was not made out to be hated on so much by the other toys after Woody's jealous behavior towards Buzz. I thought this takes away at Woody's hero status too much especially for his first movie.But overall, this is one of Disney's best work, which will make you suspend your disbelief and expand your imagination.

"TOY STORY","haydenluz","5 January 2021","Toy Story was directed & written by John Lasseter, being his, and Pixar's first major production. Toy Story was originated by John Lasseter himself, Joe Ranft, who wrote The Lion King & Beauty and the Beast, and the start of the iconic Pete Docter & Andrew Stanton as well.Toy Story broke so many barriers, creating the first full-length motion picture about toys, when we're not around, while giving them humanized traits, and problems, (I knew I wasn't the only one who used to think about my toys when I wasn't around, as a kid). It's almost impossible not to praise this film, being one of a few films 100% critically acclaimed on Rotten Tomatoes. Toy Story was an inventive family-film, created twenty-five years ago, and other then some mediocre animations, the film still holds up tremendously til this day! It is beautifully paced, while having high risks at all times.Before I jump into these amazing characters, I want to give credit to Janet Hirshen, Mike Fenton, Jane Jenkins & Ruth Lambert, for casting the absolute best voice over cast, someone could've ever put together. Sheriff Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, was the clear cut leader of the toys. Woody is the smartest of the group, stealing every scene he's in, with tremendous character development. Buzz Lightyear, voiced by Tim Allen, was a super enjoyable character, adding this toy personality, compared to everyone else's humanized personalities. Buzz complimented Woody very well throughout the whole film, creating a decent share of the risks. Rex, voiced by Wallace Shawn, was almost indefinitely the best character in the film. He is by far the funniest of the group, adding an unexpected twist to his personality. Mr. Potato Head, voiced by Don Rickles, acted as the dad character, with such a negative attitude, that clashed brilliantly with everyone. Hamm, voiced by John Ratzenberger, was one of the smartest of the pack, being very blunt, and right to the point. Slinky Dog, voiced by Jim Varney, was Woody's right hand man, being the most matured toy of the group. Our antagonist in Sid, is just as diabolical as the Joker, Thanos, & Scar. He is so dark and creepy, and poses a huge traumatic threat to any toy in the area, or in his possession.The screenplay by Andrew Stanton, Joe Ranft, Bud Luckey, Pete Docter, Joss Whedon, Joel Cohen & Alec Sokolow, was so pleasing for the kids and the adults, sneaking in their fair share of adult jokes. It captured so many heartfelt moments, ultimately hitting home when the film concludes.Toy Story was the first beautiful full length CG animated film! For 1995, these animations were essentially flawless! The production designers in Patsy Bouge & Karen Robert Jackson, created these brilliant sets & set pieces, with amazing sizeable shots, to give great depth, and life to everything.The score & music by Randy Newman worked phenomenally with the story. Not only was You Got a Friend in Me, a smash hit, but Strange Things Are Happening To Me, as well.Overall, even though this film had very minuscule nitpicks, with the editing, and some circumstances, it was still almost flawless! This is my second favorite film by Pixar, and one of my favorites of all time.","

"TOY STORY","tedg","16 November 2008","I see that my previous comment on this film was deleted.This is the thing that started it all: Pixar. Somewhat photorealistic modeling. Deep, deep attention to story dynamics. An animated feature not so polished since ""Snow White."" Something worthy. Something that led to the reinvention of Disney.Its an iconic turning point, like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""2001,"" ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" Greenaway's ""Tempest."" (and others) Many things after change. So it should be seen on its historical basis alone. Here already you can see that Pixar decides to combine goals. They want the movie to be just as good as the best non- animated movie. There is the well-documented attention to refining and refining the story dynamics so that the narrative spine simply works. That took years. What I mean by combined goals is that they also realized that they were presenting something relatively new in their three D modeling capability. So they wanted to have that new cinematic vocabulary enhance the narrative dynamics and vice versa. It is subtle here, not fully developed until ""Nemo."" But its plain to see when pointed out: the camera simply moves in ways that a real one does not. There are a broader set of intimate and distanced observer perspectives. These are not overused, lest you notice them, but you can see that out tolerance and viewing skill has slowly evolved from this to the later Pixar projects. (At this writing, that is ""Wall-E."") The business about family and desired roles are not ""the point"" as some would say, but strategies to explore this deeper narrative power.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","

It continues to be one of the epic children's movies.Behind several of the voices are well-known actor, such as Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles. That said, personally I have no affection for real-life, callous trophy hunters like R. Lee Ermey, which is playing the role of the sergeant.","

"TOY STORY","Mrbigham13","19 October 2021","I don't throw around the term masterpiece often so listen up! Ever since I was a child there have been few films that stay with me if any the way that Toy Story does. It's dips into the deepest parts of children's imaginations unlike any animated movie can. Toys that are alive? How cool is that!? Maybe I'm biased because I grew up with it but even today watching again in 2021 I'm still deeply satisfied. The characters, animation, story, and voice work is the finest you'll ever see. The entire franchise is phenomenal but of course nothing can top the original. If you haven't seen this by now you're doing a criminal disservice to yourself and possibly your children. This is the kind of movie that will live on to Infinity and Beyond!","

"TOY STORY","studioAT","13 June 2010","This film will continue to delight children for many years to come and will truly last the test of time because of it's simple story and bright and interesting characters. This was probably one of the first family films that adults could really enjoy as well and it is a testament to Disney and Pixar that other companies have tried to do this in their own films.The voice cast is fantastic and it is great that they all returned for the 1999 sequel as well as the soon to be released third film.Overall this was one of the main films of my childhood and I still enjoy it very much today. No matter how many films Dreamworks milk the Shrek franchise for it will never have the heart or the humour of Toy Story.","

"TOY STORY","hitchcockthelegend","14 July 2012","Toy Story is directed by John Lasseter who also co-writes the story with a whole host of other people! It features the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Annie Potts, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger and Laurie Metcalfe. Music is by Randy Newman.The first feature-length film animated entirely by computer, there's not a lot that can be said now that hasn't been said before about Toy Story, both as a film of heart and substance, and as regards its importance in the world of animation. Two further sequels would follow, both enormously successful and both equally as enjoyable. But it began here in 95, where Woody, Buzz and the gang operated on a level that beguiled the children whilst simultaneously bringing knowing laughs to the accompanying adults. Pixar paint a vivid colourful world, bringing us down to the toys level and etching in emotive threads about jealousies, friendships, neuroses' and the relationship between a child and his toys, while youthful splendour bathes the film constantly. Even though the plot is simple in terms of ambition, the characterisations are substantial and the film never panders to political correctness. The voice work of the actors is terrific, especially Hanks and Allen as Woody and Buzz respectively, their vocal comedy ticks wonderfully bring life to the animated figures, while Newman adds his optimistic tunes into the mix.Never maudlin or cheesy with its messages and sombre moments (something some other Disney films can't lay claim too), Toy Story's only crime is being too short at an hour and fifteen minutes (both subsequent sequels would rectify this issue). But it's a small complaint, probably (in my case) born out by greed for a longer adventure involving these marvellous creations. This was the start of a beautiful friendship for many, up there on the screen, and here in our own lives, thank you Pixar, you knocked it out of the park with this one, a film for all that keeps on giving delights with each subsequent revisit. 9.5/10","

"TOY STORY","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","9 July 2023","This is about getting older and losing status dealing with a new generation that wants to do things completely differently, through the metaphor of favorite toys, representing how the Western was overtaken by the sci-fi movie.I like that there are jokes for both the little ones and the adults. Puns and other verbal comedy. When it means to be tense and/or exciting, it legitimately does succeed. I really appreciate that the female characters are depicted as having emotional intelligence and compassion. All the toys have different personalities, some in contrast to the one one would guess - the T-Rex has anxiety, and can't yet roar in a scary way. Of course a lot of one-digit-agers love the idea of their toys being alive. I personally am grateful for this movie leading to the Army Men game series, since I greatly enjoyed the first two and some of the spin-offs.I've never been a fan of the fact that Sid is supposed to be the bad guy when he's just really creative. He doesn't know that the toys are alive, that he's torturing living things. Also based on the fact that he wears a black shirt with skull logo on it, he is either the Punisher as a teen, or a fan of the character, either way, awesome. His monsters are by far the coolest thing about the movie. I respect any kid's movie that is willing to admit that they can handle at least some horror. He's even nice enough to fix his sister's doll! I do appreciate the message of acceptance of those who are different that it does ultimately lead to. I agree with the interpretation that this film is about slavery, and I appreciate that the sequels help correct the issues that it brings up for this one - not sure anyone is gonna watch just one of these today.I've seen a number of people criticize the Randy Newman score, how it's literally spelling out what we're supposed to take away from the songs in the lyrics, so this is of course the part of the review where I would put it if I disagreed with that. As a matter of fact it would be this exact sentence that would express that.Overall, I definitely prefer Small Soldiers. I recommend this to everyone. 8/10.","

"TOY STORY","TheAvenger95","11 August 2014","This wonderful, heart-warming animated film has been considered a classic for many, many years.The story centers around Andy's toys who live happy, fun and peaceful lives, their only concern being birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could replace them. On one such birthday Andy's favourite toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself competing against Andy's new Buzz Lightyear action figure. When rivalries boil over, Woody tries to hide Buzz under Andy's bed, but accidentally pushes him out the window. The other toys exile Woody for this action, which leaves him no other choice, but to find Buzz and bring him back. However, with only two days before Andy's family moves, time is of the essence Not only is Toy Story a terrifically fun 80 minute adventure, but it also speaks about friendship and has underlying themes of what friendship really means and the importance of it. As a matter of fact, almost all aspects of the movie (such as the story, message, animation, voice cast, tone and humour) were extremely well executed. For truth, this really is a great movie for everyone – young and old – and would be an excellent choice for those looking for something light- hearted and family friendly.","

"TOY STORY","Pjtaylor-96-138044","19 June 2019","'Toy Story (1995)' is written incredibly well; everything just seems to fall, very satisfyingly, into place. What sets it apart from pretty much all others in its genre is just how flawed its protagonist is. He's a borderline anti-hero, self-destructively selfish for the movie's majority. This makes his arc all the more satisfying, though, even if it's about as classic as you can get. The friendship that forms between the two central characters feels palpable and genuinely fulfilling because it's nuanced and consistently strained. It really is remarkable that a film about talking toys has some of the most satisfying character arcs and central relationships of all time. Of course, the piece is also very funny. It fully uses its central conceit to deliver some truly inventive laughs. It doesn't feel as though it's pandering to children, either; in fact, it feels rather mature, all things considered. It's a fantastic time that will resonate with everyone who watches. It really is a classic, one to be considered amongst the greats - animated or otherwise. 10/10","

"TOY STORY","StevePulaski","22 April 2011","Toy Story was the first entirely computer animated film in its time of release in 1995, and it puts Pixar on the map for a generation of amazingly crafted films to be made. The attention to detail is exquisite in this picture as reflections, flexibilities, and movement are all captured in such a stunning format it's almost too much to comprehend. Everything moves so fluently, is crafted with such a broad mind it's still astonishing to this date.CGI animation is made with wondrous creativity and the possibilities to show off it's style are virtually unlimited. Though when companies in 2011 make kids movies like these they forget about the storyline and just make the film loud and colorful to attract the youth's attention. Not Pixar. Pixar is so much smarter. They understand good animation and a great storyline with characters. Show me a Pixar movie that isn't at least above average and I'll show you a car that can you can drive with no wheels.But CGI animation has it's downsides. Being released in 1995, Toy Story was the first computer animated film. Meaning other companies were racing their technology where everyone wanted to take advantage of the CGI craze. The main company in this heated competition was DreamWorks Animation Studios. Their first feature film was Antz, notable for being almost a direct knockoff of Pixar's A Bug's Life which came out the same year (1998). Following Antz came others like Chicken Run and The Road to El Dorado. Still none of which lived up to Toy Story's caliber.DreamWorks scored big when releasing Shrek in 2001. It definitely put them on the map of animation companies, and it's surely remembered more than Chicken Run. But still, while Shrek had a more rapid fire sequel release schedule than Toy Story, none of which had the same heart, message, or love any of these films had.One last downside is that CGI, no matter which way you look at it, killed hand drawn animation. Generations of kids now likely will never get to experience the classic animation like they should. If they do they will most likely hate it after being exposed to all the glossy and more stylish animation that is among us today. But shows like Beavis and Butthead and The Simpsons are just as good.Enough with the animation history, lets talk about the film. I doubt anyone will disagree with me, that this is one of the greatest animated films of all time. It combines clever antics with loving characters you become attached to. It's funny to think toys have a mind of their own. Plus all the trouble they would experience if they were alive.Andy (Morris) is a typical child. He has a number of toys of different varieties and enjoys making up little adventures the figures can go on. All ranging from a Mr. Potato Head, a cowboy doll, a toy piggy bank, and others. Woody (Hanks), a cowboy doll, who now feels threatened when a flashy, gadget filled toy named Buzz Lightyear (Allen) is given to Andy for his birthday. Buzz impresses the entire gang of toys much to the dismay and fear of Woody that he will become another forgotten toy.Simple premise. Giant execution. It's everything and more. In the nineties, this animation was simply groundbreaking. Because this was the first film made by Pixar, the standard hadn't been set yet. But it was clear after Toy Story that animation would be forever changed for more than one reason.Starring: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Annie Potts, John Morris, Laurie Metcalf, and Erik von Detten. Directed by: John Lasseter.","

"TOY STORY","ElMaruecan82","11 January 2012","Almost 20 years have passed since the nineties  Now, we are so familiar with the cell- phones, Facebook and the Internet that we're totally amnesic regarding these years where we had none, and we all scratch our heads wondering how communication was even possible back then. Not too surprisingly, the same reasoning can be applied for animation: we're so used to CGI and 3D animated films that we forgot how groundbreaking Walt Disney's ""Toy Story"" was in 1995, and that we witnessed an event as historical as the release of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". It's not surprising, by the way, that the two films are the only animated features included in the American Film Institute's Top 100 List.The comparison with ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" doesn't only rely on the technical achievement and the critical recognition, but also on what drove these two crucial aspects: an endearing and universally appealing story. ""Snow White"" exploited all the comical possibilities of the dwarfs, in order to use physically distinct characters with different personalities attributed to each of them, while the Queen and Snow White could be modeled in more realistic designs; the setting also allowed the drawers to extend their talents and give it the touch of magic and escapism the audiences needed back then. ""Toy Story"" does the exact same thing, it chooses the best setting that can justify a clever and playful use of three-dimensionality, by creating a sort of underworld made of different forms and colors, a world where toys come to life when the owner is absent. This choice is a strike of genius because it provides an escapist value in our own environment, Disney made enough movies set in forests, mountains, jungles, so for its first 3D film, we have the first in-door Disney film, which gives an irresistible feeling of intimacy.This simplicity is the perfect counterpart to the complexity of special effects and the creativity of the screenplay because it also succeeds to add a little touch of nostalgia and hit a sensitive chord by waking the inner child inside of us. In 1995, we're in the midst of Disney Renaissance and its streak of successful films was so full of adventures and romance, thrills and laughs that ""Toy Story"" almost resonates as a comeback to the roots of the Walt Disney Company, childhood. Haven't we all played with toys when we were kids, whether they were dolls, Smurfs figurines, cars, monsters, haven't we all used our hands, totally invisible for our little eyes, and talked instead of characters, like magical puppeteers, imagining them sliding from a ravine that was our bathtub, or escalating a mountain, the bed-pillow. Toys were always alive for us, because our games were precisely what brought them to life, and in ""Toy Story"", we always have the feeling that the creators are less 'making a film' than playing with toys like we used to do, engaging a tacit complicity with the kids in the audience, and the inner kids within the adults from the audience.""Toy Story"" assumes that toys are alive, and the script is so well written that we're immediately convinced. There's no way Woody, the cowboy doll with Tom Hanks' voice couldn't be alive, that the cocky Buzz Lightyear is only a 3D talking image, that Mr. Potato Head isn't that grouchy figurine or that the Tyrannosaurus isn't that cute andcoward creature, all the toys that belong to little Andy incarnate Disney's magical power, bringing things to life, and we realize how we all had a Disney inside us when we were playing with our toys. And ""Toy Story"" couldn't have a more appropriate villain than a kid who destroyed toys, Sid: a character I despised so much because I was definitely not a Sid when I was younger. ""Toy Story"" is an odyssey in the world of toys after which we don't look at them the same way, calling them objects is almost insulting. Indeed, I've always felt guilty because as a teen, my mother told me to get rid of my toys, to give them to needier boys, and although I didn't play with them anymore, I remember how painful it was to say them goodbye, after ""Toy Story"", now I feel better with myself.And ""Toy Story"" doesn't just take its creativity and the cuteness of its characters for granted, there are the lines, the humor, but the story too, starting with the antagonism between the two 'lead' toys. Woody is jealous because Buzz, Andy's new birthday gift, became his best friend, in other words, his favorite toy, while Buzz doesn't know he's only a toy and lives in total denial about his true nature, which adds an unexpected bit of poignancy to characters that are not just three-dimensional on a geometrical level. The film has its share of action, mostly with the Buzz and Woody's duo trying to get back to Andy's house before the family moves in, but the emotional core of the film is their friendship. And progressively, their journey will allow them to understand the value of a toy, illustrated by Newman's Oscar-nominated song ""You've Got a Friend in Me""; there would still be room for Woody in Andy's heart and there's an inner nobility in toys in the way they bring happiness during our most treasured memories.'Toy Story"" is a beautiful friendship story between two lovable toys, (have you noticed that Buzz and Woody makes buddy if you associate them), whose friendship culminate at the moment where both 'fall with style' in Andy's box. And I guess this is why we hardly remember how groundbreaking ""Toy Story"" was, maybe we just forgot about the special effects and the whole 3D thing, and simply remember the beauty of the story.","

The story of this film is deeply moving, not only to focus on strong themes like loyalty and friendship but, mainly, because it mess with our fondest memories by involving toys that we all played when we were kids. Its not a coincidence that we see, in this film, toys of our parents and grandparents living with action figures and games of our time. This film tries to touch everyone, from the small audience to the adults who take them to the movies.

In a mere 80 minutes, the film introduces us to a group of toys devoted to their beloved Andy and gets us to care about that relationship, to infinity and beyond.

As a parent, you dread seeing the same animated movies over and over again (kids never get bored seeing the same movie many times), but this one is different. I've lost track how many times I've seen it and it's just as enjoyable as the first time I saw it.

"TOY STORY","Jeremy_Urquhart","11 March 2022","I think I owe Toy Story an apology.Even though I watched it countless times as a kid, and enjoyed it as a (very young) adult when I revisited it in 2013, I think I've taken it for granted a bit.Because yes, it doesn't quite have the same emotional impact as 2 or 3 for me, and the animation is undoubtedly tougher... but it's still such a fantastically well made movie, and it's a testament to the trilogy as a whole that it started so well and only got better (as for Toy Story 4? I still like it, but it doesn't feel as essential).This is just so well written, packed full of jokes, filled with great characters, and it's such a unique and creative premise. Also, the character arcs and personal journeys that both Woody and Buzz go through simultaneously are fantastic, and both are examples of almost perfect character development. It puts the writing in most non-kids movies to shame.And as for the limited, sometimes dated animation? A lot of the time it still looks alright to be honest. They made it work well for the most part, by choosing to animate toys. It didn't matter if what they animated looked a little plastic or mechanical- that can just be how toys that come to life would function. It works.Music's also really good throughout, as is almost all the voice acting. It's a fantastic movie, and I'm excited to see if I enjoy the later entries in the series even more on a rewatch, too.","

Therefore this film can not achieve the rating good (8 out of 10) by me, for a good film (in my opinion) is good on more than just one or two levels and it has to cover the entire film (preferably exceeding in more than one genre).

"TOY STORY","zkonedog","11 March 2017","Until the Disney-Pixar collaboration that produced this wonderful film, movies were pretty much lopped into two basic categories: child & adult. Children would be lost, bored, terrified, or scarred by the adult fare, while adults would be lost, bored, and uncomfortable at the kiddie flicks. Fortunately, ""Toy Story"" changed everything.For a basic plot summary, this all-CGI film focuses on the childhood toys of young Andy. At first, Andy is in his ""cowboy stage"", and so western doll Woody (Tom Hanks) is his prized possession. However, once Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) arrives via an extra-special birthday present, things begin to change inside the toybox, as the two begin a battle for supremacy over young Andy.There are two main areas in which this movie succeeds so brilliantly: First, it is incredible eye- candy for children. Running the gamut from every type of toy and crazy situation imaginable, this film enraptures the kiddies and will have them watching over and over.Second, it works because you will be watching it over and over with them! As you marvel at the CGI effects, you will also be laughing at the hilarious jokes that, while going right over your kid's head, will make you burst into laughter. This is mainly accomplished by the cast of ""supporting"" characters such as the wise-cracking Hamm (John Ratzenberger), the cowardly dinosaur Rex (Wallace Shawn), the loyal dog Slink (Jim Varney), and the ever-sardonic Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles). Their jokes and humorous situations will make it feel as if you aren't watching a kids movie at all.Also, though the technology has come a long way even since this film's 1995 release date, it is still no less of a filmmaking marvel. For perhaps the first time in cinema history, computer- animation actually made you feel as if you were watching a ""real"" film, not just a cheap special- effects bonanza.Overall, ""Toy Story"" is one of the most influential films ever produced for its ability to blur the lines between children and adult cinema. For the first time, parents were truly able to enjoy a movie with their children.","

"TOY STORY","Groverdox","24 February 2023","People who aren't old enough to remember the '90s don't realise how much of a cultural touchstone certain films were. Everybody saw ""Jurassic Park"" at the movies more than once. Ditto ""The Lion King"". People could quote ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" without even having seen either movie because of the brand they left on pop culture.In some ways ""Toy Story"" might be the most revolutionary flick of the '90s. It is the first full-length CGI film. It marked the ascendancy of 3D-animation over 2D in film in the same way that ""The Jazz Singer"" showed the world that silent films would soon be replaced by talkies.Here's the point that matters the most for us, though: ""The Jazz Singer"" is only really remembered for its technical achievement in sound, if at all. If it weren't the first talking picture, it'd be forgotten about. ""Toy Story"", on the other hand, is remembered, simply, because it is brilliant.The movie is nothing but pure creativity and visual invention for its whole length. You can feel the influence of the old (even at the time) Warner Brothers cartoons with constant sight gags, and the quirky, lovable individuality of each character.The filmmakers also use feature film length to craft some incredibly beautiful, heartwarming moments into the story. The characters are not perfect, and at times even appear unlikeable. But the movie makes them so ironically human that when they redeem themselves you only love them more.The movie also evinces genuine heart-ache and surprising poignancy. The scene where Woody and Buzz realise that the deformed toys in the villain's room are actually not to be feared, that they're good hearted creatures just like the two of them despite what they've been through and what they look like: I thought that was beautiful in '95 age ten, and I thought it was beautiful now. And the villain, Sid's, long-suffering younger sister, just a sweet girl who has to live with her older brother's cruelty? I wanted to hug her, polygons be damned.Here's something else that's amazing about ""Toy Story"": I thought that the world's first CGI animated full-length movie, which is now almost thirty years old (!), would look a little dated, like the earliest cartoons do. It doesn't look dated at all. I don't know how they pulled that off.For all ""Toy Story""'s stunning technical achievements, for its somehow also reaching new heights in cartoon storytelling, for it accessing feelings in us we never thought it would bring out, I haven't mentioned what might have been the biggest revelation ""Toy Story"", and Pixar, brought us in the '90s. That is, the fact that a movie for kids has no reason to not be just as beloved by adults as any child. Gone were the days when adults suffered through kids' movies waiting for them to end. Pixar realised that the themes and lessons in their movies were just as valuable to the older generation as to the young. What children needed to be encouraged to remember, adults needed to be reminded. And in being reminded, ""Toy Story"", and all the other brilliant Pixar works that followed it, reminded us that childhood is never really gone, the child we were is still with us, needing to be loved and celebrated.Is ""Toy Story"" the best movie of the '90s? It's certainly way up there.","

"TOY STORY","Vartiainen","20 February 2018","In many ways Toy Story is just as big of a film as Snow White, or My Neighbor Totoro. It is the first of its kind, really. The very first feature-length computer-animated film and the founding stone of Pixar Studios. And quite like Snow White, it is still a marvelous film. With certain, minor caveats.First the praise. The story is still incredible. It has to be for the film to have withstood the test of time so well. It is about toys coming to life when humans are away at least partly because toys were much easier to animate than real humans (the humans in this film look scary, by the way), but great storytelling is often inspired by limitations. And that certainly applies here. Through simple childhood toys we explore the concepts of growing up, learning new things, meeting new people, dealing with failed expectations, fear of loss, abandonment and betrayal, letting go of things, and most importantly, about friendship and family. And it's all told through a fetching, relatable and kid-friendly narrative.The characters are also a lot of fun, though as a kid I never realized what a jerk Woody (Tom Hanks) really is. Sure, that's his point, but I always though that the cowboy had something of a point. Perhaps kids see these things differently. And nevertheless, the idea that Woody was in the wrong was clear even back then.Unfortunately what hasn't aged so well is the animation. The humans look terrible, yes, but that was clear even in 1995. But the toys were phenomenal back then. Mindblowing, quite frankly. Less so today. The movement is still really smooth and the designs are interesting, but it all looks so plasticky. The movie works around that admirably - most of the characters are made of plastic, after all - but it still leaves the movie looking flat and lifeless even when it's not supposed to look like it. I've heard it said that early hand-drawn animation looks charmingly simple, whereas early computer-animation simply looks cheap. And there's some truth to that, I'm afraid to tell.Still, Toy Story is a classic. Not my favourite Pixar film by far, but it did start something quite wonderful.","

"TOY STORY","JohnnyJohnHildegaard","18 May 1999","Toy is one of the most excellent computer-animated movies of all time.  It feels different to see through the eyes of a toy and become very immersed in the detail and action. This is an excellent movie to buy for yourself (although a Bug's Life is more hilarious)...","

"TOY STORY","jzappa","22 October 2008","Toy Story fashions an existence as its characters know it out of a couple of young kids' bedrooms, a gas station, and an expanse of suburban freeway. It also enters an arcade- restaurant that recaptures that consumerist wonder of being a kid surrounded by video games and pizza. Its heroes are toys, which come to life when nobody is watching. Its conflict is between an old-fashioned cowboy doll who has always been an 8-year-old boy's favorite toy, the effective leader of the kid's toys as a collective community, and the new action figure who is starting to take his place. The villain is the grungy kid next door who takes toys apart and puts them back together again in morbid mishmashes, that is when he's not blowing them with fireworks. And the result is an emotional roller-coaster of a movie experience that does not diminish with age.For kids, a movie like this works immaculately because it tells a fun story that presumably exists already somewhere in their minds when they are playing with their own toys. They can relate very deeply to these toy characters because of the role toys play in their lives. Older viewers can be even more immersed, because you find that after all these years, you still have such emotion invested in these toys. When Woody peeks from the toy chest at his boy, Andy, sleeping with Buzz Lightyear in his arms, I am truly touched. If you saw this as a kid and haven't seen it since, feeling you have outgrown it, you must revisit it, for you will discover quite the contrary.In a way, it could have been even more interesting and rewarding to have been your parents' age in 1995 when the film emerged as the first film animated entirely by computer. To us as kids, visual nuance was the last thing on our minds. The most rudimentary elements of the cinematic experience were all that mattered to us, and we were transported. Now, we are completely accustomed to Pixar's series of family films that transcend what one normally perceives as the cornball throwaway inanity of so many of them.John Lasseter opens the film in the---let's face it---spoiled 8-year-old's bedroom, where the toys come to life when their owner is gone. Each of the toy characters is rich and detailed. The playroom cunningly figures in well-known toys from real life, which may be product placement, but who cares when it functions as a great way for us to relate that much more with these characters by means of direct familiarity.","

"TOY STORY","Special-K88","26 April 2002","Clever, heartwarming story centers around a group of living toys and their perspectives on the world they inhabit, one in which attention from their owner is the essence of their very existence. An old-fashioned cowboy doll and longtime favorite of his child owner is threatened by the arrival of a sophisticated, high-tech space ranger. Despite their differences, they eventually realize that they need each other in order to overcome a dangerous predicament. On the surface it's the first film ever done completely with computer animation, but at its heart is a compelling story of friendship, love, and acceptance. Terrific songs, remarkable animation, and a perfect cast of voices make this an engaging experience for all ages. A family film and so much more. ***½","

"TOY STORY","drqshadow-reviews","24 July 2011","The visuals don't look as polished as you may have come to expect, so it's a testament to the quality of writing that this movie is still as good today as it was sixteen years ago. I can't undersell the ingenuity of the filmmaking either, as Pixar does more with limited technology and a thin rule book than most CGI artists can manage today. Careful, artistic shot selection and playful direction really do a lot to compensate for the occasional bad render, and a world-class cast of voice actors takes care of the rest. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen deserve every bit of recognition they get for their roles as Woody and Buzz; they really put the film on their shoulders and carry it right over the top, shifting something that would've probably been pretty good in other hands into a raging success story.","

"TOY STORY","MissSimonetta","2 March 2020","TOY STORY is a movie I tend to only revisit now and then, but man, is it truly a modern classic! Though the textures and human characters are quite dated by our standards, the story and film-making craft remain timeless. The comedy and suspense play off one another well, and rarely has a domestic setting like this ever felt so epic in scope. Like Disney's debut feature SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, Pixar's TOY STORY is imbued with a sense of playful discovery, innocence, and joy that lets it stand apart from the studio's later output. While they would go on to make more sophisticated films, TOY STORY's strength is in its simplicity and youthful spirit-- just a perfect movie in all the ways that matter.","

I won't talk about the story because everyone knows it by now & knows the fantastic franchise it has become but way back in the wonderful 90's, well 1995 to be exact, this New Computer Animated movie came out & blew everyone's minds.I was obsessed with Toy Story at my young age & fell in love with the lovely characters, especially Woody & Buzz & i loved the story of friendship & buddy banter & the danger of the outside world & the beautiful animation was just amazing.Tom Hanks who puts his heart into the voice of Cowboy doll WOODY is fantastic & i liked Nice-guy Hanks from films such as Dragnet & The 'Burbs, both two of my Childhood faves & of course the great Tim Allen who also put his heart into super cool space figure BUZZ LIGHTYEAR & the two are iconic characters now & back then i was obsessed with them & all the other supporting Toy characters.Toy Story is a film i had on video & i grabbed it as soon as it was available to buy & oh my did i watch it over & over again, non-stop in my video player & i knew every single word & all the lovely songs. Toy Story really is a film that has a huge spot in my movie loving heart & is definitely one of my most watched movies of all time-along with Ghostbusters 2 & Dragnet. I'm now 37 & still love this film & always will & i love the franchise.I adore Tim Allen's voice because of his work as Buzz & same for Hanks with Woody.Truly a Masterpiece movie & one that had such a huge & deep impact on us 90's kids.To infinity & beyond....

The movie still holds up as the first 3D animated movie.Tom Hanks and Tim Allen as Woody and Buzz Lightyear is great casting, the 2 toys work well together and are funny to watch. The rest of the toys are voiced by great voice actors like Wallce Shawn as Rex or Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head.I especially like what the toys do when the humans are not around, and they can be worried about being replaced by a new toy. The movie is 1 hour 21 minutes so it is a quick watch, and you can have fun while watching it.There are lots of memorable scenes and quotable funny dialogue. If you have not seen Toy Story (1995) I suggest you check it out.","

"TOY STORY","TOMNEL","11 March 2011","PIXAR is a brand that is now synonymous with quality, and it's not hard to see why this is. They have consistently made wonderful animated pictures that are very funny and heartwarming, and all have memorable and soon to be iconic scenes. They never pander to children, nor do they rely on cheap gags or melodrama. This film is the epitome of what PIXAR is about. ""Toy Story"" is one of the greatest animated films, that in recent years has only been topped by a few other PIXAR films.In the world this film sets up, toys are all alive, though they don't let that known to people. They play their roles are toys and when the people are not in sight, they talk about their job of being played with, and their personal lives. It's Andy's birthday, and all the toys in his room are worried about this fate with new toys coming in. Woody the cowboy doll is the leader of the group and is Andy's favorite toy, but Andy just received a new space toy, Buzz Lightyear, and now Woody is playing second fiddle and he doesn't like that. After mistakenly knocking Buzz out the window, the toys turn on Woody and he and Buzz end up on an adventure trying to find Andy and make it back to his house before he and his family move.The characters are always walking a fine line here, and never once do they fall off into one side. Woody could be very unlikable. He's always complaining, shouting all the time and he does some pretty mean things. Woody may be occasionally ill intentioned, but he is never malicious, and instead of being a complete jerk, he is often fighting between what is right and wrong and picks the former. The characters can be mean, but they're well intentioned in the end, and it's what shows in them. This film is of course a technical achievement, boasting that it's the first feature length fully computer animated movie. The animation looks great still today, but in a film world dominated by special effects and computer animation, it's very difficult to impress, but what still stands out about this film's look is it's visual style. From strange mid 50s interior designs to the atmospheric and beautiful golden hour look of certain scenes, this movie has such unique sets and shadows and just the atmosphere overall is very involving. The exciting chase and action sequences are also remembered and still today look dazzling. But what makes those scenes, namely the whole moving van sequence at the end, is the emotion. You feel for these characters, and the ""Falling with style"" callback that could feel contrived and corny, comes off as heartwarming. All the great scenes in the film have a level of humanity underneath all the negativity and cynicism of Woody that makes this animated toy feel very human.Randy Newman can be a little samey in some of his musical work, but his songs and score work very well here. The songs give us insight into what the character is feeling, and raise the emotion. His score plays off really well, and is catchy and bouncy without being cheesy. You'll find yourself singing these songs and humming the music after watching this.Toy Story is animated masterpiece. Unlike many of Disney animation's masterpieces, like the wonderful ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""The Little Mermaid"", this plays as a film instead of a great animated movie. It's a timeless film that will surely entertain many generations to come. It's a true classic!My rating: **** out of ****. 81 mins. Rated G.","

"TOY STORY","Zac_La_Porte","14 September 2021","It simply isn't acceptable to label Toy Story as anything slighter than a wonderfully timely, sweet, hilarious and inventive animation. It's also just as excellent that instead of relying on dumb styles of comedy for children, this classic chooses to stick to childlike playfulness and a beautiful animation technique that'll have all ages giggling together. Seriously, you need to enjoy this flick with the company of all your friends and family.The young children mightn't notice it, but the good old computer-animation operation is simply gorgeous, memorable and adorable. Unlike most animations today, Toy Story really gives you the childhood vibes. Everyone should accept the opportunity to watch this as a little kid. The imaginative toy characters, including Buzz, Woody, Potato Head and Slinky, are utterly charming and are mainly why this adventure-comedy will remain creatively flawless.We need to finally approach at least the mention of the brilliant voice actors. The voice of Tom Hanks is absolutely hilarious and witty behind our lead toy. The other cute characters are also accompanied by amazing voices, and that beside the charming visuals and clever ideas makes pure movie magic!If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","

"TOY STORY","KUAlum26","23 November 2005","PIXAR animation was but an experimental animation company that had a track record of short film contributions to film festivals when Disney invested in and ultimately released their first project,Toy Story. I figured Disney probably had a good feeling about this one,but I'm not sure they anticipated the kind of groundbreaking swell of animation this would shepherd in.The concept is a fitfully simple and cute one: when kids are away,their toys take on personalities and lives of their own,plotting,planning,bickering,reacting,flirting,etc. In this particular den of toys, a Cowboy Woody doll(voiced by Tom Hanks) is the leader,flanked by a Slinky dog(Jim Varney),green toy soldiers(aptly casted R.Lee Ermey as their platoon leader),a Mr.Potato head(Don Rickles), a Piggy bank(John Ratzenberger,forever Cliff Claven from ""Cheers"") and a Bo Peep doll(Annie Potts). Into the mix is a new,electronic Buzz Lightyear action figure(Tim Allen,who probably does the best voice acting of the bunch here),who almost instantly wows the locals and stirs jealousy from Woody.With music from Randy Newmann--a personal fave of mine--this movie's colors,attention to detail and wry humor make it easily adaptable to kids and adults alike. CAn it really be ten years since this film broke new ground on animation? How time flies in the wake of stuff like ""Shrek"" and ""FInding Nemo""!","

"TOY STORY","bankofmarquis","16 December 2018","With Toy Story 4 coming out in theaters this summer, I thought I'd go back and check out a beloved classice - the original TOY STORY (1995) to see if this film holds up to my memory of it.It sure does.Directed by visionary Pixar founder John Lasseter, TOY STORY is the first computer generated full-length motion picture and tells the...story...of toys that come to life when the humans leave the room. It is a simple concept that is executed beautifully with wit, charm and heart that sustains to this day and (I would imagine) to infinity...and beyond.Besides the revolutionary CGI work (which mostly holds up), the heartwarming story and the crispness of the pacing of the film, the masterstroke here is the pitch perfect voice casting. Tom Hanks was the first - and only - choice for Woody, the Cowboy doll that has been the main toy for Andy. His confidence is shattered when Andy receives a Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday and he struggles to maintain control of the room - and Andy's heart. In lesser hands, this character could be be annoying and a bit of a jerk, but with Hanks' inherent charm, Woody is lovable, neurotic and vulnerable as he tries to get out of one jam after another.Tim Allen wasn't the first choice for the voice of Buzz Lightyear, but with his success in 1994's THE SANTA CLAUS he was called into service on this film - and the results couldn't be better. He blends machismo, bluster and a sincere earnestness that perfectly pairs and counterbalances Hanks' tics to form a movie duo that ranks right up there with the best in film history.It is the attention to detail that these filmmakers really excel at and the supporting cast of voice actors really brings it here. From Don Rickles to John Ratzenberger to Annie Potts to R. Lee Emery to Jim Varney to Laurie Metcalf, all bring charm and heart to their characters even when they are in conflict.Speaking of attention to detail, the CGI in this film works really, really well - even after 23 years of improvements. The filmmakers were blazing a trail and there is much to look at in the background, from the 2 ""Hidden Mickey's"" in Andy's room to the tribute to THE SHINING, the background and renderings are lush and are worth a viewing just to look at hidden gems (and Easter Eggs) in the background.But none of this would matter if the story wasn't any good and I give story writers Lasseter and future Pixar Director's Pete Docter and Andrew Stanton credit for keeping the story crisp, clear and simple and infusing heart and sincerity without getting cloying or annoying. Interestingly enough, in looking at the credits, Joss Whedon, Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow were all contributors to the screenplay as well. When I see that many writers on a screenplay, I worry about continuity and flow. But, make no mistake about it, this film has a strong vision driven by Lasseter and the results on the screen show that focus.If you haven't seen this film in awhile, give yourself a treat and check it out again, it holds up very, very well and will be well worth the 84 minutes it will take to watch it (the shortest of all PIXAR films).Letter Grade A+ - which means, of course...A rare 10 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","

"TOY STORY","Michael_Elliott","22 December 2010","Toy Story (1995) *** 1/2 (out of 4) A kid's toy room is split after his former favorite toy Woody (Tom Hanks) gets replaced with the newest sensation Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). The gunslinger Woody can't except the fact that he's no longer the kid's favorite so he and Buzz end up outside of the house and must try and find a way back. The Pixar form of animation has become the standard today so I'm sure many people watching these films forget how groundbreaking this movie was when it was first released. I was only fifteen at the time but giving it a second viewing after all these years just reminds me at why this thing became a hit. Not only is the animation beautiful and extremely life like but we also got a terrific screenplay that certainly brings these characters to life and really makes them something special. The idea of a film being centered on toys that come to life when no one is looking is something so simple yet so genius that you can't help but wonder why it took someone so long to do a film. The screenplay is without question one of the best ever written for an animation movie as all of the characters, from Woody and Buzz to Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney) are perfectly brought to life. The child-like nature of the story has so much energy that you can't help but smile at each journey that the toys find themselves on. The amount of imagination in the screenplay is what makes it so special because it really does seem like something a kid would come up with while playing alone in his room with the toys. Everyone can remember what it was like being a kid and playing with these toys and bringing them to life in our minds so to see that played out on the screen is certainly something special. The film has terrific laughs but also a nice message. The voice work is terrific with Hanks and Allen clearly leading the way but that Southern draw of Varney is special as well. TOY STORY was ground breaking when originally released and it comes as no shock that the film hasn't lost any of its impact. The screenplay with its great characters and story is guaranteed to be enjoyed for decades to come.","

"TOY STORY","bobsgrock","26 January 2008","Disney used to be good, wholesome family entertainment that was not only clean but fun. Now, most everything they put out is outdated postmodern trash that portrays all children as geniuses able to rule the world and all parents as evil minions trying to keep their children from having fun. Thank God for Pixar coming to existence. Starting with Toy Story in 1995, they made a great family film that appeals to adult humor as well as children. They haven't failed since. They can do no wrong it seems, and I pray it continues that way. Of all their great films, this is undoubtedly in my mind the best of them all. It is also arguably better than any animated film Disney ever did, including the classics of the 1940s and 50s. The premise is so clever and daring in that it could go wrong in so many ways. It never does, though, and in a mere 82 minutes, it covers more information than many other 2 hour films. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen have become iconic in their roles as Woody and Buzz. The animation and dialogue is so good it is as if they are really on screen arguing with one another. The supporting characters are also very good and funny. With animation, perhaps the most important aspect is the voice characters. Pixar has done a great job of not always going with a star to do the voices, but rather simply going with the one that fits the character best. Overall, Toy Story is superb film-making with a great script, wonderful voices and animation that still impresses despite all the technological improvements. Thank you, Pixar. I am truly grateful to you for saving animated films.","

Disney/Pixar computer-generated cartoon has witty writing and incredible visuals to spare, though some scenes are heavy with chatter and the climactic race to catch up to a moving van is stretching things, even for a kid's picture. Still, some of the lines (which fly by at top speed) are very sharp and funny, and the star-voices (particularly Tim Allen's as Buzz) are uncanny. **1/2 from ****","

Especially of note is the irrepressible Tom hanks as Woody, Andy's favourite toy (until now), and Tim Allen, hilariously deadpan as space ranger Buzz Lightyear, the new guy in town.The comedy stays fresh and lively throughout while there is always something happening to keep little eyes tuned.

"TOY STORY","Doylenf","19 December 2010","It's only now, fifteen years after its release, that I decided to give TOY STORY a look on my large flat screen TV. I've never been a fan of computer animation per se, but this charming story has heart and wit and enough entertainment value for both young and old. The toy characters are both appealing and very funny in ways that anyone can appreciate, thanks to a clever script.Woody the Cowboy and Buzz Lightyear compete for the affections of a small boy, Andy, whose playroom is loaded with toys that come alive whenever anyone leaves the bedroom. Out of this fresh idea, the plot bounces along with supreme confidence as it races forward putting all of them in constant danger from their ever changing environment, especially when they leave the confines of Andy's home.Technically, the film is a marvel--everything simulated through computer wizardry, all of it invented with taste for artistry evident in every frame of the film--the kind of artistry that the Walt Disney studio demonstrated during the heyday of their cartoon wizardry.The brilliant colors look even more amazing in the good print of the film that aired on cable tonight. Well worth watching for pure family entertainment, a rarity nowadays.","

Being older I realize it's not just entertainment but also a milestone in film making as a whole. This's the first movie to be animated entirely in CGI. The casts is amazing and really bring the characters to life. Tom Hanks as Woody has a blend between seriousness and hysterical which balances out with Tim Allen as the newcomer Buzz in his portrayal of a delusional hotshot. The supporting cast is amazing too. I really like Don Rickles as the snarky Mr. Potato Head, Wallace Shawn as the neurotic Rex and John Ratzenburg as the laid-back piggy bank, Ham.The jokes are hilarious. One joke that passed me as a kid was when Woody wanted to call him something but couldn't due to there being a kids toy nearby. Another is when Bo suggestively thanks Woody for saving her sheep during a play session with Andy. That's all i'm going to say. Toy Story's one of the best family movies ever made. It has something for both kids and adults. Hop on in and check it out.","

I look forward to its appearing every year on television, as a much anticipated ""event.""It certainly is groundbreaking, what with imagery that must've taken a computer system dwarfing the pentagon's to do.But I love how well-thought-out this movie is. The plot works from beginning to end. The performances are terrific--Tom Hanks and Tim Allen don't just blather their lines onto the soundtrack, leaving it for the animators to do all the work. No, rather, they're really *acting* here, imbuing their characters with as much depth and breadth as if they'd been playing flesh-and-blood people.Keep a sharp eye, movie lovers, inside gags abound: When Woody runs from an escaped globe, you'll think it looks just like the giant ball sequence from ""Raiders,"" and you'll be right! When Buzz walks amid a sea of tiny alien squeak-toys, Richard Dreyfuss' close encounter ""...of the Third Kind,"" of course, should echo in your mind.The look of the movie *is* stunning--and, IMO, it ""works"" in every instance but one: Syd's dog. Instead of looking canine, he looks instead like a fur-covered football.I wish Pixar had spent a few more pixels refining his ""look.""But all that's quibbling. Here's a movie for every kid who whiled away an afternoon while sprawled in front of a toy box and for every adult who ever wondered what happens to those Little Tykes people once you turn off the lights and go to bed...","

"TOY STORY","saadanathan","27 November 2020","""Toy Story"" is the first ever film by Pixar Animation Studios, and the film that started the golden age for Pixar. A classic well known movie that everybody loves and remembers after 25 years. The story is so original and creative that it's pretty incredible to imagine how the creators thought of the concept. The idea of toys living and breathing, all aware that they are toys is nothing less than genius. The fact that Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) doesn't even know he is a toy and thinks he's a spaceranger is funny and gives the film a better storytelling. Both characters Woody and Buzz are different from each other, yet have to work together in order to survive. All characters in ""Toy Story"" are amazing, funny and full of characteristic. An extraordinary movie that keeps its good taste even after 25 years, at high level with lots of nostalgia.","

The characters are lovable and are all equally important to the story.I may not have realized back then that I was seeing the first cgi animated feature film but I am somewhat glad I didn't know about that. Having to enjoy the film sincerely is way better than that. It's still a privilege seeing this on it's original date.","

"TOY STORY","Mcduff3601","28 August 2023","I was a teenager when this movie came out and I remember sitting in the theatre blown away by the graphics that were being displayed on the screen. This was cutting edge stuff.Fast forward to 2023 and the graphics are now something to be overlooked as they look dated and nothing like today's movies. However that being said it is the story and the characters that really make this movie shine.There is enough adult stuff going on in the movie that adults will love it and there is enough kid stuff that kids will love it. They do an excellent job of balancing that out so there is enough for everyone.Highly recommend to anyone who wants a light hearted story about friendship or childhood.","

Anyway, we can't avoid the ""Disney touch"" and all those awful songs...So, after ""Toy story"" came other movies that were much better, but this was the first one and it has a relevant position in the history of cinema.*My rate: 6/10","

"TOY STORY","Rainey-Dawn","23 October 2014","This is another one of my ""I should like this movie better than I do"" films. It has an all-star voice-over cast (which I like all of them) - and that is the merit to this film and the story is cute and fun. I did get a few laughs out of the movie so I will not knock the film.So what is it about the film I dislike? The toys - not the actors voicing them - the toys themselves. All of the toys except for Rex (the T. Rex toy). I did enjoy the toon Rex - he was quite the comedy act. Mr. Potato Head was OK in the film but I never liked the toy as a kid - just boring to play with. The rest of the toys (or similar types) never interested me as a kid so they do not appeal to me in this film.It's a shame that I am not keen on this film since I really enjoyed films like ""Monsters, Inc."", ""Shrek"" and ""Chicken Run"".6/10","

"TOY STORY","nickmesafilms","9 July 2011","Disney-PIXAR's first ever CGI-animated movie ""Toy Story"" is one of the best animated movies I have seen in years. The movie brings smart ideas, charming heart, and loving characters including Woody, Buzz, and the rest of the gang of toys. The movie begins with Woody, a cowboy toy, who used to be the star of the toy chest, until this new toy arrives after the owner's birthday, named Buzz Lightyear, a space ranger toy, with beliefs that he's a real space ranger. This leads into fr-enemy rivalry involving these two toys, until they learn the true meaning of friendship. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provide the voices for these well-known characters, and they did a great job of bringing talking toys to life. I thought the movie was excellent at writing some kind of every day diary through the eyes of toys. I think Pixar knows how to push the envelope with great ideas of animation, and they started this success with ""Toy Story"". I thought the movie is excellent in every way, it never leaves a single heart, and we grow up watching this movie and we never get tired of watching the old-fashioned buddy pictures, which made ""Toy Story"" a big success to critics and the box office. I really enjoy watching this movie over and over, and it always takes me back to my childhood. ""Toy Story"", in my review, ""brilliant in every way, and always a loving memory"".","

"TOY STORY","ShootingShark","24 December 2006","The toys in Andy's bedroom are worried when he gets a new Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger for his birthday. Sheriff Woody is jealous, but when he knocks Buzz out of the window by accident, he must face the outside world and go rescue him.Toy Story is a World's First movie. The use of computer-generated animation had been pioneered in other films (Tron, The Last Starfighter, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, etc) and had been used extensively in short films (such as Lasseter's classic Luxo Jr., the origin of the Pixar company desklamp logo), but Toy Story is the original computer-rendered animation movie and its visual dynamics are simply stunning. In particular, the generation of movement through the frame (such as the point-of-view shot of Andy running up the stairs) and the ability to perfectly map any number of light sources to the motion of objects are amazing techniques previously unheard of in standard cell-painted animation. Lasseter and his incredible crew of artists have created an animation world which can duplicate almost anything a three-dimensional live-action movie could. It's an incredible achievement. Much more importantly however, it's a great movie - funny, scary, jam-packed full of great characters, and a terrific story. It has two ideas that are just brilliant; firstly, the central conceit of the toys coming to life, and secondly, Buzz struggling to come to terms with his identity. It kinda reminds me of a kids version of Robocop; on the one hand it's a goofy adventure story but on the other it's really almost a philosophical fable about a guy facing the meaninglessness of existence ! I also love the sheer variety of the toys, both visually and character-wise; as well as Andy's toys, Sid's monstrous hybrids are fabulous and the wacko three-eye greenies are hilarious (""Nirvana is coming ! The mystic portal awaits !!""). The voice cast are terrific, particularly Allen, Shawn and Ermey, and the movie sounds just as good as it looks, with excellent sound design by Gary Rydstrom. My one complaint is Randy Newman's song score, which is okay, but I'm afraid his laid-back LA showtunes style grates with me, and does he really need six credits for it ? Anyway, this is a great movie for everybody, kids and adults alike, and a genuine pleasure to watch. See if you can catch the shot they stole from Close Encounters Of The Third Kind.","

"TOY STORY","stormhawk2021","24 July 2017","Pixar's first major smash hit and one of the first entirely computer animated films may not have aged well, considering the huge steps CGI characters have taken since 1995. Its biggest assets, a huge beating heart and a great sense of humor, still work so many years later and let you forget about the sometimes flat textures. The story, the characters and the jokes are what draws you into the story and soon after you forget you're actually watching an adventure about living toys. The great voice acting helps too, of course. The result, a glorious collection of exciting and fun action scenes, is so perfect, you sometimes feel the urge to clap applause in responds to the events on the screen. The voice cast of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen fit the characters of Woody and Buzz so perfectly, this film should be seen as a major highlight in their careers. From Pizza Planet, to Sid's House and the race for the moving truck, this film features plenty of memorable scenes and locations. Randy Newman's song ""You've Got A Friend In Me"" is undeniably one of the best songs to be featured in a Pixar film, shame it didn't win the Oscar for 'Best Original Song' that it deserved. A classic.PS: Steve Jobs personally funded Pixar to make this film possible. So those who grew up with this film, remember this is another reason on how Jobs changed the world.","

"TOY STORY","imagiking","8 July 2010","With the ever increasing proximity of Toy Story 3, I decided it was about time for me to revisit the original and its first sequel to refresh my memory. Having been among the original target audience, it's a real trip back to childhood.The longtime favourite toy of young Andy, Woody is disgruntled to be pushed aside in favour of a new space-ranger action figure in the form of Buzz Lightyear. Admired by child and fellow toys alike, Buzz threatens Woody's territory, prompting an effort to remove him which results in the two being left many miles from home, with little time to get back before the family's move.Now regarded fondly as one of the best kids' movies of all time, Toy Story was the catalyst which allowed Pixar to rapidly ascend to the throne of animation where they dominantly remain to this day. Certainly it wowed me when I first saw it, almost fifteen years ago now. Indulging every child's fantasy that their toys come to life when they're not looking, we find ourselves instantly aligned with the host of strange characters. The quality of the animation, revolutionary for its time, is seen instantly, proudly boasted in the movements of the soldiers as they march downstairs. Everything looks completely realistic and, most importantly, believable. Whilst amusing beforehand, the laughs only really start to build up when Buzz arrives and we are treated to his interactions with Woody, the disagreements between the two and their petty arguments forming the basis of the film's funny factor. The added maturity of years affords the understanding of some of the film's more adult jokes, adding a little something extra to the experience for returning viewers. The action-adventure side of the plot keeps up the drama, tension, and sense of doom, keeping us wondering whether or not the reluctant duo will ever make it back in time. The scenes in Sid's house are the film's best, in terms of keeping up suspense. Their oddness is stand-out and ever memorable, the stranger toys therein encountered doubtlessly having haunted many little 'uns over the years. Certainly still enjoyable, Toy Story remains an inherently good film, though for me it stands less high than the likes of Wall-E, lacking the considerable emotional impact of that later Pixar effort.Carrying a vast legacy, Toy Story stands the test of time well, still as enjoyable as ever it was. Having paved the way for films which, as you would hope, took what it did and did them better, it is enduring, endearing, and thoroughly entertaining.","

And it of course set the stage for Pixar and Disney to collaborate on well done computer animated features in the years to come: ""Monsters, Inc."" and ""Finding Nemo"".I should identify that although this is G-rated, one of Mr. Potato Head's lines is not exactly G-rated (hint: it deals with a laser).

"TOY STORY","MUFCOK","24 October 2014","Toy Story is one of those movies which holds a lot of good childhood memories for me. I first saw it in the cinema as a child, it was then worn out on VHS tape. Played to death on DVD & is now owned on special edition Blu Ray. It is by far, one of my favourite ever movies. Everything about this movie is perfect. It is a subject which is relateable to every single person who has ever watched this film; that our toys came to life when weren't there. In Toy Story the toys don't just simply come to life, they have their own world, their own relationships, their own problems and conflicts. But above all else they have friendship, loyalty & a special togetherness. The story begins with the Toys in Andy's bedroom. It is the day of Andy's birthday party and the toys gather round anxious awaiting the news as to whether a new toy has been given as a birthday present, and if it is to be Andy's new 'favourite toy'. The toy that is handed over as a present is the brand spanking new, space ranger, Buzz Lightyear. All the other toys are all in awe of him, all toys that is, expect for Woody, Andy's current favourite Toy. Woody feels threatened by Buzz and has no patience when Buzz genuinely believes that he is a real space ranger & not a toy. The story progresses sending the toys on an adventure which is like no other seen before!The casting for Toy Story is simply perfect. Tom Hanks & Tim Allen put in fantastic performances as Woody & Buzz. The relationship they create is so believable and they develop fantastic chemistry throughout the film. The best thing about Toy Story is the way it manages to involve you in the film. It makes you feel all of the toys emotions & really makes you feel for them. But at the end of the day they are just toys! We shouldn't get that involved yet somehow we do! Toy Story has many hidden meanings and gestures which really drive home the message of friendship and love. They are not cheesy, they are touching and realistic. This is what Disney do so well, they make children's films but whilst doing so they create them so they can be related to by adults. The animation is also on the money, this movie is almost 20 years old but looks as good today on Blu Ray as any other animation. Toy Story also has one brilliant soundtrack with several songs which will stay with you long after you have watched it. Overall I cannot recommend this film enough and I would recommend anybody to go and watch it, no matter what your age.A timeless classic. 10/10","

But I certainly never really thought it was the brilliant classic everyone else thought it was. Its animation is great but the story suffers from major pacing issues. There are entire moments of the movie right in the middle that bore me every time and don't stop boring me until I get to the film's climax, when it picks up again. A lot of trimming should have been done in the middle. Toy Story is good but its sequels are a lot better. So is it bad? No. But it's not brilliant.

Woody and the rest of the toys have very good designs that you can't notice the age because of how old you are when you watched this movie for the first time they still hold up this is probably the third best Toy Story film in the franchise I think 4 was worse but 2 and 3 both stood out. I'd say 4,1,3,2 as the order of Toy Story films if I were to rank them, all of them are still A movies guaranteed. Feel free to disagree.

It doesn't hurt that even beyond the technical achievement, the film is charming, well-written, and touching.The toys in question belong to Andy, who has a huge variety of them scattered around his room. The unofficial head toy is Woody, a cowboy toy who has ""been Andy's favorite since kindergarten"". Woody loves being the favored toy, but the order is shaken up when Andy receives a surprise present on his birthday: a Buzz Lightyear action figure, who causes Woody to become jealous when he begins to take over the #1 toy position in Andy's playtime.There's a lot of good stuff in this film: The animation, which mostly still works 15 years later; the voice acting, which is carried out excellently; the story, which keeps viewers engaged throughout. What gets me most about Toy Story is the way that both Woody and Buzz must grow throughout the movie. Woody has to let go of his jealousy and accept that things change when someone new enters the mix. Buzz has to learn (the hard way) that he really is a toy, but that he has a very important role as such. This is better character development than we see in some ""more mature"" films. It was here that Pixar began a long line of memorable, excellently crafted characters.Pixar has released ten feature films in the past fifteen years. Toy Story 3 this summer will make eleven. They've maintained a very high standard of quality during that time. It definitely helps that, with Toy Story, they were off to an excellent start.","

"TOY STORY","action-6","24 March 2000","Toy Story is the first movie made with computers and not using real-life actors. This means that the movie is STUNNING to look at, and worth seeing just for that. However, the story is a bit average, when compared to the likes the classics Pinnochio and Snow White. The movie is good and the animation is a BIG plus, but Pinnochio, Snow White and The Lion King remain my favorites. 8/10","

"TOY STORY","sashank_kini-1","31 May 2007","After hearing about the success of the toy story series, a rented a DVD which had a collection of Toy Story 1, Toy Story 2 and Monsters Inc. I loved Monsters Inc. and Toy Story 2 but I did not enjoy Toy Story 1 even that much. These were the points that I didn't like in the movie: 1) In the starting, when Andy is shown playing with the toys, he starts to get a bit annoying after he keeps on playing with it. His love for the toys throughout the film bugged me after a while. But I did not find this too boring as even my cousin is a great fan of Spiderman and keeps buying and playing with the toys.2) The animation looked a bit faded in the movie. But I didn't pay much attention towards it giving an excuse that it was made in 1995 and compared to Finding Nemo and the other new movies, its animation would be a bit duller.3) Sorry Tom Hanks, but I found your character quite annoying in the film as you kept screaming like a mad character and I did not like you that much.4) Woody's girlfriend in the movie had a terrible voice. I expected a cute shepherdess's voice to be more cute and sweet rather that being a bit rough and sounding like the second woman in a love story.5) Mr.Potato head and the other characters, except for the spring dog, really annoyed me when they were reluctant to listen to Woody. I mean, why couldn't they just wait and understand him.6) The bad boy removed some parts of his toys to make them look terrible. But towards the end, when the toys help Woody and Buzz, Woody thanks them and just leaves. Why didn't he tell the toys to leave that stupid place and run away with them? They should have included these characters in the second film, at least.7) Toys had lives in the movie. So why did they not just start living alive with the humans? Why do they fall still when their masters came? They could play alive with them.The movie had some good points too. Here are some of them: 1) Tim Allen has done a fantastic voicing as Buzz, and I liked Buzz in the movie as he was shown brave, his voicing was done well and he didn't bore me at all.2) The dog who supported Woody was cute and I liked him, just, I liked him, in the movie.3) The movie was different from other movies, as here, toys were shown as the protagonists.4) The dinosaur was funny and his character uplifted the film.Overall, I don't think it deserves to be in the top 250 movies. But its the people's choice and if they wish that it would be in the top 250, then I can do nothing but give my review on the film.","

The climax is really fun but I just don't see the charm that everyone else sees in it. Of course, that doesn't make it a bad film, this film is Pixar's funniest, 2nd being Toy Story 2, and it still has a creative, great story. The thing is, I don't think this movie is an 8/10, but its not a 7/10 either. This is easily a 7.5/10 which is very annoying. Overall this film, although not a phenomenal film, is still VERY funny and is a good watch for the family.","

This may be one of the films that I've seen the MOST, considering I watched it a ton when I was a little kid. So much of my young life was themed around this movie. It remains one of my favorites and is one of the best animated movies of all time. Not to mention it kick-started Pixar's reign of excellence. The animation is starting to look a bit dated, but cmon. It was 1995, this was probably the best animation anyone had ever seen up to that point. The story is perfectly written and the concept is even better. Whoever came up with the idea of talking/walking toys with personalities whenever the kids weren't looking is a genius and should've got a nice fat paycheck. I don't know if this'll end up being the BEST pixar movie after my rewatch, but it will definitely be one of the best. Nostalgia definitely has a factor in it, but even so on a technical level this is one of the beat. Like how could you NOT like this movie?

"TOY STORY","StartingAllOver14","22 September 2007","""Toy Story"" was, as known, the first movie of Pixar that should ""conquest"" the world after Disney's hand-drawn films were consider as mediocre. Except ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Cars"", ""Toy Story"" is the best of all the Pixar films (here comes a little SPOILER; this movie is not presented with the Pixar logo at the beginning of the film, before the title credits. SPOILERS OVER). It's like some TV-series; the first seasons are sometimes the best, right?Anyway, I watch ""Toy Story"" for the first time when I was 11 and I enjoyed it. It's never been my favorite movie of all times, but it's a enjoyable and watchable movie. The animation is gorgeous, the story is simple, but well-defined and the script is good. It's a good idea to make a CGI computer animated movie about toys that comes alive (SPOILERS; when the humans aren't watching. SPOILERS OVER).This film has some more adult humor comparing to the Disney hand-drawn films before 1995, which is quite good. (SPOILER) Most of the characters are simple and well-defined, except the sarcastic Hamm and Mr. Potato Head (not that I dislike them, but they deliver a more sophisticated humor than the rest of the characters). Woody is a more human main character, who makes really big mistakes in the movie, but learn what's wrong and what's right. My favorite characters were Buzz (I absolutely love his lines), Slinky (who stand up for Woody more than he deserves) and Scud, Sid's dog, who definitely should be in the sequel. (SPOILERS OVER).This movie has some scenes that could may be considered a little spooky for the youngest children, but for those who are 8 years old and upward, it's a suitable movie What I didn't like in this film is the score of Randy Newman, who is actually very annoying and too sugary for me. Unfortenaly he became the composer of most of the Pixar's film. But the songs in ""Toy Story"" are working quite all right. Not that they are so memorable, but they don't destroy the movie.So ""Toy Story"" it's a funny and enjoyable movie worth watching.","

"TOY STORY","djansen24","8 September 2011","Pixar strikes out in feature films with its first full-lengther, and the results are stunning! They set the bar almost impossibly high for anyone else interested in getting into full length computer animation. But what made Toy Story have such staying power and make the characters immediately house-hold names wasn't so much the technical brilliance (although it did dazzle), but the storytelling. Okay, case in point. Independence Day. The media hyped this up and it got a lot of viewers. It had a lot of effects. It dazzled our eyes (not our hearts) on the big screen. It sold a lot of DVDs. It made a lot of money...during its run. So who remembers it much now? For that matter, who will remember much of just about any of Roland Emmerich's films years from now? But who can forget Woody, Andy, Buzz, etc.? Who can forget that bedroom? Who can forget Sid? The writers at Pixar took a great idea which was understanding how many of us (even as adults) have emotional attachments to our toys and found a way to bring the heart of that idea and nail it down to a heartwarming story about friendship. That the technical details are flat out amazing for its time was an added bonus (even seeing reflections from Buzz's space helmet -- they didn't have to do that! The animators threw that in just to make the experience all the more special and believable). No other studio has ever come up to the standard set by Pixar. Dreamworks hasn't, though they have made a good film or 2. Sony Pics hasn't, etc. etc. Because they lack a great story to begin with, and when they do land upon one, they muck it up by trying to make it something it isn't. I can almost hear the writers in their studios thinking, ""Well, this is good, but we need to add more adult jokes so that the parent's won't get bored."" Advice, just follow Pixar's example and let the story unfold as it needs to. Pixar got it right and has gotten it right up through Toy Story 3. I fear we may be in for a nadir of creativity as we move into Cars 2, but we'll see...","

"TOY STORY","chrisbishop5000","22 February 2011","This movie is just awesome! Bearing in mind that this was a film from 1994/95, the quality of the realistic 3D animation is stunning and what a perfect way to start a new era! Just as a new form of animation comes to life, a vast number of toys magically come to life when their child-owner Andy is out of the room. Maybe that's a true-to-life symbolisation! From the word go, every single one of those toys have become so famous and iconic. Argos (especially), Toys R Us, Amazon, Woolworths and more have never, since the film's 1995-release, been without stock of them! Like it says in the summary, it's a heart-warming story as well as a funny, super-cool movie about a pull-string ragdoll (Woody) whose popularity is short-lived as Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday as a result of new electronic toys hitting the market proving to be better than a just a ragdoll. Understandably, Woody is jealous of Buzz and can't stand his guts. He's an arrogant, self-interested toy but, more than anything else, an total, utter idiot.All the toys have their own personalities; there's Little Bo Peep who has a soft spot for Woody, Slinky Dog who likes Woody and is very friendly, Rex the world's most IRRITATING dinosaur ever, RC, the RC who revs up and down rather than talks and then there's Mr Potato Head and he is VILE! So, so mean and frequently rude. He seems to have some kind of vendetta against Woody for no reason I can think of. Then, he creates his very own campaign to destroy Woody in order to avenge Buzz when Woody's the one who has felt lonely and unwanted for so long! You'd think it'd put children off the authentic Mr Potato Head by Playskool! Oh yes and there's one more toy I didn't mention - Lenny, the toy-sized pair of binoculars. He was voiced by Joe Ranft who contributed in the story development of ""Toy Story"" and is now sadly no longer on this earth. He was killed when the speed of his car went beyond control, crashed through the wall of a bridge and plunged into the river below. The Pixar team miss him terribly...JOE RANFT 1960-2005","

"TOY STORY","rneil95","3 June 2010","I love Toy Story. Plain and simple, it's a phenomenal film. Not only is it one of the most well-made animated films ever made, it's also one of my favorite films in general. It's incredibly appealing story, the voice acting is perfect, the characters are very likable and fun to watch on screen, and the animation is stellar for it's time.The basic premise of TOY STORY is life seen through the eyes of a toy. The film centers around the toys belonging to a boy named Andy, particularly following his favorite toy, a stuffed cowboy doll named Woody. Woody is primarily the one in charge of Andy's room, but his authority is threatened when Andy gets a new spaceman toy named Buzz Lightyear. The only problem is that Buzz doesn't know he's a toy. He genuinely thinks that he is a real space ranger.Tom Hanks voices Woody and Tim Allen voices Buzz, and both do a stellar job. I couldn't ever imagine anybody voicing these two characters besides Hanks and Allen. The supporting cast does a wonderful job as well, such as Jim Varney as Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as Rex, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Annie Potts as Bo Peep, John Ratzenberger as Hamm, and others. The characters are so fun to watch, and you truly care about them as you watch Woody and Buzz form a friendship. At it's heart, Toy Story is a buddy movie, and one of the best made at that.While the animation seems somewhat dated today when compared to PIXAR's more recent films, the film does still look very nice. Looking back at the film, it truly is a technological achievement as well as a film-making achievement in general.Being the first animated film done entirely through computers, Toy Story had a lot of expectations to meet. And not only does it meet expectations, it surpasses them to infinity and beyond.","

In fact, this film was made more for adults than for children I suspect-much of the humour is subtle and adult oriented, and as the makers admit, many of the toys are ones they played with in their childhoods.The toys in the film are actually better actors, and convey more emotion, than most ""actors"" in films today. Kudos to Pixar for an excellent job.A must-see film, it has something for everyone, and loses nothing on repeated viewing. I saw it 3 times at the cinema, and then bought it on video, and have probably seen it 50 or so times at home, and yet it is still funny, and I will happily watch it again.","

"TOY STORY","Spleen","25 September 1999","Think of momentous years in Hollywood's history like 1927 (the year of the first talkie), 1932 (the first use of three-colour technicolor), 1935 (the first feature in full colour), and 1937 (the first animated feature).  I kept telling myself, in 1995, that I was witnessing something equally ground-breaking and historically important.  And who knows, maybe I was. The four historic films I alluded to above were `The Jazz Singer', `Flowers and Trees', `Becky Sharp' and `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', only the last of which has any claim to being a classic.  `Toy Story' has no great claim, either.  In retrospect it was nothing new, just another instance of Hollywood's current infatuation with computer-generated images: pleasant, light and unremarkable.Computer animation is really a soulless device and, although I found it enjoyable, this is a soulless movie.  To begin with the animation wasn't quite ripe.  Toys, I suppose, are easy to animate: but when the flesh-and-blood children start to look as if they're also made of plastic, when the whole world seems to be made of plastic, the eye longs in vain for something else.Perhaps including children at all was a mistake.  A Hans Andersen toy story, a story that concerned toys and only toys, would have been more fun (and more moving).  The film betrays itself when it starts to think of the children.  The two central characters, after all, are BAD toys - horribly gimmicky devices that children very sensibly lose interest in after not so sensibly getting their parents to buy them some other worthless gimcrack. When Woody gave his speech about how important they really were in servicing a child's dreams and wishes and whatnot ... did anyone really fall for it? It would have been much more honest if he'd said, every toy for himself, kids be damned.I'm sorry if I sound overly critical - as I said, I liked it, so for me at least the slightly sour taste wasn't strong enough to ruin the film.  John Lasseter deserves credit for taking a formulaic buddy tale and breathing genuine life into it.  (All the more credit with a medium as unyielding as computer animation.)  `Toy Story' is pleasant and fun.  But frankly, every single traditionally animated film Disney has made from 1989 on, with the possible exception of `The Hunchback of Notre Dame', is better.  And - sorry to close with a carp - did Randy Newman really have to break into song so often?  Wasn't it enough for him to write the score, without croaking his songs out over it?","

"TOY STORY","wolverinesforever","22 December 2015","What more can be said? 20 years ago, Pixar released ""Toy Story,"" and the rest is animation history. Computer animation has since become the dominant form of animation. Dreamworks, Warner Brothers, and Universal (and maybe some other companies I have forgotten) have created their own computer animation studios to rival Pixar. Pixar themselves would continue to push just how far animation could go, both in animation quality and in storytelling ambition. So one may wonder, 20 years after this all got started, is the one that started it all still excellent by today's standards? The answer is an emphatic YES.The story is fairly well known by now, but I'll repeat it anyway for those who are unfamiliar. This ""Toy Story"" centers around the toy cowboy Woody (wonderfully voiced by Tom Hanks). Woody is the favorite toy of the young boy Andy (John Morris), who has several other toys, including Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Slinky Dog (the late Jim Varney), and Hamm the Piggy Bank (John Ratzenberg, whose consistent appearances in Pixar films has become a running gag of sorts - and was acknowledged as such in ""Cars""). The film starts on Andy's birthday party, a time when all of his toys get nervous, because Andy might get a toy that he likes more than the others. Sure enough, he's received the latest ""cool"" toy, spaceman Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen, an inspired choice). This results in Woody being demoted to ""second best,"" something he doesn't take well at all. Woody attempts to push Buzz out of the way so he can get back to being Andy's favorite toy, but through a series of mistakes (and misadventures), he winds up making both he and Buzz separated from their owner Andy. Worse, they end up in the possession of their neighbor, Sid (Erik von Detten), who prefers to blow up his toys instead of play with them. Now Woody and Buzz have to make peace and work together if they are to return to Andy (oh, and did I mention that Andy is moving away soon?).The premise is simple enough, but it's in the execution where things get very inspired. Take, for example, how the toys attempt to learn what presents Andy is receiving. They send several Army Men Toy Soldiers down for a ""Code Red"" mission, and how these soldiers pull this off always puts a smile on my face. I still remember being inspired by watching the soldiers move that radio into that small leafy plant on the bottom floor (I was seven when I first saw this). I was so inspired, in fact, that a year later, I was ""teaching"" my toys how to hide in the Christmas tree during Christmas. Director John Lasseter and the Pixar team have deeply considered how a world of toys would work. How would a toy feel about getting relegated to ""second best"" when a new toy comes around? And it's pretty fun to see how the toys have to consistently make sure the ""human world"" never knows about their awareness.And the strength of this script goes beyond its consideration of a world of toys. Its tight and to the point. There are no wasted moments in the film's (short) 81-minute runtime. Pixar is not satisfied with simply showing what computer animation can do. They are interested in guiding along through a story that provides laughs, thrills, an occasional scare, and something valuable to learn at the end.Obviously, the quality of computer animation has improved greatly since this film first came out (watch how they animate a dog here, and compare it to how Pixar would animate Sullivan's fur in ""Monster's Inc."", for example). But let's remember, at the time, this was considered to be massively advanced animation. Many adult critics wondered if kids would realize just how big of a breakthrough this was in the history of animation, but I can reassure them, I may have been only 7 years old, but even I realized an entirely computer animated film was a very big deal indeed! Looking back now, I do think we should consider some of the things the animators did in this film that further emphasized what computer animation should be going for. Gene Siskel pointed out that you could see a reflection off of Buzz's helmet (and even stated, as a compliment, ""They didn't have to do that!""). The toys, the settings, everything was beautifully rendered and still looks good today. Even if one just reduced this picture to its visual qualities (inadvisable), they would still come out quite satisfied.Today officially marks the 20 year anniversary of when I saw this film (December 22nd, 1995), and it's high time I got to writing a review of it. ""Toy Story"" absolutely changed movies, and that is not a hyperbole. It's popularity made others realize the financial potential in computer animation. It's quality made everyone realize just what computer animation could (and should) pull off, both in visuals and storytelling. Pixar themselves would start a very long winning streak of highly acclaimed pictures, with many seemingly getting even more glowing reviews then the picture before it (heck we've gotten two great ""Toy Story"" sequels to boot). That this film still holds up even though many envelope pushing animated pictures have been released since is impressive indeed.20 years later, ""Toy Story"" still rocks!","

This movie show some kind of magic, that I can't explain, and just fascinates me.Revolutionary, ""Toy Story"" was the first of all the great 3D animated movie. It's voice casting is just perfect, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen give memorable performances (Like the scene where Woody yells at Buzz ""You are a toy!"") making this movie unforgettable. The animation itself is great, although nowadays animated movies are a little bit better animated. The songs in this film are moving and exciting sometimes, witch gives a beautiful touch to the movie.But that's not the best part of it. The problems and dilemmas that the characters experience, are so good, that it may sound a little too complex to a kid's movie, the fact that buzz can't be real astronaut and that he has to settle with being just a toy is just brilliant, and like I said before, uncommonly intelligent. And also the situation where Woody has to prove his ""Ex-friends"" that he didn't kill Buzz, that is for me what makes this film different than any other animated film (""UP"" also has an intelligent plot, but the execution is not as good as this one).Verdict: Magical, touching, and quite brilliant, ""Toy Story"" is a lot of fun.","

"TOY STORY","arc_a2007","10 September 2007","Here's another film I watched back-to-back every day for a couple of weeks, when I was younger. I recently picked up the DVD and was instantly pulled in again. I ended up watching it again two days later. Anyway, I must point out that watching it when you're a child and watching it when you're an adult will result in two different experiences. Watching it recently I laughed my arse off at jokes I didn't even know were jokes back then; even simple things like ""Buzz LightBeer"" can have quite an impact.Alright then, enough of that. The film is 100% perfect the way it is. The characters are so full of personality, so full of humanity, and how it perfectly expresses emotions of loneliness, rejection, and love through a couple of toys is astounding. The movie has a sort of episodic appeal to it, wherein each episode leads to one collective end. It also seems that the worst that can happen to our protagonists does happen. It makes for one unpredictable plot. There's plenty of darkness here, especially with the whole Sid scenario, or when Buzz tries to fly. Did I mention the soundtrack? Randy Newman was perfect for this job; the music has a childish aura to it, but also helps accentuate the emotions of certain scenes. Can't imagine why he wasn't asked to work on the sequel. Anyway, Toy Story has received countless awards, and it is my opinion they are deserved.","

"TOY STORY","ametaphysicalshark","4 June 2009","Afraid this doesn't really hold up that well. You hear so much about great wit, but that comes only in short fits, a few good lines here and there. I know they're toys, but the characters in ""Toy Story"" largely suffer from the sort of super-quirk ""Juno"" and ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and the lot suffer from. It's basically really quirky toys talking to each other and facing acts of villainy and committing acts of heroism for an hour and a half. The animation is impressive considering when it was made but unlike hand-drawn animation from the old Disney films it HAS dated, and noticeably, often looking like a video game cutscene now. The voice work is fine, but there's just nothing truly interesting about this world or these characters. It's a pleasant enough movie and occasionally very fun, but the overwhelming affection for it seems to me the result of nostalgia and memory rather than any lasting value. Compared to the rip-roaring adventure of ""The Incredibles"", the spine-tingling melancholy tone and sophisticated ideas of ""WALL-E"", or the sense of longing and loss and adventure in ""Up"", ""Toy Story"" falls short. Very short. In fact, I'd much rather take the small-town nostalgia of ""Cars"" over this. A good starting point for Pixar but nothing even remotely approaching a classic.","

"TOY STORY","tonyum","13 August 2022","It´s about time we review another Pixar film, but the question is which one? Well, how about their first one. Toy Story, released in 1995, was the one that started it all, and not just the Toy Story franchise and Pixar as a whole, but the medium of 3D animation (the premiere form of animation and the only animation medium that makes money nowadays), and what a bang it started on.Its obvious selling point is the animation, which was not only groundbreaking at the time, like I said before, but it really captures the essence of a toy with the models´plasticky look, and it´s greatly detailed in some areas.Another great thing is the story. While the trope of ""character doesn´t like the new guy who gets more attention than him"" is a very common trope found in kids films today (even the general concept of toys coming to life itself was very common back in the day), this is the one that pulls it off the best, with several underlying themes of identity crisis, hopelessness, friendship and the true meaning of a toy, wether old or new, while also telling the best redemption story of a jerk character (even if Woody can be a bit too mean and shouty in some instances, but it´s better than the deleted ""Black Friday Toy Story reel"" Woody).Speaking of which, the characters are endearing and unique in their own way, with distinct, memorable and charming personality, further enhanced by the amazing performances by actors such as Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, and the fantastic humor.The last great thing about this movie is the classic Randy Newman score, consisting of several unforgettable songs like ""You got a friend in me"", ""Strange Things"", ""I Will Go Sailing No More"", I could go on.If there´s one thing bad I could say about Toy Story 1 is, while this was the first fully computer-animated movie, the animation, while still amazing and still good to this day, can look a bit dated in some areas, such as the models for the humans and dogs and a couple of facial expressions. That said, however, it´s still overall great and up-to-date (so to speak) with our modern standards. And hey, some of these dated moments gave us some good memes and YouTube Poops in the future, so there´s that.But overall, Toy Story is fantastic in almost every area, with a great story, good visuals, a great sense of humor, great messages, an amazing score and one of the most likeable and memorable cast of characters that I´ve seen in a kids movie. While it may not top its first two sequels, it´s still a grand old time even to this day, wether you´re a kid or an adult.","

"TOY STORY","ilikepuppies","19 May 2007","The opening scene says it all. Film-making begins in early childhood, as children use their toys to create little scenes (or movies if you will). The word ""play"" when used to describe such activity indeed derived from the movies of another era, plays. Or perhaps the other way around. Either way, the point of this film is to show that creating a film and playing with toys are virtually the same thing.So the film is basically about itself. A play about playing. This is exactly the type of multi-layered construction that I believe subconsciously challenges and nurtures our kids' minds. Teaching a child (or adult!) to think on more than one level at a time is simply a gift.It should also be applauded that it's all substance and no fluff. Other animation teams have inundated their films with meaningless pop culture gags, camp, and nostalgic irony. Not to mention an abundance of toilet humor. Music by the great Randy Newman instead of the Village People.None of the mindless pandering to adults here, either, yet we are included in the fun by being subtly reminded of our own play days. Barrel of Monkeys. Potato Heads. In fact there is a strong undercurrent theme here as the classic cowboy toy is threatened by the flashy new space man who is obviously being pushed on kids via a relentless marketing campaign. We 30-somethings must root for Woody. It's Wal-mart vs. our favorite mom-n-pop corner store.These Pixar guys are brilliant, and I believe they will be revered someday as perhaps the most important influence in all of filmdom during the turn of this century's period. There is no more sure thing than a Pixar offering. Always compelling, engaging, intelligent and abstract. And this one is the best.","

Toy Story is about a boy named Andy who, like most of us, had many toys as a kid, but there was always that one special toy that we just played with all the time. For him, it was cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks from ""Big"", ""Apollo 13"", ""Saving Private Ryan"") who feels he'll never be replaced. That all changes on Andy's birthday when he gets a cool spaceman toy, Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen, from the hit 90's sitcom ""Home Improvement"") and all of a sudden, Buzz is his new favorite toy. After ending up stuck in a game machine where ""The Claw"" picks both of them up and a dangerous boy named Sid (voiced by Erik von Detten), has some pretty evil plans for them. This movie has everything a good movie should have: great story, amazing, unforgettable characters, good music score and songs composed by Randy Newman, and some great messages on friendship. Other voices talents include Jim Varney as Slinky, John Ratzenberger as Mr. Potato Head, Don Rickles as Ham, and Wallace Shawn as Rex. Will Woody and Buzz learn to coexist? Can they with the help of some mutant toys foil Sid's evil plans? The only way to find out: Watch Toy Story. You should and I hope won't be disappointed if you haven't seen it. Rating:10/10!","

And only then did I realize what an absolutely wonderful movie this was.The existing reviews already cover all the things that make it so good and I'm not sure I can add much too what has already been said.

There's a lot to like about this picture; part of it's the cool animation and creative voicing, part of it's the clever use of sight gags that young kids would have no idea about, like the Binford Tool Box and the Punisher logo on Sid's shirt. I guess it's good to be old enough to have that perspective.With only nominal appearances by the 'humans' in the movie, the picture stayed true to it's mission of presenting Andy's toys as if they were living and thinking creatures. They had their own favorites, showed emotion, and helped teach the lesson of having a friend by being a friend. When things looked bleak in Sid's back yard, the misfit toys even managed to violate their own prime directive, that is, they allowed Sid to see they were 'real' in order to help Woody and Buzz. I wonder if Sid ever got over it.I read a dozen or so of the other comments on the picture and no one mentioned Randy Newman in their reviews. I'm sure someone did, but let me add my voice to that minority. ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" is a perfect accompaniment to the picture, and fits it like a glove.

Of course he does get a shiny new toy, a Buzz Lightyear action figure. which is Andy's new favourite. Woody is upset about this and plots to get Buzz lost behind a dresser, unfortunately this goes wrong and Buzz is knocked out of the window. Since Andy can't find Buzz he picks up Woody when he is taken to ""Pizza Planet"". Outside Woody is finds Buzz but is soon separated from Andy. The two of them unite to try to get back to Andy but things take turn for the worse when they are ""captured"" by Andy's evil neighbour Sid, a horrid child who likes to destroy toys. Things go from bad to worse when Buzz learns that he is merely a toy and not the real Buzz Lightyear as featured on a TV show.Obviously this is a children's film but that doesn't mean adults can't enjoy it just as much, it is a great story that just happens to be about toys that come alive. The characters are all well designed and as a viewer I cared about what happened to them. This film is clearly destined to be a classic as it isn't bogged down with pop culture references which would cease to be funny in a few years.

And the use of many established comic talents like Don Rickles, Annie Potts, John Ratzenberger (who would become a regular Pixar voice), the late Jim Varney, and especially, Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear. And as with previous Disney animated features, Randy Newman provides such an enjoyably compelling music score as well as several enjoyable songs with a great theme song in ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" that he warbled with Lyle Lovett. And the recent 3-D version just adds to the experience!

"TOY STORY","michaelRokeefe","15 June 2010","Just who knew how well this Disney-Pixar collaboration would be accepted. While a little boy Andy(John Morris)is out of his room his toy collection becomes very mobile. A pull-string cowboy named Woody(Tom Hanks)is the leader of the toy community featuring Mr. Potato Head(Don Rickles), piggy bank Hamm(John Ratzenberger), Slinky Dog(Jim Varney)and Bo Peep(Annie Potts). Woody's authority becomes challenged by a high-tech space ranger named Buzz Lightyear(Tim Allen). While Woody and Buzz deal with their rivalry, the group of toys need to band together to survive the kid next door Sid(Erik Von Detten), who thrives on feeding stuffed animals and toys to his vicious dog. Very fun to watch and whole family appropriate. Other voices featured: Laurie Metcalf, Wallace Shawn, Sarah Freeman and R. Lee Ermey.","

"TOY STORY","CinemaSerf","27 August 2023","Every now and again when you watch antiques programmes on television and somebody turns up with a toy in it's original box - that turns out to be worth more than his car - I regret that I no longer possess any from my childhood. I do recall, however, being especially fickle - the favourite one day was never likely to reign long before being supplanted by another. That's the case here for cowboy ""Woody"". He is the favourite of owner ""Andy"" amongst, it has to be said, rather a lot of different ones. Until, that is - one birthday, we meet Space Ranger ""Buzz Lightyear"". He's actually quite an affable chap, but the green eyed monster is now in charge and ""Woody"" tries to relegate his successor down the side of the bed. That goes wrong and, accidentally, out of the window he goes. The other toys are horrified, leaving ""Woody"" with no option but to get over his laser envy, rescue his new rival and repatriate him before the whole family move to a new home! What now ensues are some fun escapades, near misses and they fall into the hands of another young boy who really does want to blast ""Buzz"" into space. The vocal talents of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are enthusiastic and entertaining, those of Don Rickles (""Mr. Potato Head"") sometimes a little nearer the bone for the grown ups and they are all helped along by a good soundtrack and a wittily written script offering us plenty of scenarios that draw the viewer (of whatever age) into this simple, pretty timeless story. It's interesting, for 1995, to note the wide variety of toys this young boy has, too - no gender stereotyping, which is quite refreshing. This is quickly paced and enjoyable animation that touches on the values of trust, companionship and team spirt - as well as the demerits of envy and selfishness - and I really enjoyed it.","

"TOY STORY","neil-476","7 October 2009","It was a classic on the day it was released, and it's still a classic 10 years later. The story is great, the characters are great, the voice talent is great, and the animation is great. Only the detail suffers by comparison with current computer animated films, but that is perhaps only to be expected.I was surprised and delighted to note Joss Whedon at the top of the list of those responsible for the screenplay - his name means a lot more to me now than it did 10 years ago.This 3D retooling is interesting. For one thing, it demonstrates that it is a relatively easy exercise for CGI animated features. Having said that, it doesn't add an awful lot to Toy Story. Given that the film wasn't envisaged as a 3D feature, there aren't any sequences specifically designed to showcase 3D. The climactic chase and rocket scene works well, and there are scattered moments which make you go, ""Oh, look!"" But nothing which makes you go ""Wow!"" In the way the trailer (created specially for this 3D version) did.But watching Toy Story, 2D or 3D, is never a waste of time - it's that good.","

"TOY STORY","anaconda-40658","3 February 2016","Toy Story (1995): Dir: John Lasseter / Voices: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, Jim Varney: Breakthrough first fully computer animated film and what a wondrous triumphant visual thrill it is. It is a film for families that will appeal on different grounds depending on age. It regards a cowboy named Woody and the jealousy that erupts when Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear enters the room on their owner's birthday. Buzz is interesting because he doesn't realize that he is a toy. When Woody causes Buzz to fall out a window an adventure begins that eventually lands them both in nasty Sid's bedroom from next door where a dire fate awaits toys. Grand idea with imaginative filmmaking by director John Lasseter. Where the film goes wrong is its placing supporting characters as types with little purpose. The two leads carry the film with Tom Hanks voicing Woody who goes from important to jealousy to hero in an exciting climax. Tim Allen as Buzz brings much humour in his inability to accept what he is. There is a host of other toys that seem more like fillers. Don Rickles voices Mr. Potato Head and Wallace Shawn voices T-Rex. Jim Varney of Ernest P. Worrell fame voices the loyal Slinky Dog. It contains a theme of love and friendship and for adults it addresses the future of films. Grand achievement, or as the toys put it, ""To infinity and beyond!"" Score: 9 / 10","

"TOY STORY","Mr-Fusion","27 February 2023","It made waves back in the '90s and put PIXAR on the map, but how well does ""Toy Story"" hold up? Surprisingly well, actually. You can probably poke holes if you really want to (the rendering of the humans, mostly), but it still retains the charm of seeing these toys come to life. Hanks and Allen both leave their marks on Woody and Buzz, respectively (it's part of the reason I was never able to buy Warburton's Buzz on the TV show, awesome though he is) and the rest of the cast all seem to fit perfectly.All of the funny lines came flooding back, and this rewatch was just a treat all around. The songs are good, these are memorable characters, and it's still a testament to creativity.","

"TOY STORY","ersbel","16 June 2013","Amazing! I have just seen Toy Story. The first one. For the first time. And it's like I'm seeing it back in the days before Toy Story 2 got out on the big screen. The only thing I wouldn't have known was the future story of Apple Inc.This is a wonderful one hour advertisement where you can see branded toys. The only thing that is original in this one hour waste is the way Steve Jobs' employees created a toy universe. It was so yesterday to create a new line of cheap plastics than do some silly adventure. It was called an adventure so people won't have any issue leaving the children alone for one or two hours of advertisements. It sounds so much more educative to have cartoon adventure instead of having cartoon characters selling you stuff. And, instead of a real actor, the cartoon has precisely zero morals: it can sell plutonium to a 5 year old or to some radical terrorist group without blinking. Unless the art director thinks the blink would raise the quantity at least 10 percent.Now about the creative part. Steve Jobs' employees never bothered to create something like say Hanna-Barbera. They just pushed older toys into this new advertisement. And here's where the creativity ends.What's even better is the world imagined. A world where children are isolated. Where they depend on their branded toys. And watch out for the bad kid! He is real creative. But the toys are working together to bring back what the lower case 'c' in a circle meant: a toy identical with million others on the shelves. Oh! And don't forget! A good kid would preserve all the junk: large useless wasteful boxes with advertisements for the whole line of plastic somethings.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch","

"TOY STORY","paulclaassen","3 February 2024","What do toys do when kids stop playing with them? Well, 'Toy Story' might provide some answers.As the title indicates - and as you'll see from the characters - 'Toy Story' is definitely more of a kids film. In every sense this is a beautifully animated cartoon kids will love watching over and over again. They will laugh at the antics the toys get up to, they will love the characters that might resemble some of the toys in their own room, and they will enjoy the story. It is a simple, easy to follow premise.Thanks to adding elements of danger and adventure, and themes adults can relate to, the film also has a mature appeal. Thus, 'Toy Story' is perfect for the entire family. But what is this story about? Andy is a young boy who lives in a nice neighbourhood and his favourite toy is a cowboy doll named Woody (who is wonderfully voiced by Tom Hanks). He has several other toys and when Andy is not around, they all come to life and have their own adventures.Then Andy gets a brand new, modern toy for his birthday: Buzz Lightyear - a space action figure. Buzz Lightyear soon becomes Andy's favourite toy, and this sparks jealousy in Woody. But when Woody accidentally knocks Buzz Lightyear out the window, it becomes Woody's mission to save him.There's plenty of action and adventure that follows and 'Toy Story' is sure to entertain kids (and adults!) from beginning to end. Sit back, relax, and see what the toys are up to when you're not watching!","

"TOY STORY","thesar-2","11 October 2009","I told a friend I was going to re-watch 'Toy Story' in the theater due to it being a ""classic"" in which he immediately disputed. I disagree. Much like 1977's 'Star Wars' or 'Citizen Kane,' 'Toy Story' was far before it's time and revolutionized it's genre, in this case: animation. In addition, they took it to the next level with creativity, a perfect combination of humor for both kids and adults as well as an excellent homage to toys people around my age grew up with. I was at the tail-end to some of the toys shown or in the middle when I was a child. So, of course, a great deal of smiles were on my face throughout in remembrance. But, as a movie-lover/amateur critic, it has to go beyond that. I won't like a movie without a great and original script/dialogue, deep characters, good pacing and surprises. This movie has them all. I loved the lines, the voices were pitch perfect, the adventure made up from just from imagination was inventive from minute one and all characters intersected beautifully. Just as child Andy's birthday party is to start, every toy (alive when no one else is around) is worried they'll be replaced and current head-toy cowboy Woody attempts to convince them otherwise. Unfortunately, it is he that's replaced by Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear (love the variances to his name, including ""Light-beer"") who seemingly doesn't know he is anything but an astronaut. Not too far deep into the story is a touching realization/awakening for both and great learning for the people watching, kids and adults alike. Excellent movie, perfect start for the apparently unbeatable Pixar studios and suitable for all ages. (Side note: 2009's 3-D version worth watching, but adds little to the already masterpiece it is.)","

"TOY STORY","eeg1587-184-998241","12 December 2014","Toy Story was the first fully animated movie that released in 1995. Starring Tom Hanks as Woody who brings life to the cowboy pull- string doll. Buzz Lightyear, played by Tim Allen brought the right attitude for the newest addition to Andy's (John Morris) toy collection. The story takes us back to the day where we played with toys and used our imaginations to create our own stories. When Andy would leave the room the toys would come to life. A week before Andy's birthday, with his family moving, he is given a party to spend with friends before they leave. The toys plot a way to discover Andy's new presents. After the party the other toys discovered Buzz is one of the presents Andy's receives before he leaves. The main theme of the story to me is ""friendship."" It's a great story relaying the message to be kind to everyone because you never really know when you might need them and your enemy could be your best friend in the end. After all, ""You've got a friend in me.""Woody doesn't want to lose top spot as favorite toy so he plots to get rid of Buzz. He starts with a master plan that leaves the both of them in a situation to help each other to get home. The rich colors and 3D animation gives the movie a more realistic feeling as if it were drawn. It is the lighting, modeling, computer graphics and animations are what bring this movie to life. The shading of certain objects, cracks or spills could be the difference between a human look or manufactured. The lighting had to be hard to create the film. They had some dramatic moody lights in Sid's room, flashlight stuff, daylight, bright sun for all sorts of different kinds of environments.When they add light it gives more a visual interest for viewers and hide some flaw in animation. Andy's room gives a sense of a happy, friendly and safe place because the brightness in the room gives that affect. This is an overall great film introducing a new way of animations!","

In addition it presents wonderful characters voiced by stars like Tom Hanks and Tim Allen who made them household names.It is famous for being the first blockbuster movie to use 3D visuals and they still hold up strongly 27 years later. If you grew up on 2D animation as I did, this was a historic piece of art within the industry. I had mixed feelings at the time because I love the old way and Pixar rendered it more or less obsolete with this release.The sound effects and music play a huge part in the overall entertainment, with a classic Disney tune like 'You Got A Friend In Me' instantly recognisable.","

"TOY STORY","Rectangular_businessman","3 October 2010","Having recently seen the excellent Toy Story 3, I really wanted to go back and watch this film again. I haven't seen it in many years, but I remembered most of the scenes if not the exact detail and execution, and of course with an older eye I have a better appreciation for what's going on.This is just about as good of a ""first computer animated film"" as could be hoped for. One thing I can say is that the humor, while not sophisticated or adult, is more intelligent than I remembered. It's a movie designed for a young audience, but the writers realized that as many adults will be watching its debut for the spectacle of computer animation, and it's clever for this group in a way that would fly over their children's' heads.The plot line is simpler than I recalled, which is to be expected. One thing that surprised me is the relative one-dimensionality of the characters, especially when compared to Toy Story 2, which has been my mental standard for the characters for many years, and Toy Story 3. Woody is jealous but devoted, Buzz is delusional, Slinky is loyal, Mr. Potato Head is suspicious, etc. These aren't characters so much as they're adjectives. However, the voice actors do an all-around great job. I may just be saying that because I've known who Woody and Buzz are long before I knew who Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were. Ultimately, the simplicity of the characters matches the concise nature of the film.In fact, having watched this again the best way I can think of to describe this movie is that it's basically a really long short film. Which is not at all to say that its plot is artificially stretched; quite the contrary. It's lean and compact like a short film is, it just happens to not be short.All in all, watching this film again has lead me to believe that Toy Story 2 is underrated. Toy Story's sequel is understood by many to be an action-packed film appealing almost exclusively to kids, but that film was where some of the more mature themes that would be brought to their logical conclusion in Toy Story 3 first appeared. In addition, many of the characters, particularly Buzz, aren't nearly as fleshed out until the second one. Toy Story is a cartoon, but Toy Story 2 is an animated film, and that is the difference.That said, this movie holds up very well and I will always hold it close to my heart. There are rarely more joyous moments in film than ""falling with style.","

"TOY STORY","meydianarizki","29 October 2020","Y'know, I always suspected that my toys were coming to life when I wasn't looking!In Andy's Room, his toys lead lives of noisy desperation come every birthday and Christmas - no one wants to be one-upped by a new addition to the toy box. Nominally led by Cowboy Woody (there's a Brokeback joke in there just waiting to happen), Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Ham the piggybank, Bo Peep, Slinky the dog and a smattering of other playthings go about their toy business of playing checkers, hanging with the hometoys and ""plastic corrosion awareness meetings,"" until Andy's birthday party, when they gather expectantly around a transistor radio, listening to the reports of their toy soldier troops ""in the field"" (downstairs watching Andy's gift-opening), hoping that no gift will be exciting enough to cause Andy to neglect *them.* There is. His name is Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger.Directed by Pixar mainstay John Lasseter, with the voice talents of Tom Hanks (as Woody), Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger (forever Cliff from *Cheers*), R. Lee Ermey, Annie Potts, Jim Varney and Tim Allen (as Buzz), *Toy Story* is that *rara avis* that succeeds on all levels - in its animation, storyline, character development, its messages of friendship and self-realization and, most importantly, its entertainment value. The fact that this is a cartoon (or animated feature - just what DO we call this new wave of computer-generated movies?) is incidental. Which makes the slightly dodgy animation (of the ""real people"") irrelevant - it gets the point across with or without the technological finesse.The ""Disney Movie"" has become synonymous with maudlin messages, redneck fundamentalism, anachronistic family values, boneheaded parents, smart-mouthing youngsters, too-hip-to-be-smart teens and insufferable pets. Though Disney's tyrannical umbrella overarches this film's production studio, Pixar Animation, *Toy Story* somehow avoided all trace of Disney's craven hand, which is doubly surprising, considering this is Pixar's first feature length film, after years of experimentation. Right outa the gate and right outa the field.Sure, there are ""messages,"" but they are heartfelt, rather than maudlin (Woody tells Buzz during Buzz's greatest depression that it matters not what Buzz thinks of himself, what makes him important is what his owner, Andy, thinks of him); there are emotional segments, which are truly heartbreaking, rather than cheesy (when Buzz's escape attempt lands him with a broken arm, proving he is Not A Flying Toy, the lyric, ""Clearly I will go sailing no more,"" launches a thousand hankies); and the portrayal of Andy's family was Pixar's triumphal achievement. Boldly contravening Disney's *idée fixe* of the 1950's nuclear family and Norman Rockwell fantasies, one of the many incarnations of a modern-day family is presented: a single mother with two kids, who are neither geniuses nor monsters, just normal children; happy to visit Pizza Planet and disappointed when favorite toys are lost.Buzz - who believes he is a real life space ranger on a mission to save the universe - become Andy's favorite toy over Woody. The funny thing is: though Buzz believes he is real, he still adheres to toy protocol of ""playing inert"" when humans are in the area. (Maybe it's instinct?) When he mentions saving a toy from Sid, the vicious boy next door, how does he propose to do it if he is to adhere to the inert protocol? Buzz's ingenuousness regarding his role as a toy infuriates Woody to the point of attempted toy-assassination. Through a concatenation of accidents, both he and Buzz become lost and must use teamwork, trust and ingenuity to beat their path back to Andy, which finds them ensconced in scorchingly funny vignettes (Buzz fastening himself in an over-sized seatbelt; both falling in with green, three-eyed aliens; Buzz hyperventilating as ""Mrs. Nesbitt""). During a climactic rocket ride, the callback line, ""This is not flying - this is falling with style,"" simply seals this movie's greatness.At least I now have a plausible explanation as to why my toys always got lost: after going about their toy business, they would just go inert anywhere they happened to be, instead of paying attention to their master's infallible toy filing system.","

It is truly a brilliant concept. Young Andy's cowboy doll Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) becomes jealous when Andy starts paying more attention to his new space toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). Buzz, however, does not grasp the fact that he's actually a toy and thinks he is a space ranger here by mistake. Hanks and Allen are the perfect voices for these characters, as are Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, and numerous others. There are more great one-liners in this film than any other family film I can recall, one of the best being Buzz's ""I don't believe that man's ever been to medical school."" I have seen this film countless times, and it has become a true classic. It's masterfully done, not only being the first fully computer animated film, but also for it's superb writing and concept. Everything about the film, from the staff meeting scene in the beginning to Buzz seeing his TV ad, is perfectly done. Randy Newman's three original songs are all excellent. ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" lost to Pochahontas' ""Colors of the Wind,"" which I also love, but I'm not sure which was better; maybe this. Anyway, see this film.

I mean it wasn't good as when I first saw it when it came out when I was in elementary school, but it was still pretty entertaining and brought back some memories. The animation was amazing, and phenomenal when it first came out and still holds up today. The voice actors even did a great job, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen did a great job with there performance in portraying Woody and Buzz Lightyear. It was a exciting adventure, although the plot was simple it was effective and entertaining.The story is about toys coming to life, but keeping themselves secret by acting like they aren't alive. But the toys coexist with humans peacefully, except the toys in Andy's room get worried on birthdays and Christmases of being replaced. Thus when Andy's favorite toy get replaced by a new favorite toy, the conflict starts from there when the older toy that was Andy's favorite tries to hide the new toy, but ends up hitting it out the window. Although this day and age, kid's who are about Andy' age probably won't play with the types of toys portrayed in the movie, and the magic was sort of lost from when I saw it when I was in elementary.

"TOY STORY","llltdesq","22 September 2015","This was Pixar's first feature-length film, the first full-length computer-animated feature film and the first film in the Toy Story series. There will be spoilers ahead: I could just say that this is a phenomenal film, a ground-breaking film and a must watch if you love film in general and/or animation in particular and leave it at that, but this comment would be rather thin if I did so, so I'll do a bit more here.I don't really need to discuss the plot, because, chances are, if you're reading this, you've probably seen this already. I'll do a brief sketch: this concerns a boy named Andy and his toys. Lifeless when humans are around, the toys come to life when none are in the room. Woody is the leader of the toys, but his place is threatened by a new toy, Buzz Lightyear. Andy and family are preparing to move. Through a series of mishaps, Woody and Buzz wind up being lost and must make their way back before the family leaves or be separated from Andy forever. After a series of adventures, they make it back and get on board before the family is gone.That's a simple story. The parts of the film are each so excellently crafted that it takes a simple story and creates gold. The animation still holds up, even after 20 years, which is an eternity in computer animation. The script is marvelous and the writers clearly show that they possess a love for both toys and film. The toys showing up in here are a mix of new (Woody and Buzz) and classic (Mr. Potatohead, Etch-a-Sketch and green army soldiers). There are gags referencing films as diverse as Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Wizard of Oz. Pixar also references the various shorts they'd made up to that point and TV shows like Star Trek and The Simpsons.The voice casting is spot on. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen nailed their parts. Don Rickles and Jim Varney were inspired casting choices and John Ratzenberger began an association with Pixar which continues today. The score and songs by Randy Newman are perfect, particularly the song, ""You've Got a Friend In Me"", which goes to the heart of the film. It's just an exceptional film.The attention to detail is incredible. Even minor characters turn out to have a significant influence on things, like the mutant toys in Sid's bedroom (Sid and his dog Scud are the villains here, Sid being a rather twisted kid next door). The look of everything is astonishing, though it has aged in 20 years.This film is available on DVD/Blu-Ray is is well worth getting. Most highly recommended.","

But what makes it one of the best animated films of all time is its seamless blend of sophisticated storytelling with state-of-the-art animation.The screenplay is a gem in itself too for the plot is tightly knitted, makes excellent use of wit & is inhabited by a colourful set of characters who exhibit a stunning level of depth in their respective arcs. Its make-believe world is extremely convincing, the references n homages it makes to earlier classics is tastefully carried out, the relationship between kids & their toys is nailed to perfection and it also manages to convey its themes with effortless finesse.Adding more heart n soul to its characters are the talented voices behind it spearheaded by Tom Hanks & Tim Allen who infuse life into Woody & Buzz Lightyear respectively plus their on-screen chemistry is absolutely fantastic. Cinematography is expertly carried out, pacing is very brisk for the film never loses momentum & keeps getting better as plot progresses while Randy Newman's music instills an immense feeling of joy, warmth & wonder with its adventurous tracks.And then of course there is the revolutionary 3D animation that marked the dawn of a new era in animation which soon went on to completely re-invent its medium. It may not look as spellbinding today as it did back in 1995 but its influence on film, technology, video games & even computer graphics ever since cannot be understated, nor can be denied the role it played in the rise of new animation studios which ultimately put its medium in the same league that other genres have enjoyed since long.On an overall scale, Toy Story is a magical blend of kinetic direction, smart screenplay, rich characters, ideal voice cast, dynamic camera-work, terrific editing & heartwarming score that's freshly envisioned, ingeniously composed & gorgeously animated. A masterwork of jaw-dropping quality refined to perfection that triumphs in all aspects, Toy Story marks a significant moment in cinema for it marks the arrival of what would later become arguably the most acclaimed as well as critically & commercially excelling film studio of our time.","

"TOY STORY","Robert_duder","4 July 2010","I think it is a pretty common conception that Toy Story revolutionized animation. Pixar's first release jump started the animation craze that has lasted nearly two decades and still going strong and gave birth to some of the biggest films of the last 15 years. So it should have been an easy choice for my 900th review with Toy Story craze back on with the new and equally as amazing third installment. Toy Story brings to life some of the greatest characters in film history. You will fall in love with all the characters within the first 15 minutes and makes every step of their fantastical adventure even more captivating. The adventure they go on when you look at it from a truth standpoint is no more than 'down the street' and back but when you're a 3-6 inch toy that changes everything and that is truly the brilliance of Toy Story. You will become one of these toys, their world is so real to you and you see everything from their perspective. Every single person on the planet had toys of one kind of another whether it be a stuffed teddy or a stick and watching Toy Story will make you fondly remember your childhood and look at every inanimate object we love in a different light.Tom Hanks is Woody. No one could ever take that away from him as is the case with many of the toys. Hanks is the soul of the good hearted, compassionate and brave toy cowboy. His voice is so incredibly animated and excited and just absolutely perfect. Tim Allen is as good as Hanks playing the role of everyone's favourite space toy Buzz Lightyear. The chemistry the film makers create between Buzz and Woody is phenomenal and probably one of the biggest reasons Toy Story remains so successful. If I could spend time on each and every voice actor in this film I would because this is without a doubt thee BEST voice acting cast in animation history. Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn (my personal favourite Rex), John Ratzenberger (simply amazing), and to a lesser extent but still amazing Annie Potts, John Morris (who was Andy in all three films spanning 15 years), Laurie Metcalf and the incredibly versatile character actor R. Lee Ermey. This entire cast created animation history. You will not find a better cast and considering they are all behind the scenes voicing fictional characters that is impressive.Director John Lasseter is not new to animation although Toy Story will certainly be considered his piece de resistance for certain. He has worked in various capacity on dozens of amazing Disney features but he obviously knows his characters, he obviously knows Disney and he obviously is in touch with the little child inside himself and all of us. Best of all Toy Story holds no punches. I would even hesitate to allow my young, young children to see the film before they were ready because there is truly some terrifying scenes in the film and some really creepy characters. Sid and his torturing of toys, and his rag tag band of creepy toy outcasts are downright creepy and make the story even more incredibly but could certainly creep out little children but the happy ending and the bright world of Andy's room and knowing that the Toys will win in the end brings everything together. If you hate cartoons, if you have never seen Toy Story you are short changing yourself because this film will make you realize animation is not your grand daddy's cartoons anymore. A brilliant amazing film that is probably one of the best ever made. 10/10 THANKS FOR STICKING WITH ME THROUGH 900 REVIEWS AND ON TO 1000!! 901 and 902 WILL BE TOY STORY 2 AND 3 RESPECTIVELY. Read on!!","

"TOY STORY","lisafordeay","28 December 2015","In 1995 a man named John Lasseter set up his own company called Pixar which was also owned by the late Steve Jobs. So their first film was of course Toy Story. Everyone has seen this movie before its probably the best Pixar movie to date since the mid 1990s. The story is about Woody the cowboy(voiced by Tom Hanks)who is a toy along with many other toys that come to life when no one is in the room. All of the toys are owned by Andy a young boy who lives with his mom and his sister. So on the eve of Andy's birthday he ends up getting a new toy,the Buzz Lightyear toy which is a very popular toy who is a space ranger. So when Woody is introduced to Buzz Lightyear(voiced by Tim Allen)Woody ends up being jealous of him and he would do anything to be the center of attention again. But when a rough kid who lives next door accidentally gets Woody and Buzz out of a cash rending machine its up to Woody and Buzz to escape Sid's house.Overall this was a very original authentic masterpiece. The story is very good,the music is great,the charcthers are engaging and the whole set up is fantastic. Its a shame it didn't win an Oscar but at least the 2010 prequel to it won Best Animated Feature beating the likes of Tangled and How To Train Your Dragon. 9/10","

"TOY STORY","g-bodyl","4 February 2011","Toy Story is hands down the best animated film of all times. It's also a groundbreaking film with computer animation and it allowed more movie producers to explore the art. Fortunately that did happen because nowadays animated movies are staples in movie making.This is about a toy cowboy named Woody who is the favorite toy of his owner, Andy. He gets jealous when Andy gets a new toy, Buzz Lightyear. It only gets worse when both of them are missing and get stuck in evil Sid's room.The voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are probably the best well-known voices in animated films.The music by Randy Newman is fantastic. The songs and score alike are fantastic and memorable.Overall, this is the best animated film of all times and it spawned two very good sequels. I rate this film 10/10.","

"TOY STORY","lesleyharris30","15 July 2010","Toy Story is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding voice cast. It is complete harmless fun from start to finish, as we follow a group of toys that come to life when the owners are not around. All the characters are very well established, Woody is very layered with great depth and there is great development put in to Buzz Lightyear over the course of the film.The humour in the film is terrific, a great balance between what children and what adults will find funny. It is clear that Pixar tried very hard to ensure this would be a movie that the entire family, people of all ages, can watch and enjoy.The cast is phenomenal, Tom Hanks shines as Woody and truly embodies the emotions the character is undergoing. Tim Allen is also terrific as Buzz Lightyear and conveys the characters realisation of his reality brilliantly throughout, other highlights for me would be Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head and John Ratzenberger as Hamm. It is a feel good movie and you will find it hard not to wipe the smile off your face from start to finish. Funny, sweet and well animated, Toy Story is fun for the whole family. When Andy gets a new toy for his birthday, his favorite toy, Woody, grows jealous as he feels he's getting replaced.","

While the animation quality is quite dated, it is used effectively to portray the shiny toys. The story is the real stand-out feature here. It starts with Woody the Cowboy, Andy's favourite toy, threatened by the arrival of Buzz Lightyear. Woody's attempts to get rid of Buzz spiral out of hand and things get quite emotional and dramatic.","

"TOY STORY","The-Sarkologist","17 March 2021","I guess it was time to watch another film that I had seen quite a while ago and hadn't really been all that interested in of late. I guess the reason is that I generally don't like animated features all that much, but I had a choice to make, and I decided that I'd choose this film. Well, I'm sort of glad that I did. Okay, it is your basic Disney film so you can pretty much get an idea of what it is about. It is also apparently one of the first entirely computer animated films that was produced, so it was breaking ground back in the day (though these days it is pretty common place).I'm sure we all know the story though - it is about the relationship between Woody, the cowboy toy who was Andy's favourite toy, and that is until he received Buzz Lightyear for a birthday present, and suddenly Woody discovers that he has become a has been. In fact, Woody's pride of place on the bed is suddenly replaced by Buzz Lightyear. Anyway, both of them end up getting lost, and they have to make their way back to Andy before they move off across the country (and of course Woody is blamed for Buzz Lightyear becoming lost).While this is a kids film, there is a lot that can resonate to us as adults, and that is the fear of becoming obsolete. Sure, the film does have a happy ending, but the thing is that many of us adults live with that fear of one day becoming obsolete, and it doesn't matter how wealthy you are because, well, something could happen and you suddenly discover that you are no longer relevant - just ask Blockbuster Video.In a way we spend our entire lives trying to remain relevant only to discover that there is little we can do to maintain that. This is a fear that all of the toys experience every birthday and Christmas, as they attempt to listen in to the present opening ceremony to find out if they will still be relevant afterwards. Unfortunately for Woody, who is the favourite toy, this position is a position that is very precarious, as I suspect that there are a lot of toys in the box that were once in that position, and have suddenly found themselves being replaced.The problem with these happy ending films is that it suggests that things will eventually work out, but remaining relevant is a life long effort, and requires you to make some serious decisions down the track. Unfortunately there are no hard and fast answers to this problem, and the movie doesn't provide one either, however it does make us think, and those of us who believe that we are indispensable need to re-evaluate that position.","

"TOY STORY","Jasper76","17 September 2008","Imagine a world where whenever your back is turned or whenever you leave a room your toys come to life and communicate with each other like we do. Woody is the toy cowboy doll of a boy called Andy. Woody is Andys favorite toy until one day Andys birthday comes around and he gets a new toy which quickly becomes Andys favourite toy ahead of Woody. Woody quickly becomes jealous because not only has Andy pushed him aside but his fellow toy friends have chosen the new toy Buzz Lightyear ahead of Woody so now Woody plots a way to get Buzz out of the way for good with disastrous consequences. I will say no more about the movie as i feel if you haven't seen it then most of this film should be a surprise to you. All i do have to say however is Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz are superb choices as the voices of the main characters. This is an incredibly warm hearted and fun family film that a child of any age would love.","

"TOY STORY","sol-","17 February 2017","In a world in which toys talk and move whenever humans are not looking, a cowboy doll experiences jealousy for the very first time after an action figure replaces him as his owner's favourite toy in this popular animated comedy. The premise lends itself to a number of perplexing unanswered questions (in particular, regarding the 'rules' that the toys follow to freeze as soon as there is the possibility of a human seeing them move) but if one accepts the basic notion and runs with it, the film offers a surprisingly compelling story with striking personal identity themes as both of the main toys come to realise that they are not as special as they once thought. For Woody, it comes with realising that his owner can have other favourite toys and for Buzz it comes from awakening to the fact that he actually is a toy and not the famous space commander that he is designed as being. The film is blessed by excellent animation effects too; while many entirely computer generated animated films have come out in the years since, few have used the process quite so delightfully with lots of mobile tracking and panning shots that would have been near impossible to get right in a live action feature. The changing facial reactions on the toys (especially Woody) are impressive too - even if the fact that the toys in the film look more realistic than the humans in the film never quite feels right. This is, of course, a film about the toys though, and fanciful as the premise may well be, there is a lot to like about their loyalty both towards their owners and each other.","

So whilst this isn't necessarily a 10, it is not far off)Enter the first film of the established and ageless Pixar studio, who has produced numerous award winning films that are a joy for all ages.This one establishes the formula well, providing lots of world building and exploring a world in which toys are alive and live a secret life. It is absolutely extremely clever to say the least, and the well-rounded cast only elevates it.The animation is top notch, and though it would be improved later on obviously, it's still incredibly sharp.The script is brilliant, showcasing lots of incredibly well written drama and comedy. It plays in many ways like a road trip film, and it does so to brilliance.Overall, an incredible film that is absolutely very much deserving of all its awards, and a thrill for all ages.It works splendidly as a standalone, but would also be the starting point of a trilogy, a legacy sequel, and of course the entire Pixar legacy.","

The premise is bullet-proof with the Toy Story films based on the simple childhood fantasy That will exist for as long as children have played with toys and it will persist for as long as they continue to do so.I always have a special connections with Toy Story as it brings nostalgia from my childhood but not just that its characters are iconic with magic voice overs from Tom Hank and Tim Allen plus the other cast just enriches the film foundation to build on with an engaging witty script suitable for all ages which many films have failed in the past.Finally the spin-off films like Hawaiian Vacation, Partysaurus Rex and Toy Story of Terror! are a wonderful addition to the franchise with just as good as quality then most full length films out there today.","

The most remarkable thing however is how they managed to shape a whole world full of toys and other playthings and made us care for them, that alone speaks volumes!","

"TOY STORY","johnnyboyz","16 July 2010","Amongst a lot of other things, 1995's Toy Story is a mixing of basic filmic conventions in the form of character arcs and genre demands blended with highly effective comedic content, all combined with a high concept into a piece thoroughly enjoyable and worthwhile. Its energy unmistakable; its inspiration unequalled and its charm unmatched, in what is a milestone in animation for reasons much more than the fact the computer generated imagery was as fresh as it was. Vaugely, the memory of seeing it for the first time many years ago stands in rather stark comparison to whatever I recall of the rest of that viewing when it was revealed Toy Story was to be, quite literally, about the toys and their coming to life so as to interact and engage with their surroundings. In starting in the manner it does, with a young boy named Andy animating his toys to as to bring them to life and interact with what's around them as it ran on whatever meek story he could come up with and not knowing a thing about the premise or indeed content, ignorantly, I led myself into believing the entire piece would be of this ilk; quite literally, a toy story about toys being what they are: inanimate objects being interacted with by a child. Imagine the sense of surprise mixed with awe and glee when Woody sits up in Andy's room and announces that ""the coast is clear!"" to the rest of the toys.The film starts like one of those short cartoons you'd see before the beginning of a feature film, years ago. The opening is a diverting mini-narrative involving each of the main characters going through whatever motions a child can muster; the lead toy of whom is Woody (Hanks), a cowboy doll which is promptly taken downstairs and around the house as it's emphasised he is Andy's favourite, and has been for a while. I suppose what happens when they come alive might be read into as a deconstruction of these toys; that they are, indeed, so much more than just inanimate objects whom don't think nor feel, each of them coming alive once the humans have vacated then operating within said space; maintaining relationships and feeling an array of emotions such as fear, angst and lust. Some are friendlier than others; some more confident and some have certain elevated relationships with each other. Amongst them, Don Rickles' Potato Head doll; a wonderful creation of physical comedy whose detachable body parts are the source of persistently funny jokes. He's joined by a Slinky Dog (Varney); a green plastic dinosaur Rex (Shawn) and, curiously, Andy's piggy bank Hamm (Ratzenberger).Interestingly, Andy's toys seem infused by true-to-life western iconographic imagery, or are indeed representative of 'type' in their attitudes. Rex is a dinosaur, thus feels the need to be able to scare people with his 'roar' for reasons that must be linked to the fact T-Rex dinosaurs from billions of years ago did exactly this. Somehow, Rex is aware of this. Likewise Andy's small toy soldiers, led by a sergeant voiced by R. Lee Ermey, are as militarian as you'd expect but is there a written rule that says they must show expertise in special ops and must behave in the military manner they do? Remember those grey plastic soldiers of similar size you could get? I guess they'd be equally militarily efficient but could speak in a German accent. I had some yellow soldiers of similar size once; God only knows how they'd sound. There can be no surprise that the toys of Syd (von Detten) cannot speak, due to their forced hybridising with other toys under said child's tortuous regime which sees heads and bodies swapped with other toys thus falsifying their image.It can be no coincidence the two principal toy characters of the film are the two that most resemble human beings in their appearance, with Andy's other toys marginalised due to their animistic or unnatural characteristics. Woody's perfect existence is thrown into disarray by Buzz Lightyear (Allen), a spaceman toy Andy gets on his birthday; the revealing of the gift at the end of the present opening session starting this huge build up as to what Buzz is. Buzz's presence is an example of an item of a more futuristic; more science-fiction orientated nature coming into the house and taking over as older items are rendered more obsolete and therefore replaced thus rendering the issue one of a modernity driven nature, and is an item Toy Story 2 explored much more broadly in terms of genre replacing genre when toys of Woody's ilk are rendered nothing but mere museum pieces. But it is additionally representative of America's obsession with consumerism, in that I've no doubt Buzz is a part of a kind of franchise and Andy's gradual replacing of Woody posters/merchandise etc. This, as he and his mother occupy this blissfully suburban infused street which is systematic of the nation's own attitudes towards mass produced products.Woody and Buzz's overall ultimatum is issued to us, out loud, by Woody when they are stranded at a petrol station: Andy's due to move house shortly and both need to get home, so a lot is at stake and tension runs persistently high. Buzz's own tale of realisation is effortlessly inter-cut with this plight, along the way learning of a new existence and garnering a new lease of life as their relationship feeds off a rather Hollywoodised 'buddy' combination no doubt inspired by American films of the 1980s through to the early 1990s of this ilk. Apart from pioneering your now token 'chase' finale, of which encompasses all the elements and is seen nearer the end of mostly every CG animated film made since (see 2002's Monsters Inc. or 2009's Up), Toy Story is a wonderfully made, supremely nourishing film that opens our eyes to a whole new world within our own and enthrals and entertains in equal measure.","

Choosing toys as the subject for their first full-length feature was genius, as the plastic look fits the subject. The voice performances are perfect, the screenplay is stellar, the pacing is brisk, & it boasts one of my personal favorite comedic scenes of dialogue in movie history (argument under a semi at the gas station.""YOU!

"TOY STORY","Movie_Muse_Reviews","15 November 2018","""Toy Story"" came out when I was in third grade and it remains the most revolutionary film of my lifetime. Outside of Pixar's offices, who would've predicted that in 1995, at the at the height of Disney's 2D animated musical resurgence, that the course of animated family films had just been changed forever.And it wasn't just the technology. ""Toy Story"" undoubtedly deserves to be heralded until the end of time for being the first computer-animated feature film, but so many other forces contributed to it becoming the year's box-office champion, chief among them - story.Pixar's first concept exemplifies all the incredible storytelling they've done in the last 20-plus years: What do our toys do when no one is watching? Children's imaginations have infused their toys with life ever since there were toys, and ""Toy Story"" plays out that fantasy for kids while evoking profound nostalgia for the parents.This ""hidden world"" notion, with stories that explore little universes hiding in plain sight, has been Pixar's secret story sauce. Just take a look at the movie's credits to see how that concept influenced future classics: Pixar father (and the film's director) John Lasseter (""A Bug's Life,"" ""Cars""), Pete Docter (""Monsters Inc.,"" ""Up,"" ""Inside Out"") and Andrew Stanton (""Finding Nemo,"" ""WALL-E"").But even a brilliant concept needs anchoring in real, universal human themes, and that's the real reason Pixar has been the cream of the crop ever since November 22, 1995. In ""Toy Story,"" that boils down to the characters of Woody and Buzz. There's Woody, who has the whole being a toy thing figured out and enjoys his cozy little ""spot"" as Andy's favorite. Then there's Buzz Lightyear, the shiny new novelty who hasn't had the existential realization that he's not a space ranger yet. It's a storyline for these two leads born out of something that happens all the time: kids' tastes change and they're always moving on to the next cool toy. Woody's jealousy and Buzz's naivete are relatable to kids and adults alike.That takes us to the crowning touch on ""Toy Story"" - the voice acting (no, not Randy Newman, but he's crucial to the film's complete aesthetic). Only with the casting of Robin Williams as the Genie in ""Aladdin"" a couple years earlier had there even existed the notion of casting big-name actors in animated films. Even then, like Williams, the name parts were given to comedians in the comic relief roles. Getting Tom Hanks to play the lead role was a total coup, and when ""Toy Story"" made bank, animation studios immediately began putting together cast lists of name actors that could barely fit on a movie poster.Hanks' Woody still deserves to rank as one of the best voice-acting performances. He's the emotional signpost keeping young viewers in tune with how they should feel at each moment (though Buzz's botched flight attempt is the emotional apex of the movie to be sure). Hanks isn't merely lending his voice to the film, he's playing the role of Woody, and it makes all the difference.During my many childhood viewings, ""Toy Story"" always felt like an exhaustive multi-chapter journey, especially once Woody and Buzz leave the confines of Andy's room, so on this revisit it's funny to realize that the film remains Pixar's shortest. That's how much dimension Lasseter and team pack into this movie and a large part of why it endures. Any notion that ""Toy Story"" was a ""cute"" first attempt by a studio that would go on to vastly improve upon it is missing the point. Yes, Pixar would get more visually advanced, build even more intricate worlds and tell even more emotionally deeper stories (and all in the ""Toy Story"" series alone), but all those elements in this film still stand strong on their own. It's a classic, and one that set the bar upon which all those films were left with no choice but to strive for.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more","

"TOY STORY","BooChanan","27 August 2012","Toy Story was PIXAR's first full-length movie and is still today regarded as one of their best along with the two sequels. The movie is about toys coming to life when the children aren't around. The movie shows how every toy wants to be loved. The main character, Woody (a cowboy), is the most loved toy in Andy's house until another toy, Buzz Light (space ranger), is bought. The story is about their jealousy and friendship; which is portrayed brilliantly in the plot which is aided by an amazing Randy Newman soundtrack. The movie is clever, funny, sad and beautiful in the way that it engrosses all age groups. It was a milestone in animation with its stunning 3-D graphics. I strongly recommend this movie to anybody who hasn't seen it. It is one of PIXAR's and Disney's greatest movies ever and is very worthy of a 10 out of 10.","

Launched in 1995, this production became, for example, the first fully animated by computer.Rather than trying to amaze your audience with just its innovative look - for the time - ""Toy Story"" focuses on winning the audience over its characters. Let us start with its protagonists. Despite looking like just another good-natured character at first, Woody becomes increasingly complex as the film goes on, feeling not only jealous of Buzz, but also with a real fear of being left out by the one he saw as his most loyal companion. A scene that marks in a very simple but effective way, this affection is immediately in the opening credits, when Woody ""falls"" beside Andy on the sofa. In this first film, Woody is a character with a rather complicated bow, who could easily transform the wooden cowboy into a figure that children would be disgusted by because of their attitudes. Thanks to the sensitivity of the filmmakers, we understand his actions and accompany his emotional growth.Buzz, on the other hand, suffers from a problem that prevents him from determining within his reality. Believing himself to be a space hero, his naiveté and innocence in his belief manage to maximize the anger that Woody feels when he sees the astronaut so casually stealing an affection that he so cherished. Like Woody, Buzz ""loses"" something in the course of the film, a loss perhaps deeper than that of the sheriff. There is still a historical element in the relationship of the two, after all it is a fact that in the American children's imagination, there was really a replacement of cowboys by astronauts, during the space race.The supporting actors also steal the show, all with very striking personalities and visuals. The acid Mr. Potato Head is the highlight of this troupe, simply priceless, always with a sarcastic comment at the tip of his non-existent language. The neurotic dinosaur Rex also gets a good laugh. The Slinky spring dog and Pig work very well as ""stairs"", with their interaction together being excellent, while Sergeant and his soldiers play a small, but anthological, action scene. It is also impossible not to mention the disfigured toys in Sid's room, which have a great participation and a very interesting look. As a matter of fact, the little villain and his kind sister Hannah end up being the best-developed human characters in history, especially Sid. It is funny that the audience can barely get to know Andy, but that he gets so much into the crazy psyche of the young pyromaniac.The merits of the film directed by John Lasseter are many. In addition to being a beautiful work (debut of the partnership between Disney and Pixar), with a well-designed script, charismatic characters and adventure in the right measure, it opened doors to several other good productions. If it weren't for Woody and Buzz, we might not have seen (the way they got to our eyes, at least) Antz (1998), Shrek (2001), Finding Nemo (2003) and Ratatouille (2007), among so many others. In addition to the impressive look for the time, what draws the most attention in Toy Story is its plot. Creative and with deep characters, the animation has a story that manages to please children and still interest adults. In fact, this is a characteristic of the vast majority of animations in recent years. This concern with the non-child audience ended up raising the challenge for the screenwriters and turned the stories into a program for the whole family. The feature film directed by John Lasseter is one of the pioneers in this regard.It was essential, therefore, the feature film to be made on computers. Far from these machines being lifeless - as toys are not - there was, however, a lot of passion in the will of Pixar Animation Studios' artists to become pioneers. This is an achievement, consequently, that not only enhances Toy Story in a technical sense, already deserving of awards. On the other hand, the technological revolution in question also magnified animation in other terms: as in the realization of its creation of a world, in itself new, which would originate a sentimental approach between cinema and the public. The enchantment, in turn, does not lie only in the ""superficial"" novelty, because there is value in the content and in an integration between technology and narrative. In terms of deepening a sense of love for all the children who watched the animation, Toy Story fulfills, in this case, an instigating creative proposal - which, by the way, is very original, inviting. The script is concerned, moreover, with using the magical premise not only as a pretext, but as part of a study. It is important for Toy Story, therefore, to understand who these toys are and what their real goals are in the world.The script, moreover, wears patience by not exposing the premise face-to-face, building patiently the mystique and understanding of the dramas that are at stake and that serve a discursive purpose: a creation of a fictional world that resignifies real relationships. This whole ensemble enriches the imaginative sense and the affection of the spectator-children for their dolls and dolls, as well as investing the attention of the animators in a universe that has many layers of verisimilitude. It may even be that part of the target audience does not have many friendships in their daily lives, however, it certainly does in their rooms. Woody's (Tom Hanks) journey, in this case, basically covers his jealousy with the arrival of Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a toy astronaut who believes he is a real space explorer, but who gets to be played more often by Andy, the owner of both characters. The two are lost and need to return before the boy moves.In the midst of existentialist crises, the protagonists enter trajectories that progressively intensify the love that is at stake. Certain songs, in fact, complement the dramas of the characters. The soundtrack by Randy Newman, who introduced us to classics like ""You've Got a Friend in Me"". Music is crucial in establishing unconditional love between toys and owners. ""Strange Things"" and ""I Will Go Sailing No More"" are striking in this sense. Buzz, in his instance, is about to perceive himself as a fraud, until his mission takes on other meanings, no longer being to protect the galaxies, but to protect the heart of a mere boy. Woody, on the other hand, even without Andy playing with him, needs to be at his disposal when the boy needs it. This magical idea of love above all is very rewarding to the public, although open to some questioning, as it supports a little slave-like thinking. But even so, the argument manages to find a resolution, bringing the antagonist Sid (Erik von Detten) to oppose Andy as a child and, ultimately, to suffer the consequences of his behavior. The moralism builds an imaginary that is powerful enough to impact, without having to be expository or pedagogical. As a promise of an eternal friendship, Toy Story transposes cinematic walls to embrace us, talking to us personally.And like any game, the animation would need to be imaginative, it would need to entertain and also conquer. Of the most exciting adventures that animated cinema has ever presented, Toy Story is, above all, a good story. The necessary events occupy the short duration of the film very quickly, however, never seeming rushed or needing silly solutions to find conclusions. The confrontations that emerge in the course of the narrative sound natural, like Buzz ignoring Woody's calls to enter a spaceship and then be captured by Sid. There is a lot of intelligence in the way the script takes advantage of the dramas, like the enmity that Andy's other toys take from Woody, to rearrange specific scenes. Various possibilities of solutions are emerging for the characters, bringing them closer to their objectives, however, recurrently, a new problem appears to be a barrier to the anticipated success of the mission. When the cowboy is just a window away from his owner's room, for example, a twist in the plot of Buzz Lightyear prevents him from being rescued. The linked events, therefore, exemplify excellent precision in cohesion.The animation, taking into account that it is a film released in 1995, is quite fluid, especially in the action sequences. An absolute highlight in this regard is the climax of the film, with Woody and Buzz racing to reach Andy's moving truck.Certainly, the film does not have the emotional nuances that its sequences would present, but it is extremely rich in establishing the public's empathy with such characters, so that this future becomes a possibility. Each of the supporting actors - who would gain more presence in the narrative at other times - traces a particular personality. Each staff occupies a space in the imaginary. Iconographical, an animation is created that takes from the public's nostalgia with the toys of his past - or those of the present - to recreate his own. The premise is somewhat simple, however, the reinventions in the journey show a creative care that deservedly earned animation an Oscar nomination for Original Screenplay. A technological experiment, a cinematic revolution, an intimate achievement. Toy Story takes on several meanings over the years, however, in the end, the most important thing even lives in the connection that the work establishes with its audience.","

"TOY STORY","SofiaHedge","23 May 2020","The main reason for my 10/10 rating is because it accomplished something that was a big deal in the 90s'. It was the first computer animated feature length film EVER. This amusing movie was a great for it, because it really broke the boundaries at the time, and that's what makes an great, original movie. I like the storyline, the characters are interesting, the acting was decent, and just about everything else was amusing. It's very entertaining.","

"TOY STORY","Skeletors_Hood","23 January 2003","Yes people, I will dare to come out as the perhaps only person to truly hate this film.  While the animation is groundbreaking to say the least, it doesn't mean that it has a story to back it up.  I for one love cartoon movies, but this left a sour taste in  my mouth.  Maybe it's because in what is supposed to be a kids' movie, we see one character trying to ""off"" another character, out of pure jealousy.  The other toys were just annoying as the chorus, as they, like the leads, had a total lack of any real character.  There were some bad attempts at humor that didn't even win a giggle out of me or my family.Skip it and see Shrek or Ice Age.  Better stories to balance the animation.","

"TOY STORY","jfgibson73","25 May 2015","I enjoy watching this movie over and over. It is structured so carefully, I can pick up from any point and be immersed. I love reading about how it was made just as much as watching it, and collect books about Pixar and the making of these films. But as much as I enjoy the craft and history of Toy Story, I also think it deserves credit for its influence. It's just too bad that all the filmmakers that think they're working from the Toy Story template are missing the main ingredient: story. Pixar worked and reworked this script for years and refused to quit until they got it right. Woody and Buzz, Pizza Planet, Andy's Bedroom, Sid--I only wish I had appreciated it for what it was upon its release. But I get it now. And I will be there for whatever this company does next.","

I still love it five years after seeing it in the theatres.Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are well-cast as Woody and Buzz Lightyear respectively, and a stellar voice cast includes Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger, and Jim Varney. The story follows the plights of Woody, who becomes jealous of Buzz, who seemingly becomes their kid owner's new favorite toy. They wind up in the house of the evil kid next door and have to make their way back home.A great one!*** 1/2 out of ****","

"TOY STORY","questl-18592","28 September 2019","It's amazing how this movie has changed over the years. How the once amazing graphics have aged and really don't hold up is the obvious thing but there's more than that.When I was younger, Sid was just the monster next door but watching it now I can't help but notice how the movie is (inadvertently) commenting on the impact parents have on their children. Andy's mom always being there, loving and supporting while Sid is literally blowing things up and his dad just sleeps in his recliner in a tucked away room.Then there's Woody, the cowboy that made us all fall in love with Pixar. To see him now... Woody is a jerk. He's self involved, selfish and even violent all because he's no longer the favorite.But that is the brilliance of Pixar. 19 years later, the visuals may have waned but the story complexities have matured like a fine wine proving that they have always understood how to make movies for children and adults alike.","

"TOY STORY","Mysterygeneration","13 June 2022","The first computer-animated picture, ""Toy Story,"" achieves a liberating and new three-dimensional reality and freedom of movement. The film doesn't only animate actors against painted backdrops; it fully animates them and allows the viewer to freely navigate around them.It took 800,000 hours of computer time to create Toy Story. Each frame requires up to 300 megabytes of data.John Lasseter and his team bring Woody, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, and Bo Peep to life. When their owner is not present, the toys come to life. Woody sends all of the troops downstairs in a Bucket of Soldiers to keep an eye on what's going on. ""Toy Story"" lacks the plot ingenuity and wit of ""Rabbit"" or other Disney animated features like ""Beauty and the Beast."" Its greatest pleasures are just for the eyes, but what delights they are!","

"TOY STORY","charliejennifercheng","19 September 2014","Eventually Toy Story was everything of my childhood,from the imagination and the belief that the toys would come to life,to the tongue in cheek script that get me laughing a lot,the story that makes me think and value till today on how a great story can make a huge impact to people and the likable characters that I grew up loving and having these toys as those played in my childhood.Its animation,though it was made at that time when CGI animation was just starting,or they did started the whole thing was top notch till today when I watched it in Hi Def.As it was always,it was the everything that a great movie could offer. We started with a simple yet powerful plot about a toy cowboy doll who is on top of his game,admiration and respect from his fellow toys as well as the unconditional love he has from his owner,Andy.However this has changed,only for temporary when his owner brought in a new toy that he had just got as a birthday present,a space superhero action figure and due to his arrival ,the space superhero did got every thing of admiration and love that the cowboy once have that the cowboy was always sidelined from everything.This thus turned into an outrage of jealousy that the cowboy and the space superhero ended up getting into a conflict so severe that he got pushed out of the window so that his beloved owner would not find him,however it was lucky that the space superhero survived and thus another fight occurs this time in the petrol station.They then went onto a pizza delivery truck where their owner was there and ended up again being held captive by a cruel,yet troubled neighbor named Sid who just loves to torture toys every day.And together as they were held captive,they then have to come in terms to work together in order to save themselves from the captive they were in and also to get back to their owner who they then realized have love them unconditionally,Andy which is by far one of the most realistic plot I've ever come across,though it is viewed in a toy's perspective. The movie themes itself was also powerful itself.Though it is a kids movie,it deals with themes of jealousy,abduction,cruelty and suicide as well of positive themes of leadership,cooperation,love and friendship.It is a movie that plays well with every theme so well that it deserves to be praised to its highest point.It was a movie of all genre,from horror to action to comedy and to being inspirational at all claims which most movies did not have these days.Today,we do have the various types of CGI animated movies,from the ultra good (The Incredibles,How To Train Your Dragon,Monsters Inc) to the mediocre(Rise of The Guardians,Cars,Over The Hedge,Wreck It Ralph) the ultra bad( Frozen,Brave,Turbo,Antz,Chicken Little,Shark Tale ),but none can ever come to the touch of magic that Toy Story did left in many people's hearts.Also Toy Story is also the biggest reason to every animation student on why they wanted to study animation especially 3D at the first place.Without Toy Story we would not even think that taking a leap to animation would be really very possible for many aspiring animators and film directors of that line.Overall,Toy Story,which is honesty the first animated film that I grew up watching in my life(I was four a that time), was the first that I grew up loving everything from the movie.It it quite strange that it is only later that I've realized that this hugely influential movie was released at the same year that I was born,1995 which has then installed the love of animation towards me and my whole life.And it is when I've watched this movie is that I've decided on what I've wanted to do entirely ,directing an animated movie that is as groundbreaking as Toy Story. Overall,in my personal words,it is very tough to pen a review on a movie that you've loved so much in your life and has made a great impact on your career path.Personally ,Toy Story is an amazing film that was not over-hyped,but rather talked due to its legacy and greatness from everything it has,thus it should be remembered by many generations to come.Finally,I would like to thank John Lasseter,Ed Catmull and also whoever who has been involved in the production of this wonderful movie for opening the doors to many aspiring animators out there that anyone can live the legacy that Walt Disney did formerly","

It's outrageous, it's unfair! Certainly this is one of Pixar's greatest films, and thusly, given Pixar make the greatest animated masterpieces it should be scoring far higher, there are no issues with this film. The voice acting is on point, the plot is solid, for the time it was the most innovative film in a very very long time, and began an era of animation that continues to this very day, over a quarter of a century later.

"TOY STORY","Spondonman","28 December 2010","I've finally watched the 3 (so far) excellent Toy Story Pixar Disney films after hearing Mark Kermode recommend them on UK BBC as the BEST trilogy ever made, including the Godfathers. Well, who am I to argue with such a cinema expert? But he obviously doesn't remember the dashing Dick Barton!#1 has the main toy characters of Woody and Buzz overcoming impossible odds to escape from the clutches of psychotic child toy killer Sid, #2 Woody from the clutches of psychotic toy collector Al, #3 Buzz and the gang from the clutches of psychotic toy Lotso. Throughout the individual films and the series as a continuous whole the characters, the character development, the cgi cartoonery, the comedy and the story are uniformly elegant and almost perfect. This is fast paced logically progressed stuff for kids to enjoy and adults to appreciate, and hopefully most of the relational morals will be taken on board by most people – apart from whether or not it's OK for someone to be portrayed as owning apparently live human beings and using them as toys of course! Do you empathise more with Andy the caring Owner or Woody the faithful Slave, or neither like me?A personal yardstick I use for cartoons is Does the film look like the people who made the film had fun making it? With Toy Story 123 the answer is a resounding Yes – they were so full of fun and confident that even a cod Spanish reprise of Randy Newman's main song was included in 3. And that came after some surprising scenes of heartbreaking poignancy – containing Tom Hanks' finest ever performance. In an ever more populated genre getting ever more technologically advanced and intelligent this series remains magically simple, and simply the best of its kind. Great fun and very re-watchable.","

The music in the film is great and fits very well whatever see going on in the different scenes. The whole idea of the toys having to keep their lives a secret from the humans was very clever too. The film is just a brilliant tale of jealousy, lost identity and friendship, huge themes for a kids film but it's all pulled off with such skill. A brilliant movie.","

"TOY STORY","Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","18 January 2020","Toy Story became one of 1995's surprise hits after a troubled production that saw Woody's character go through a complete overhaul: he went from being a controlling jerk (there's a Black Friday Reel on YouTube that shows what could have been) to a wise leader who watches out for his friends and only gets shaken up when a new toy, Buzz Lightyear, is changing his world that shakes his place and stability amongst Andy's collection of toys. It's a simple story of protagonist-confronted-by-inciting-incident 'stuff' but this simplicity and true-to-their-heart cast of characters makes Toy Story such a great film that takes full advantage of its creative and multi-layered world.It's one of the world's defining animated movies thanks to its full-circle screenplay and top-notch character development never being squandered during the film's (admittedly) short runtime of 81 minutes. That doesn't even matter anyway: Toy Story is one of those landmark movies people will never get tired or revisiting over the years. It's just a pure joy to watch and rewatch.Toy Story gets 5/5 stars.","

"TOY STORY","Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","29 November 2018","Having recently viewed the Toy Story 4 teaser on YouTube, I felt the need to revisit these movies. I can honestly say that Toy Story is as important to animated cinema as Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in that both movies were the first feature length animated productions ever done in their respective mediums: Toy Story being the first computer-animated feature and Snow White being the world's first traditionally-animated feature.Toy Story is as synonymous with cinema as the works of Francis Ford Coppola, Stanley Kubrick, Hayao Miyazaki and Chuck Jones: it's a film that shows the best of every world in the imagination. There are toys that embody cowboys, spacemen, wrestlers, dogs, potatoes and figures that resemble the uber-edginess the mid-90s garnered thanks to hit video games like Doom and Mortal Kombat. Toy Story is a film that knows exactly what makes kids movies resonate with adults: having an emotional bridge that's built into the story itself where playtime and wisdom, as the fundamental themes to the film, is symbolic of the concept of people growing up and how that can change the world around you. You can still mature in ways that still keep you young and hopeful at heart even when everything around you is totally unpredictable and volatile.This film is a zeitgeist movie for the 90s and it's still technically very impressive to this very day. I'm struggling to find faults with this movie: it's one of those special movies that you can watch repeatedly and still find something new every time you watch it again.Toy Story is a 5/5 star masterpiece.","

"TOY STORY","Tornado_Sam","26 June 2019","While in general I tend to go for the classic animation style as opposed to all the fancy CGI stuff that goes on nowadays, you have to admit: These Disney-Pixar features are really quite entertaining. While this 3-d animation style has been overused a lot over the past decade, the films are admittedly fun, creative, and suspenseful; they are movies for all ages; and they are, furthermore, among the best and most harmless children's classics to be found today (set aside the upcoming ""Frozen II"").""Toy Story"" was, from what I gather, Pixar's first film and also the world's first CGI feature length movie. It plays upon an old, used but still timeless concept: that of toys and inanimate objects coming to life whilst the owners are away. In ""Toy Story"", the main characters are toy cowboy named Woody and toy space ranger Buzz Lightyear. (Call me crazy, but I am not familiar with either and still enjoyed it; you do not need to understand whom the toys are based upon to like it). Woody is the leader of all the toys in Andy's room, where they are played with every day. In their spare time, they come to life to have their own fun, and Woody (being the favorite) enjoys being in charge. Until Buzz shows up on Andy's birthday, and becomes the new favorite with all his fancy gear, 'lasers' and such. The two are soon in competition, which results in both ending up outside their house where a dangerous and ridiculously crazy adventure awaits.That being the basic synopsis, you can tell that in terms of storyline the movie is very simplistic. Yet it doesn't need a complex and overblown plot to be fun (although the ridiculously absurd ending is admittedly overdone) and in terms of intrigue and comedy it does a pretty good job. The characters are easy to sympathize with (how many of us have felt rejected over someone else?) and the parts are well-played. Woody and Buzz both work quite well in character--even if Woody is a completely self-centered jerk--and the minor parts are also nicely done. (As pointed out by other reviewers, the supporting cast of toys mostly deliver the comedy, although Woody's ""Mr. Light-Beer"" is a definite winner). For the most part, it is entirely child-friendly, although I can imagine that many kids would be a little frightened by Sid--who is more like Satan-as-a-mad-doctor in human form than a neighborhood kid. (Also, what kind of parents lets their kid play with fireworks?). As I said before, the crazy ending is as overblown as it gets, but that's part of what makes it memorable.In general, a fun film for families or otherwise, and definitely a classic when it comes to CGI animation. Only about an hour and a half and it does not pad itself out and stays within the appropriate run-time bounds. A nice update on the 'living toys' motif.","

"TOY STORY","brando647","10 August 2010","Pixar's long line of success began in 1993 with TOY STORY, the first in a series of highly successful CG family films. Pixar had the formula nailed from the start, creating a fun kid's film with a powerful story capable of entertaining adults. In the film, we're introduced to the world of Andy's room when no one's around and the toys come to life. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is a classic cowboy doll complete with a pull-string vocal box and reigns as young Andy's favorite toy. For his birthday, Andy receives a flashy new Buzz Lightyear action figure (voiced by Tim Allen) and Woody must cope with the fact that he may have been bumped from the top position. A botched attempt at lodging Buzz behind Andy's desk throws Buzz out into the real world and Woody must bring him back to regain the trust of the other toys.The fun of this kid's film lies in the characters. Allen is hilarious as Buzz and his inability to grasp that he's merely a child's toy and not an actual space ranger, spending half the film trying to return to Star Command; Hanks is a bit neurotic and totally high strung as Woody in his role as the toy-in-charge (going so far as to hold meetings on plastic erosion and establishing a buddy-system for moving day). The room is loaded with great supporting characters in the form of classic playthings from everyone's childhoods: a Slinky dog, a Mr. Potato Head, a piggy bankeach with their own unique personalities. These characters are each fun enough to deserve their own movie and we're lucky to have been given the TOY STORY sequels to return to this world.I really enjoy the film overall (as do just about everyone I know who's seen it) and there is little to complain about. It's amazing to see how well the animation stands up after so many years. You can see that the computer graphics aren't as smooth as modern CG, but it's still near seamless. Pixar's first film is a classic I was happy to introduce to my daughter.","

"TOY STORY","Pumpkin_Man","17 June 2010","I was 5 years old when this movie was released, and I've loved it ever since. It has a great storyline. Sheriff Woody is the leader of Andy's toys, such as Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Bo Peep, Slinky Dog, Rex, and many more. On Andy's Birthday, he receives a Buzz Lightyear action hero, and Woody becomes jealous because he isn't Andy's favorite anymore. When Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out of the window, his friends want nothing to do with him. On the way to Pizza Planet, Buzz confronts him in the family van, and knocks him outside and the family drive off without them. They go through a lot trying to get back to Andy before they move. When they end up in Sid's room, the kid who tortures toys, Woody and Buzz must work together in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TOY STORY!!!","

"TOY STORY","joe_roberts2000","13 October 2014","1995's Toy Story is a work of pure imagination. It covers topics of fantasy, friendship and jealousy. It also contains relatable characters which shines out compared to other animated films. The actors were perfectly cast (Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz - the list goes on...) and the intricate plot can be compared to some of the best movies ever. I think everyone in the world has seen Toy Story, but if you haven't, it's a must see. Its by far superior to its two sequels, but they are decent. Not only is it a great film, it is historically significant, as it was the first fully 3D animated film. You HAVE TO SEE THIS... J","

"TOY STORY","bosox4512","14 October 2006","This was the first feature film that was done entirely by computers, and Pixar couldn't have done a better job. Not only is this movie hilarious, touching, and well plotted, but it lead the way for every other computer animated movie, and really set the bar high. If this movie had completely bombed there would no more, or at least not as many, CGI films and we would still be seeing drawn animation. Not to mention that the absolute perfect voice talents were cast to make such a memorable movie for kids and adults and teens and preteens and seniors and new borns or anybody else who eyes and hears or either or. This movie can not me avoided and is a cultural landmark that has opened the door for a completely new genre of movie making.","

"TOY STORY","Benjamin-M-Weilert","7 March 2023","One benefit of having children is revisiting movies from my youth. I saw Toy Story (1995) in theaters and was immediately struck by how amazing it was that they made the entire film with computers. While this is no longer something that causes awe, there is something about the first movie to make this leap. Almost 30 years later, Toy Story shows its age in some of its visual aspects. However, the cinematography and storytelling here are top-notch and often made me ignore the CGI which is comparatively less polished than today's effects.To Pixar's credit, they did the best they could by focusing on slightly easier-to-animate characters than humans or animals. The people and pets in Toy Story look horrific (sometimes on purpose) but there has to be grace for the limitations of the time. Still, with the immense flexibility of the digital camera, some shots in Toy Story that would have been impossible in a live-action context are played for maximum effect here to make the world of toys seem absolutely massive. Underlying all of this is some fantastic cinematography that does not skimp on the fundamentals of visual storytelling.While Toy Story is not the first movie geared toward kids to appeal occasionally to adult humor (look no further than Genie's references in Aladdin (1992)), I still laughed at new visual gags decades later that I finally understood as an adult. There's a wide range of emotions that I still feel watching this film. From the unease of Sid's bedroom to the soaring victory of Woody (Tom Hanks) and Buzz (Tim Allen) arriving back in Andy's care, this film hits a lot of emotional beats despite its ""kid movie"" status. Is it a perfect movie? Not quite, but it certainly pushed the door wide open for CGI-animated films for decades to come.An impressive (for its time) visual treat with surprisingly strong fundamentals, I give Toy Story 4.5 stars out of 5.","

The first real mainsteam adult-friendly computer animated film. Actually the first real computer-animated film. Toy Story took a cutesy premise and made it believable with a very good storyline, excellent voice acting and amazing design, especially for the time even though this holds up exceptionally well now. More important than this is the longevity of the characters, you can have the prettiest backdrop and brightest colours going but if a kid doesn't like the characters in the thing it isn't going far. Go to a birthday party for any kid under 10 and you'll likely see a Buzz Lightyear or Woody the cowboy. More important this film can be watched and rewatched by anyone from 3 to 43 and there will be something to enjoy, again and again. As a side-note: My videoshop password was Woody for about 5 years thanks to this movie. What you hope kids will learn: Be good to your toys. What they'll take away: Space toys are cool. And Cowboy toys are cool. And Dog toys are cool. And I need one of those Dinosaur toys. Oh, oh, oh and a Mr Potato Head... And a Piggy!

"TOY STORY","Sirus_the_Virus","28 November 2009","Toy story is the first Pixar animated film. Toy story amazed everyone on earth back in 1995 and still does to this day. That amazes us and so does Pixar. Bringing us some of the best films of our time. Nowadays we have Up, Ratatouille, Wall E, Finding Nemo. The list goes on. But we should remember the first one.Toy story stars Tim Allen and Tom Hanks as Toys. Hanks plays Woody, a cowboy toy who is the most popular from his owner Andy. That all changes when Andy buys a toy called Buzz Lightyear(Tim Allen) who is an astronaut. Woody becomes awfully jealous and tries everything in his power to get rid of Buzz.There are other plot points that I would rather not go into. Toy story creeps me out a little. The thing about it that creeps me out is the villain named Sid. Sid is this toy murderer who lives next door to Andy and the toy gang. There is a part in the end when all of the toys retaliate. That part scares me every time. Watching these destroyed toys retaliate. I never thought something like that could creep me out. I guess I get creeped too easily. The first Toy story is a work of art. It's got great visuals and will creep you out. Kind of like Robert Zemeckis' A Christmas carol, which is another work of art I think. As I have said in many reviews, Toy story is a film that you'll never forget. I haven't. My memory is crap.Toy story:****/****","

From here, you have all the Shrek, etc. derivatives.Not only is the film irresistibly funny it is also has a clever story and unlike many movies of today you can watch this one over and over. The voices are done by a host of popular names that we all know and love. Some of the most popular being Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, and John Ratzenberger as Hamm. Jim Varney even lends his hilarious voice as Slinky the Dog. The story is about a boy (Andy) that gets a new toy (Buzz Lightyear) for his birthday. Andy's previous favorite toy (Woody) feels forgotten. After a series of mis-adventures the two find themselves away from the home and must learn to work together to find their way back. The film is followed by a sequel ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Toy Story 3"" which were just as awesome, if not more so than this one.9/10 easily","

"TOY STORY","TheUnknown837-1","3 May 2008","Tom Hanks and Tim Allen put their talents at voice acting to work and they do it with thorough and complete perfection in ""Toy Story"" a Pixar animated classic film that even now, over ten years since its theatrical debut, continues to be loved by audiences of all ages. It retells the child's dream of their inanimate toys suddenly coming to life whenever a human is not around. All of the toys have personalities and they are even organized as their own society.Tom Hanks plays the voice of Woody, a cowboy doll with a pull string and Tim Allen provides the voice of Buzz Lightyear, a new action figure toy that has crushed all other toys at the market--but the thing is, Buzz believes he is really THE character he represents and not an Asian-made product. Among them there are other toys such as Slinky Dog, voiced by Jim Varney, Rex the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn) and Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles). All of the voices are done well and creates the illusion of real talking characters instead of actors providing voices and then having animators synchronize their 3D models with the prerecorded sounds.Now that I am older, I appreciate and cherish ""Toy Story"" and its successful sequel ""Toy Story 2"" (1999) even more than I did when I first saw them as a kid. I now appreciate the character elements, can understand the point of the jokes better, and respect the talents and efforts of the filmmakers who made this movie possible. I recommend both ""Toy Story"" and its sequel as two of Pixar's best films and some of the best family movies of all time. Children will adore and love it, adults will laugh. Bottom line, it's a great movie.","

"TOY STORY","hanalisss","26 October 2023","Toy Story isn't just a movie; it's a groundbreaking cinematic masterpiece that revolutionized animation and storytelling, leaving an indelible mark on the hearts of audiences worldwide.Pixar's inaugural feature film introduces us to a world where toys come to life when humans aren't around, and the narrative unfolds through the eyes of Woody, the cowboy doll voiced by Tom Hanks, and Buzz Lightyear, the space ranger voiced by Tim Allen. The brilliance of the film lies not just in its imaginative premise but in the emotional depth woven into the story.The characters are brought to life with such charm and personality that they transcend their inanimate status. Woody's journey from the beloved favorite to grappling with insecurities and the arrival of the flashy Buzz Lightyear provides a poignant exploration of friendship and identity. Buzz's journey of self-discovery, realizing he's a toy in a world much bigger than his Space Ranger delusions, is both humorous and touching.The voice acting, led by Hanks and Allen, is pitch-perfect, infusing the characters with nuance and authenticity. Their chemistry becomes the heartbeat of the film, creating a dynamic that's both heartwarming and hilarious.The animation, although now surpassed by newer technologies, was groundbreaking for its time. The attention to detail, the expressive character animations, and the imaginative world-building set a standard for animated films that many strive to achieve.Beyond the visual spectacle, Toy Story excels in its storytelling. The script, co-written by Pixar's creative geniuses, crafts a narrative that appeals to all ages. It tackles themes of friendship, loyalty, and the fear of being replaced with a deftness that elicits both laughter and tears.Randy Newman's iconic soundtrack adds another layer of emotion to the film, with the timeless ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" becoming synonymous with the enduring legacy of Toy Story.What truly makes this movie stand the test of time is its universal appeal. It captures the essence of childhood wonder and the bittersweet reality of growing up. The film doesn't just entertain; it resonates with its audience on a deeply emotional level.In conclusion, this isn't merely a movie; it's a cultural touchstone, a nostalgic trip for adults, and an enchanting experience for new generations. Its influence reverberates throughout the animation industry, and its characters have become beloved icons. The film's ability to blend cutting-edge animation with a heartfelt, timeless story makes it a cinematic gem that continues to enchant audiences, proving that, indeed, toys have a special place in our hearts.","

"TOY STORY","emasterslake","1 October 2005","This was the first Pixar movie I've seen. I remember seeing it back 10 years ago, back when it was new. Back then Pixar wasn't too well known in the world. This movie made their intro and beginning of their long line of great movies.Not only was it Pixar's first movie, but it was also the first ever CGI Movie ever made. Back then I didn't know what CGI was so I didn't had a clue how they even made the movie itself(I was only 7 when I first watched it in theaters).The story to this movie is unlike anything you've seen before. It all has to do with what do Toys do when no one is around to play with them. It features memorable characters and some existing toys like ""Little Tykes, Mr. Potatoe Head, Slinky, Barrel of monkeys, etc."" The main character is Woody a classic Cowboy doll who is the favorite toy of Andy, a kind and good boy. He gets respect and pride from the other toys. Life seems good for him.Till one day on Andy's Birthday, he receives a special toy that any boy would want a ""Buzz Lightyear"" action figure. Who has cool features that not even Woody has. And Woody fears Buzz will be Andy's new favorite toy and lose his respect and pride with the other toys.Toy story has some laughs, excitement, and great visuals for a Well done CGI movie. Every Animation lover should see this movie. If you like this movie, you'll like the sequel even more.I give it an 8/10 perfect movie for the whole family to watch.","

"TOY STORY","sharky_55","22 July 2015","It was May of 1991, and Disney were on the brink of the Animation Renaissance which would bring about a treasure-trove of beautifully drawn and designed 2D films. Only a few months later would the first and very elegant Beauty and The Beast be released. But behind the scenes, they negotiated a deal with a small animation studio named Pixar, previously only animating shorts to demonstrate the capabilities of their computers. John Lasseter would serve as director after being fired from Disney as he pitched the revolutionary idea of the first ever fully computer animated full length feature film. And so Toy Story was born. It was a long and complicated production process full of worries about budget, and the infamous Black Friday reveal which prompted a production shut-down and a full script revamp. It's sequel would later nearly undergo a disaster of similar scale. But after an arduous process Toy Story became a ground breaking film in animation history and set the first benchmark for 3D animation. Toy Story is a beautifully rendered film for its time and eye poppingly gorgeous. Pixar's revolutionary animation process created a living breathing world with every tiny detail lovingly crafted - blades of grass, hairs on head, scuffs on floorboards. The character movement is smooth and seamless, the use of light and shadow realistic. Being Pixar's first ever feature film and under close scrutiny from Disney executives and given a small budget, short cuts like ponytails and short hair were used, and the textures of the background and minor characters are less visually impressive, but Tory Story still holds up remarkably well decades later. It's all wrapped in a stirring score by Randy Newman which easily accompanies the film's movement; lifting for Buzz's first take-off, eerily tip-toeing at the Spaceport Arcade. The main song You've Got a Friend in Me is heartfelt at the start of the film but even more-so at the end, Newman duetting with Lyle Lovett to symbolise the new partnership of Buzz and Woody. The story is a simple but universal one, with an original twist. What happens when toys are alive, and furthermore, what happens when they are replaced by newer, cooler models? The titular characters of Buzz and Woody are stunningly brought to life through fantastic character design and voice-acting. Woody is your classic Western cowboy with a pull string that spouts recorded catchphrases while Buzz Lightyear is a futuristic Space Ranger who has pop-out wings and a laser. Who can compete with that? Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provide a great deal of emotion and character through their respective portrayals; in particular Woody's charm and leadership is a thin veneer for his insecurity and ego which is displayed when Andy gets a newer toy. Terry Gilliam singles out a great shot at the height of Buzz's personality as a Space Ranger, where he discover he is actually just a toy, and where the camera zooms out and the big bravado he was only a moment earlier is now a tiny figure. But apart from them you have a whole cast of iconic characters each with their quirks, personalities and traits; Mr Potato Head, Re the dinosaur, Slinky Dog, Hamm the piggy bank, Bo Peep, the plastic toy soldiers...We get the sense that these toys have been in the Andy household forever, and have formed a tight knit family and well-oiled hierarchy. the sequel 4 years later gives them additional screen-time which comes with more laughs (including the addition of Mr Potato Head's wife). Toy Story set the first benchmark for computer animation and heralded a period of critical and box office success for Pixar. The 2 sequels are also crafted with as much detail and care as the first, but nothing can match the first gasps of wonder and amazement at the movement and freedom of the 3D world when it first hit cinemas in 1995.","

The Next Who Framed Roger Rabbit I love how they try to make something different with CGI, because all they've done in the beginning were commercials and shorts. Ever since John Lasseter saw Tron, he knew that CGI would go all over the place. And boy has Pixar nailed it!The Story has taken itself to a whole new level, it's all about getting back to a young boy by using the power of teamwork, accepting for what you are, and telling the truth in an innocent way. Woody never meant to hurt Buzz, he just wanted to spend his life with Andy. The other toys are blinded by this accident that they decide to toss their leader out like garbage.Sid is what I believe the best villain for three reasons1.He's the bully for the toys2.He's stuck in the mind of a mad doctor or scientist 3.He learns an important lesson that toys are meant to be in heaven, not in toy hell. Unless you're a Losto Bear who thinks that humans are the enemies.Man! This is the reason why people loved the 90's. There was a time when animation wanted to push itself to next level. And Toy Story was one the important examples of being the greatest survivors with a lovely story, fresh start animation, amazing characters, and epic songs by Randy Newman.This could be a fresh start for those who wanna tell stories.In fact I have novel that I'm working on.

"TOY STORY","hall895","8 September 2010","Nowadays people assume that when it comes to what they see up on the big screen computers make absolutely anything possible. If you can dream it you can see it with the assistance of a little computer wizardry. But of course that was not always the case. The computer animation revolution had to start somewhere and that somewhere was Toy Story. The animators at Pixar made the impossible possible. You watch the movie today and it's easy to take it for granted. You forget that Pixar was attempting something entirely new and that there were more than a few doubts as to whether it would work. Oh, it worked alright. It worked spectacularly. Director John Lasseter and his animation team created a visually stunning masterpiece the likes of which had never been seen before. Movie animation would never be the same, Toy Story changed everything.The movie looks great but in order to be deemed a success there had to be a story to match the visuals. All the technological wizardry in the world would not have been able to hide a lousy story. Thankfully that proved to be no concern as we get a compelling and endearing storyline, one which provides plenty of opportunities for some good laughs as well. For as revolutionary as the animation was it is the story and the characters which ultimately make the movie so beloved. To infinity and beyond! Just saying it brings a smile to your face. The toys which are the stars of this story are great, memorable characters. Each is infused with its own unique personality. You can dismiss no toy as ""just a toy"". Each toy has its own story, its own life. All the voice actors deserve great credit for the work they did in making each toy stand out in its own way. Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear are of course the big stars and they both fit their roles perfectly. But whether playing a dog, a pig or a potato head each voice actor was uniformly terrific. R. Lee Ermey as a little green army man and Wallace Shawn as a Tyrannosaurus with serious anxiety issues are two personal favorites. So many characters which are so easy to embrace and each of whom is good for some laughs too. And there's even room for a great villain in Sid, the evil toy-destroying kid next door. A great cast of characters brought brilliantly to life by the great work of the animators and the voice cast.Toy Story triumphs in making you feel for its characters. Who can't empathize with Woody as he fears being pushed aside by Buzz? Who hasn't had insecurities like Rex? Who can't understand Mr. Potato Head's longing for a Mrs. Potato Head? When the toys hurt you hurt, when they triumph you feel as if you shared in it. It's a movie guaranteed to put a smile on your face. If there's any complaint it might be that the movie, at a trim 80 minutes, isn't long enough. We want to spend more time with these toys. Of course we would get the opportunity to do so in sequels to come. But the original movie certainly stands on its own merits. It's a movie you can happily watch again and again. And when you do take the time to really look at the world the animation team created for these toys to inhabit. The level of detail in the backgrounds is just as stunning as the beautifully rendered main characters. No corners were cut in creating a world which looks truly lived in. A whole world magically brought to life. Toy Story was, in its time, unlike anything anyone had ever seen. And all these years later the magic is still there. It's a movie which will be discovered, and loved, by generations to come.","

For the person who thought up the idea of toys coming to life, thank you. You have given this world an imaginative theory, which will be with us every time we leave the room.Though everything about this film is exquisite, the ideology of living toys makes it what it is. When we first see Woody get up off the bed we need to blink a couple of times to make sure its real. Of course with modern technology CGI is hard not to use and this film was one of the first that was used effectively and though has now lost its significance. Nothing is lost in terms of the story however and the visuals and the finest direction Pixar ever achieved until Wall-E help create a warm fun family film. Will any other company beat Pixar on the animation stage? Shrek, Kung Fu Panda and Madagascar, though all good, don't have that extra depth and sophistication Pixar creates so easily.Filled with great laughs and a suspense adventure, Toy Story is a sit down and enjoyable movie for the whole family. But then it is so much more than a movie.Every Pixar movie has a message. Wall-E provided an insight into loneliness and the good of man kind, Monsters Inc told the tale of children's fairy tales and Cars reflects doing something for others.This 1995 hit preaches to its audience through its characters. Woody's jealousy at being replaced and his suffering are almost tear worthy. We have all had our favourite toys and replaced them and this simple message will trigger something deep down inside any viewer. Buzz's commitment to who he really is and his strong beliefs are great in shaping his character and preaching to viewers to believe who they really are.Most importantly though is friendship and how important it can be to get someone out of trouble for the good of someone else. This message is further emphasised through the best Pixar song of all time, ""You've got a friend in me"" Always consistent, always funny and always entertaining, Toy Story is a fun family film that will forever be remembered for its strong messages, entertainment and animation.","

You could freeze any single frame and see specific detail relating to toys and the world they live in.The Pixar crew took their time to pay attention to those details and create a true work of art.Best Character: Buzz

"TOY STORY","anselmdaniel","27 May 2019","This review contains spoilers.Toy Story is a 1995 animated movie produced by Pixar Animation studios. The movie is directed by John Lasseter and written By John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton, and Joe Ranft. The movie features voice acting from Tom Hanks and Tim Allen. The movie is about a world where toys come to life when humans are not watching. An old standing cowboy doll must work with a new astronaut action figure to reunite with their owner.Toy Story is an incredibly solid movie. This movie has an engaging plot and animation style. This movie holds up incredibly well in today's viewing. The movie is timeless. The plot is easy to follow as it is a children's movie. However, there is a lot to enjoy in this movie as an adult. The movie is directed exceptionally well and has themes in this movie that will not bore adult audiences. The plot is aided greatly by its characters. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen play Woody and Buzz incredibly well and this plays off of the story. The characters in this movie have loads of backstory that makes the movie enjoyable.I highly recommend 'Toy Story.'Grade: A","

My 23 month old grand daughter watches this movie regularly, as do I when we are together, and both of us are enthralled, although I am sure for different reasons.There are human lessons to be learned at several levels, plus the technical excellence, make this a truly enjoyable viewing experience.","

"TOY STORY","Animany94","6 August 2017","Firstly, Toy Stoy is just a great and heartfelt movie with great and relatable characters and story. When I say it is the Snow White of CGI, it is because what Snow White did for traditional animation, Toy Story did for CGI. If you look closer at it, you can see the faults in the graphics, but to h*** with that! It was the first of its kind! I cannot add much more to this. Toy Story is a fantastic movie and a milestone in the world of animation. And in comparison to Walt Disney Pictures' classics, the sequels are great too.","

"TOY STORY","Cylex","20 October 2002","I didn't care for most of the characters in this film. They were too mean spirited and I don't like Tom Hanks. The story was sadistic and I have seen better films on this theme. The Christmas Toy by Jim Henson is much warmer. On the good side I enjoyed the minor characters, especially the snake. I also liked the end title duet. The score was good too. I wasn't over impressed by the animation since I consider story & characters to be more important. Since I didn't like those I can't recommend this. But if you do want to see great animation Ice Age & Anastasia are two of the best. Disney are not as cute as they used to be and that is not a good thing. 3/10","

"TOY STORY","agmoldham","3 May 2004","It doesn't matter whether you're young or old, this is a great movie. Woody is Andy's favourite toy and like all the other toys lives with the fear of being discarded when new toys arrive. He's therefore very worried when Buzz Lightyear arrives. Buzz is an instant hit with Andy and Woody is not very happy. To make matters worse Buzz doesn't think he is a toy and believes he is on a mission. The story really gets going when woody inadvertantly knocks buzz out of the house and the two of them end up with evil Syd who tortures toys.There's lots of adult humour meaning that the parents will find this as funny as the kids. The real winning combination of Toy Story is the characterisation and the empathy you can feel for the animated leads. Although they're not real this is one of the best buddy movies ever made. My personal favourite character is Mr Potato Head because of the dry humour. A classic 10/10","

"TOY STORY","bretttaylor-04022","30 January 2023","I think this is one of those films where if you say you don't like it there is something wrong with you.The computer generated animation is amazing.The plot is pure fantasy that surely every Human Being that ever owned toys can relate to.Toys come to life whenever they are alone. It is actually amazing that it had not been done before.The characters are great. Every single one and when they work as a team it is great how they all have their roles to play. Sid is a brilliant villain, the kid who blows up and dismantles toys.There are also lots of jokes and you pick up new jokes as you get older.","

"TOY STORY","TomL123","29 June 2011","This was the movie that started it all for the world of animation. This was the pioneer. Now we all know that when we see a pixar movie ( especially one with the likes of john lassetter involved in it) that we are in for a cinematic experience.This movie fulfills every child's dream. Haven't you ever wondered what your toys do when you aren't there. I know I did when I was a kid, I myself had a buzz lightyear doll and I always imagined him having that Tim Allen voice.not only does it fulfill the child's dream, but there is a ton of easter eggs that pixar has included that will keep the teenagers and adults interested and laughing as well. Even 16 years after the original release date I still watch the movie and I am still finding little subliminal messages (easter eggs) that pixar has included.Disney/ pixar headed by john lassetter do a great job in making an unbelievable movie seem as believable as possible. Just for a second forget that these are toys we are talking about here and imagine that they are real people. Would they have acted any different to how they did? Knowing that what the characters did and how they reacted and how it is on unreasonable to consider that they might act that way is the key to good script writing and good storytelling. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen also do a marvellous job at heading the cast making every line seem funnier or more dramatic than it actually is.Overall i would not just recommend this, this is a MUST SEE for any kid or adult. If you have not seen this what have you been living in a cave? go out there and rent it or buy it NOW.","

"TOY STORY","Nekrofoxx","2 February 2014","The movie isn't just the first one in the Toy Story series, but also the first movie Pixar ever created and they didn't waste any time showing us what they could do.This movie shows what being creative is all about. The soul ingredient of the story is simply what happens when your toys are left alone and the benefits (and downfalls) of being a toy. But what amazes me the most is the emotional connection that it gives to anyone at any age and what keeps it together is the friendship between toys, even though they are only toys, the movie easily grasps the emotions of 2 people turned into best friends.Of course sometime in the future another animated movie will have the same success or more than Toy Story and may even beat it. But Toy Story will always be remembered as the first, and never will be forgotten.","

But if I don't sat it now it'll never be written (by me anyway, I do everything on a whim). This film brings back so many memories from my childhood. Getting my Woodie Talking doll, My plastic Buzz. This film has everything, comedy, adventure, romance, more comedy, it's a perfect family film that I cannot help but watch whenever I see it on TV. The cast list for the voice overs shows that this had potential to be a great film, but it will be a great film for years to come. Great re-watch value. I don't like containing spoilers so I haven't added any. Please Please watch this at least once! =] In summary. Every child, teen, and adult should watch this movie at least one! 10/10","

In this first movie we get to know Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Potato Head and all the others, and I tell you; it's so jolly good entertainment!Seeing things from a toys perspective, is really fascinating and really cool, having stairs as a huge mountain and a aggressive dog is the Devil itself! TOY STORY starts off very wity, and although the movie gets darker and more exciting, it always has this extremely charming and wity undertone. I laughed jolly loud, and it is such a pro made movie that it's already a classic. STARS; 5/5","

"TOY STORY","mieriks","29 August 2022","This movie is filled with funny phrases and jokes, but has also a worthy story about a toy who gets jealous by a new toy who has taken his place of being the favorite toy of the owner. This concept of living toys is a kid's dream come true, but in this case without the kid's awareness. We get into the behind of the scenes: The toys are not just living a simple life, but they have their own community with their own rules, routines, and cultures, brought by all types of toys, everything from a shark toy to a potato head. Every toy has also it's own personality, which gets quite interesting and entertaining. To be the first entirely computer-animated feature film from Disney and Pixar, is a very good start, and as we all know: the beginning of an enormous journey of fantastic animation movies.","

"TOY STORY","ziptorn","2 May 2019","I think we're going to look back at Pixar in 20 years as a study in how to manipulate audience emotions and psychological fine-tuning. This is a classic. At the time, objectively, it's an 8 or 9. But now, watching it again, especially with kids, it becomes obvious that they took an ""inflation adjusted"" CG-friendly aesthetic (toys) and invented the now-popular methods of emotional engineering.",NA

This original might've aged since its release, but it hasn't aged with the storyline. Watching this again, and in 4k, it still resonates a high level of nostalgia. This film spawned a successful series of films, and it's easy to see why. Strong storytelling and a film that wears its heart on its sleeve. The vocal cast is incredible and Pixar grew to become a successful studio thanks to this film. Worth a revisit and to grow the audience over time.

I thought Toy Story was way better than A bug's life, Finding nemo or even ice age which was pretty good. I usually don't like films like this, I'm more of a mature film type person, however it is impossible not to be entertained while watching this. I liked Tim Allen a lot, he stole the show, though hanks did a good job with his character too. Tim Allen needs to do more films like this and less Santa Clause ones, because these are more his type, even if he doesn't show his face. This is one that the kids and the adults can watch and enjoy 9/10",NA

"TOY STORY","baileycrawly","15 November 2020","Toy Story was never my favorite Pixar film. I had the opportunity to see it twice in theaters, once shortly after its initial run when it was given a limited-edition local screening, and once in a 3D double feature released just ahead of Toy Story 3. And, of course, I've had it on VHS, DVD and BluRay to watch multiple times.One of the things I've always admired about Toy Story is how nice the animation looks for the time it was released. Pixar clearly had access to the best equipment and talent when they put this film together, and it shows. There isn't a single aspect of the film that's overlooked. It's got serious star power in the casting department (Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are both incredible, respectively, in their leading roles), you've got a great score (some of the better work from Randy Newman, who I've never been a big fan of personally), it's got a unique story that's executed in just the right way to ensure the proper emotions are being conjured up at any given point during the film. Pixar has what I can only compare to a mathematical equation by which they tell their stories; everything is carefully constructed and calculated, and every move they make in the stories pays off well.It was the most appealing or entertaining of the Pixar stories to me growing up (or even now), but to look at the film and everything it was accomplishing in its time and to say it offers nothing of merit would be blatantly untrue.",NA

"TOY STORY","TheMysteriousReviewer","20 February 2021","Toy Story gives CGI animation a really good start. This movie took its execution on the concept of living toys to a whole new level thanks to a very engaging story. The characters are also highly memorable. And the humor is very clever with some jokes the movie can get away with. The animation can look outdated, but there's no denying it looks really good to this day. This is the kind of CGI animation we had back in the earlier days. Funny enough, I have seen some deleted scenes that I'm honestly glad it didn't make it to the movie. Otherwise, they would keep this from being Pixar's amazing debut. If you're in the mood to watch a comedy or something related to Pixar, this is definitely worth checking out. This movie is all these years that's to infinity and beyond.",NA

To this day, it's still a legendary film, just like most of the other films made by Pixar Animation Studios! Everything is perfect, and fires on all cylinders. The story is still memorable to this day. Very creative premise, it pulls you in and keeps you hooked from beginning to end. The voice acting is perfect from all of the voice actors. They couldn't have picked better voice actors! The animation holds up to this day, as does the animation in the other Pixar films. Finally, the soundtrack is phenomenal and it helps bring this movie to life. You can play a little part from any part of the music score, and be able to identify what movie it is right away. That's the sign of a great soundtrack! Pixar, without a shadow of a doubt, makes the best CGI animated films of all-time. ""Toy Story"" really opened the door to future possibilities, and still influences the world of cinema to this day. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. I give this film a full 5 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. This movie is perfect for people of all ages.

"TOY STORY","departed07","19 March 2005","Kids have always wondered if their toys ever came to life when they were asleep and if the toys themselves had lives of their own by doing the same things that humans do.Toy Story is the first film from Pixar Studios to make cartoons more humanistic with CGI than by drawing them out. Tom Hanks provides the voice of Woody the Cowboy, who is the ringleader of the toys around Andy's room. He overhears the important events around Andy's life and one of the things shocking is that they are moving to another home.Most of Andy's toys are compiled of average boy toys: from a nervous dinosaur name Rex (Wallace Shawn) to a grumpy Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickels), a smart Aleck piggy bank called Hamm (John Ratzenburg); even Andy's little sister has toys that join with the gang, Bo Peep (Annie Potts of ""Ghostbusters"" fame) has a crush on the cowboy. There are other characters in the story; a dog on a string name Slinky Dog (Jim Varney of ""Ernest"" fame) and a plastic army doll name Sarge (R. Lee Ermey of Full Metal Jacket).One of the elements of ""Toy Story"" is very psychological, and that is the fear of a new toy. Sure everybody likes to get a new toy, but the problem is that when people buy new toys, they automatically forget that their old toys exist and lose excitement within them. When Andy's birthday party comes a week before the leave, Woody sends Sarge and the plastic army men with the baby talkers to hear what kind of presents Andy has gotten this year. As Mr. Potato jokes that he wants a wife, the gang gets cut off by a nervous Rex and realize that the toys have to stay still.The new toy in Andy's life is the popular and all out, Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) in which he pushes Woody to the side leaving the new toy on the bed. Everybody clamors over Woody being pushed off the bed as every other toy in the room tries to figure out what's up there.Woody is introduced to the new character as he tells everyone he can fly and fire a high laser. A smart-ass Potato Head makes a statement about Woody's voice box that it sounds a car ran over it. Days before the move, Woody is left out of the group as everybody including Bo Peep are all with Buzz Lightyear.Woody has a plan of getting rid of Buzz and he uses an electric race-car to push him out the window. Now every toy is against Woody and want to beat him up; but Andy saves Woody when him and the rest of his family are going out for pizza and can't find Buzz, so Andy takes the cowboy instead. With little relief, when the car stops at a gas station, Buzz has been hiding under the car and fights with Woody outside; suddenly the car leaves with both toys stranded.Buzz has a plan for both him and Woody to get back with Andy; they get into a pizza truck and try to find Andy and his family and notices that the neighborhood bully Sid is there so the toys hide in a toy machine where they are taken with another toy back to Sid's house where one toy is torture to death (relax, its not the main toys). So now they have to work together in order to be with Andy and tell the other toys that everything is all right.""Toy Story"" is a blessing with delight and wonder and just like my review of ""Monsters, Inc."" it's a movie of curiosity and a joy to behold.",NA
"TOY STORY","andrewroy-04316","22 June 2019","Honestly, I don't think I can fully appreciate Toy Story's boldness and uniqueness, as Pixar has since made great family computer generated animated movies ubiquitous, and I certainly have been able to take that for granted my whole life. Even so, watching Toy Story for the first time in over a decade, it exceeded my expectations in its characters and script, and the animation looks as good as ever. Woody's internal struggles and seeing a protagonist of a kid's movie be clearly flawed but still likable is so refreshing. I love the animosity between Woody and Buzz, and the way the toys each have their own quirks but are something of a hive mind. Even if the events that occur are a bit over the top, the structure and plot is actually really exciting and coherently presented. I loved the misjudgement of Sid's toys and their role in the success. I've seen movies twice as long fail to deliver on half as realistic and well fleshed out characters or emotional stakes as in Toy Story. Between the groundbreaking animation for the time, the consistent characters and plot, and sheer adolescent joy and adventure, Toy Story deserves its place as a classic.",NA

Special mention for Tom Hanks as you really cannot separate his voice from Woody's character. It works on every level. Kids love it, as do teenagers, young adults and pensioners like me too. The songs by Randy Newman are not too intrusive and actually enhance the story and move it on too. The amount of work that must have gone into the brainstorming before production started must have been amazing. It would have been great to have an insight into all that.
